"1","I don't get all the terrible reviews for this movie. Especially because lots of people talk incredible bad of the special effects. It's not Oscar worthy, but is not terrible. It's quite good for such type of movie.It lacks some quality on the script, but which shark movie doesn't?There's some other little mistakes, but overall is watchable. If you are a fan of this genre, o recommend you check it out this one.Ignore the below 4 scores. It's unfair for those who work in this project.","5","margarida-44311"," Not Bad

"3","Great White is not the worst way to spend 90 minutes but it does have issues. In the film seaplane tour operators Charlie and Kaz with their cook Benny take out a wealthy couple Joji and Michelle to Impervious Reef. There they find a victim of a shark attack and head back. On the way back they see an overturned boat, go to check it out and their plane sinks. They end up in a raft and get stalked by a a couple of great white sharks which are hunting together.There is some tension in the film and the characters don't feel like cheap cardboard cutouts. All of them were fleshed out just enough that the viewer actually cares about what happens to them. The CGI is not great though and this was clearly done on a tight budget. The filmmakers tried to keep the sharks in the darkness and shadows as much as possible and this helps. There are however a few shark scenes that look very poor and this is a problem together with the ludicrous action in the final act as it becomes very unrealistic. Overall the first 30 minutes where the characters are introduced are good, the second act has some suspense but the action in the final third of the film is both unbelievable and predictable at times.Overall this wasn't great given the story line and the budget constraints but was watchable. The acting is mostly decent. The film is not realistic especially in the final third but overall it is better than many shark themed thriller horrors. There are some cool shots and suspenseful moments but it could have been much better if the story was better developed.","4","nebk"," Great White=Jaws Lite

"4","Great White is as basic of a killer shark film as possible. Everyday people surviving a pack of ordinary sharks, not super-enhanced, not vengeful, nothing like the Deep Blue Sea or Jaws IV, or Meg, whatever.My guess is that they were aiming at a more grounded approach, and it worked ok until a certain point. I think that real sharks probably wouldn't jump out of the water and intercept you mid-air in a bloody fashion, but this kinda takes away the interest from the film. They provide a bare minimum of information about the characters, but this is still a killer shark film and you expect something different from the very basic and tired concept.My biggest problem with it was that up until 50! Minutes into the film, nothing really happens, they just wrap up the set-up. There is also a very awkward racial or ethnic conflict which I did not understand at all, it just felt super forced.It's not spectacular, it's not gory and fun, it's not original in any way, so while I can say that it was a film, I can't think of a reason for anyone to watch it.","4","kuarinofu"," Bare-bones killer shark film
"
"5","Terrible story, dialogue and CGI. The film has a predictable outcome. But I did like the cinematic wide shots and the overhead birdseye view shots with the sea plane that were done for the first act. Even in SDR, the seascapes were impressive. I can only imagine how much nicer it would have looked in HDR. The rest of the camera work, not so much. I didn't like the rapid closeup edits for the rest of the film.","4","Horror_Flick_Fanatic"," Terrible story, dialogue, and CGI

"6","Whilst the 'shark survival' sub genre has plenty of contributors it's probably fair to say that many, if not most, are really let down by either sub standard vfx or by really non committal performances. The few that stand out, including the Reef, The Shallows, and Open Water, do so because they don't skimp on those two very important components. As far as stories go it's very hard to offer much in the way of differentiation. By its very nature the sub genre puts people, mainly young adults admittedly, at the mercy of the ocean's top predatory fish, which through over reliance on the biggest and most recogniseable, as opposed to the most voracious or scheming, becomes a little predictable and trite at times. Great White for me sits firmly in the middle of all these shark movies. It's a predictable story with a predictable setup and outcome. Like many horror movies do, it invites, through its simplicity, audiences to predict who will die when, based on stereotypical characters and character traits. That said, Great White is entertaining enough, blending good performance with live shark footage and enough 'below water, above water' cinematography to induce suspense. What lets it down rather badly are the few occasions where the VFX sharks fall into the Sharknado realm of shoddy and ineffectual. And that's a pity, as with The Shallows level of CGI this could quite easily have avoided the one major pitfall of films in this sub genre - it's too dangerous to get real up close footage to convince. So if you have to fake it - don't appear to be faking it. KONTIKI is your reference if you need to see VFX sharks done seamlessly. Anyway, this is certainly not a bad film, it's entertaining and passable as an entry alongside the films already mentioned. Those who have slammed it unashamedly really are doing it a disservice and frankly their critiques or opinions are little more than the chum that minor characters in this type of film become.","6","NickyDee07938"," A decent effort

"9","The film is meh when it comes to these types of films. Characters are lame and stereotypical but is that a bad thing with these films? No, I don't think so but maybe a little more time could be made to build them up a bit.The shark looks bad, very bad. It's amazing that the shark in Jaws looks better and that was in the 70's! One of the biggest issues I have with films today is the use of bad cgi and using camcorders for movies. This one has really bad cgi of the shark.There are better shark films that have come out since Jaws and this is not it. If you have low expectations, as I did, you will probably still be disappointed.","4","phobicsq"," Typical movie for the genre

"11","At least well 2/3's of the movie, its grumpy men and voulnerable women, not as old as me though, but quarelling just like theyve always done in castaway movies since the birth of cinematology.Its a trip to the gbr area of australia, a paradise turns into hell due to a great white dork of a shark, sinking their main transportation vehicle, and and do the spagat move into the saafety of a rubber dongi,rolliing the perpendicular waltz rythm of the great pacific ocean. Some small attacks occurs, accompanied with a terribly loud sound and musical effects... and thats it. Will they survive?? I shall not reveal anything...i am modestly speaking extremely disapointed by the poor ingenouity by the makers, and i wont mention all the breakwaters and sandbottom and shifting sky that the editor has had to work with, the obvioiously moored rubber dingy is pretty bad obscured, and my compulsive answer to everyone wanting to see a good shark film, just forget this one. The script is written in the sand at the nearby beach, and of course they are pregnant with a wowsharknado concept is actually far better thinks the grumpy old man, even though i dont like them either.

"12","Many have tried to replicate the success of Steven Spielberg's Jaws and have not yet succeeded. This film too often puts the viewer on a buffer, as with a bad Internet, and does not help at all to understand what is happening. The creators had an ocean of opportunities and they missed them. Two things worry me: what the sharks have done, that they are forced to shoot in this, and how you and I will survive this film.","3","seventhriotontheship"," Jaws 57

"16","Finally a shark movie that is well-worth diving into, if you don't mind swimming with great white sharks.I sat down to watch the 2021 movie ""Great White"" from writer Michael Boughen and director Martin Wilson with no expectations. I was dreading that it was going to be just another run-of-the-mill shark movie, you know, the ones that come a dime a dozen. But still, I've always enjoyed shark movies, ever since watching ""Jaws"" as a child. So of course I sat down to watch ""Great White"".I have to say that the movie's cover/poster definitely was helping to win me over and make me have an interest in watching the movie.Right, well on to it. ""Great White"" is a movie that you should treat yourself to watching, especially if you enjoy shark movies. Because this 2021 movie is a movie that is driven by a good story, well-rounded characters, excitement and also a sense of despair from the marooned people adrift. So that was a major accomplishment on director Martin Wilson's behalf.The storyline is as interesting as it is exciting. Sure, it is a rather generic storyline if you look at it objectively. I mean, you have a shark that accidentally causes five people to become marooned at sea, with hundreds of miles to the shoreline, as it causes their airplane to sink - gee, now where have we seen that before? Duh dum, duh dum, dum, dum, dum, dum.... get it? But at the same time, it is also a storyline that is well-written as it managed to snatch you up and bring you along right there in the raft alongside the marooned five. So writer Michael Boughen definitely made things work.There is a good amount of excitement and thrills in the movie, as there should be in any good shark movie. And it worked so nicely in this movie, especially because there was such a good balance between the hopelessness of being marooned so far out at sea and the feel of being stalked by a great white, knowing it is there in the water but rarely see it come to the surface. I most certainly enjoyed that aspect of ""Great White"".Something else that made the movie work out so well was the impressive character gallery. Sure, the movie have only five people in it, essentially, but these characters are so well-rounded and nicely fleshed out, given personalities, quirks, traits, etc. Which made for a very lively movie, and you get sucked in right away, taking an instant liking to some character and a dislike to another. That was really nice work from writer Michael Boughen. And also a big thumbs up to the cast in the movie. They had casted some really talented actors and actresses for this movie, with the likes of Katrina Bowden (playing Kaz), Aaron Jakubenko (playing Charlie), Te Kohe Tuhaka (playing Benny), Tim Kano (playing Joji) and Kimie Tsukakoshi (playing Michelle). Great cast choices and great individual performances by the cast in this movie. And it should be said that the cast definitely made this movie more than watchable.The sharks in the movie were definitely good and felt very real, especially since it was a combination of real footage and a prop. And the prop looked really realistic, which added so much to the movie. The only downside here, was the sound that they added to the sharks, sort of a growling thing going on. That was just idiotic. Sure, I get it for terms of thrills and entertainment for the movie. But no, it just dumbs it down. Sharks are silent predators, keep it realistic and keep them soundless. But it was a minor annoyance in the movie, which didn't really impact the overall enjoyment of the movie. It was just a stupid little thing that sat like a thorn in the side of me.If you are only going to watch a single shark movie this year, make it ""Great White"", because this movie is so well-worth taking the time and effort to sit down and watch. I was more than genuinely entertained by what this movie offered, and it is one that I can warmly recommend.My rating of ""Great White"" lands on a seven out of ten stars. This is one of those instances when it is a shark movie done right.","7","paul_haakonsen"," A very exciting and thrilling shark movie...

I have seen worse movies,dull movies that have got higher ratings than this and this movie does not deserve the low ratings.

The cast give long meaningful looks at each other, the only trouble is the specific meaning of the look is utterly lost due to bad acting and worse writing. Take a drink every time they did this and you'd not last to the end of the film. The shark action is very minimal. Mostly the movie consists of people in a raft being utterly dumb. Seriously, they don't unpack the survival box until the second day in the boat. They don't conserve the water when it rains, despite having no bottled water left. Every single time the shark attacks they all stand up, the women scream and then they all fall overboard because they are standing. Even when they get to some rusting hulks in the water which are entirely stable, when they see the shark the women scream and fall over into the water. That was my favourite bit. I actually skipped the last five minutes of this. By that stage I didn't care if they lived or died. I was rooting for the shark.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","JICNZ"," Worth A Watch For Comedic Value Only

"30","A seaplane operator couple and their passengers become stranded miles from shore.In a sea of shark survival films, Open Water, Reef, Adrift to name a few, director Martin Wilson offers one of the better-made outings of the genre. However, writer Michael Boughen's dialogue and setups are at times painfully repetitive. There's only so many times people can fall out of a raft or stupidly argue. Thankfully, Wilson delivers some interesting camera tricks along with Tony O'Loughla's cinematography and creates a scary feeling with the black abyss and scale of the open sea. While the CGI is a little hit and miss, the real shark footage and on-location shots keep things visually interesting.It's played straight and the cast do their professional best with some lapses in logic. Great White has its own actress Katrina Bowden (a Christine Taylor lookalike) channels Blake Lively as Kaz. Bowden does a great job alongside Mathew Matthew McConaughey-alike Aaron Jakubenko who plays a likeable shark attack survivor Charlie Brody.Subjectively it's better than 47 Meters Down: Uncaged and Frenzy (which also features a plane crash) but is debatably not as good as The Shallows or 47 Meters Down. Along with the fantastic looking and well-staged shipwreck last act, the scenery, makeup effects and the real shark footage is impressive.The fact that it carries the title - Great White - you go in expecting more, not just a two-for-one on great whites. Nevertheless, Wilson does well with the budget, building enough tension and creating shark scares to make it worth a watch.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","amesmonde"," A mixed bucket of chum with a great last act.

Kaz is pregnant so she must be the final girl by ""B"" movie code. The plane has an issue (it sinks) and we end up with five people in a rubber raft who somehow keep falling out.Katrina Bowden did well against flying piranhas so a Great White shouldn't be too much of an issue.

The island is not suited for sightseeing or comfort so why bring the wife and the cook? I know, more bait for the sharks who hold grudges and can scream under water.That's the whole plot. The rest I leave to your imagination. Don't try too hard. Well help me understand how/why they brought a 10 man inflatable dingy along.

"34","I also cannot fathom some reviewers either as one of the other reviewers also has stated. I do agree, it is ""Not Bad"" even though I suspect margarida-44311 is a shill with only 4 reviews under her belt - The shark effects are actually, quite surprisingly, pretty passable for a low budget shark movie; with the exception of a bit of dodgy CGI when it attacks the plane it is pulled off quite adequately !Acting is decent for the main part and the photography, beach shots and locations are quite lush and some nice drone shots, and some nasty gore shots of half eaten bodies all add a professional touch.Unfortunately the story is a bit lacking and the same old cliches and a similar ending stolen from The Shallows make it wholly very unoriginal and to be honest, unlike great shark films like The Reef or Open Water, what it majorly lacks is any tension or that palpable sense of fear and dread that those other superb films brought to the table and that is what mainly sinks this one for me!I still give it a fair 4/10 as it will make a Friday nights viewing with some sherberts and popcorn but it won't be an epic film evening!","4","omendata"," Not bad for a low budget shark movie - Shark effects are actually quite good!

Extremely scary and in my opinion it is just as good as the popular flicks like Adrift.I don't understand why people have given this such a low rating. What more can you expect from a movie about a group of people stranded in the sea being hunted by great white sharks? I've read reviews claiming that the acting is below par but I don't agree. Perhaps Tim Kano's performance was a little bland but not bad enough to drag the movie down a notch. I thought the characters very believable. Kimie Tsukakoshi is totally gorgeous, along with Katrina Bowden so no complaints there. The cinematography was breathtaking, the sharks very scary and the tension certainly had me on the edge of my seat.Just one criticism; in one scene the shark got himself stuck which is unrealistic because sharks have to keep moving or they die. The water needs to pass through their gils or they drown. I'm not going into any more details as I don't want to add spoilers.Well worth a watch, I would recommend it. 8/10 from me..","8","paul-ayres-60784"," Some very tense moments.

The characters were alright, aside from one which really annoyed the crap out of me! The film however was short at 1 hour & 21 minutes, but felt longer due to it mostly being the group moaning & talking to each other while floating endlessly.But my main hate towards this film is the sexism. All the Male characters die & all the females live (how original), once again it's typical in the 2020's that men can't be hero's & save the day, cause women apparently don't need men (who are treated as useless in films like this) to save them from danger, how typical! How EmPowErInG! How Wo0Ke! Seriously? Why do films have to be like this? Can't good films be made anymore?

It's basically a tamed down shortened movie version of Money Heist, but not nearly as cleverly or suspensefully written. Plus I feel Freddie Highmore was a poor casting choice.

"56","Brilliant start, with some beautiful visuals, although they missed the trick of the correct way to shoot from hundreds of years ago, to present day in one shot, but on we go.I confess I'm not overly familiar with Highmore, but within seconds I looked up from what I was doing with a gasp of 'what'! He sounds like & has the charisma of a librarian talking through a sock & a thick one at that, I barely got half of what he was saying & the embarrassing 'you're a genius kid' dialogue was cringe. How Freddy is where he is, surely is a testament to the ridiculousness of Hollywood, or most films of today. PS - I like librarians.Famke Janssen, when I realised that's who it was, appears to have had an argument with herself & taken it out on her face. My advice, as someone who's had a little nip tuck Ms Janssen, is to leave it a little longer before you agree to filming & or get a lawyer versed in medical malpractice.As to the 'movie', I went & put the kettle on.","2","heratyplant"," Great First 5 Minutes, Then Oh Dear!

When you watch halfway through a movie and nothing even remotely pulls you into it, then why watch the other half?

It stinks of lazy writing, and I can't stand a lazilly concocted screenplay. Some great actors, all of whom are wasted on this film. With such bland dialogue even the greatest of actors wouldn't be able to pump life into it. It's just not good... at all. Don't waste your time.

"71","Tense and entertaining. Very well filmed, cast, acted, edited, sound design, locations, visuals, etc. It's a very good package for a heist movie. It doesn't really do anything mind-blowing or memorable, but I have no complaints at all, which is rare. It feels VERY realistic, which sometimes is not fun (when you've seen Mission Impossible 4.. you get a taste for the fantastic and grounded). If you haven't seen it and want to pass the time with a well crafted product, I'd say ""go for it""....Now..
Normally, I qualify movies as a whole. But I tend to put emphasis on the beginning (Marriage Story being a fine example). If I'm immediately turned off is no good, but also how easily and smoothly I'm introduced to this new world. I tend to be easily dissuaded because of everything I've already watched in my lifetime. And then there is the ending (like the anime Code Geass s02), which is the most important part of it all. If the story ends and you feel hollow, disappointed or let down.. then the time you spent watching feels even heavier, a sense of wasted of time.This movie failed me in one of these regards, just a bit. That plus the averageness of the script in comparison to others, lowers what would be a high score for me. And this was a choice.. I can't agree to it, but it isn't my film. Could have been better.","6","daisukereds"," Very good! But..

You even don't care about the characters; you only may wish they succeed. They are not facing their fate, their doom. It is agreeable though, but I begin to get tired of those films.

"91","In 2008, Walter Moreland (Liam Cunningham) leads a team salvaging a wreck when the Spanish police confiscates the treasure. Unbeknownst to the authorities, the treasure is more than what it appears to be. It's a road map to a greater treasure and Moreland needs to steal it back. The big problem is that the government has placed it in an unbreachable vault in the Bank of Spain. In order to solve the problem, Moreland hires genius engineering college student Thom Laybrick (Freddie Highmore) who is tired of being recruited by big oil. They have an opportunity during the 2010 World Cup.This is a fun little caper. It's not that complicated. Liam Cunningham is always great. The two problems are Freddie Highmore and the vault. Freddie is always going to look like a kid and I can't see him as a romantic lead. Astrid Bergès-Frisbey may as well pat him on the head. He is probably never going to heat it up. He's going to be an adorable puppy even on his death bed. The second is the vault construction. I don't really see how it's set up. It's essentially the gold idol in Indiana Jones. In Indy, the premise doesn't need explaining because it's such a small part of it and it is what it is. In this movie, the scale construct is central to the story and so it needs to work. Couldn't they place more counterweight which they do in the emergency situation anyways? Couldn't they just do that earlier? I'm not sure if the story is mechanically sound. Overall, this movie is a good escapist fare although two hours may be unnecessarily long.","6","SnoopyStyle"," fun little caper

"92","On the heisters vault, where its gonna be heisted by the finders that lost their heist in the beginning...that was terribly written, but its more or less a treasure hunt where the treasure is first to be found, lost and then retained in a european way of criminal film style.its not a bad film, its just that it uses well cliched methods to the game of entering the vaults, even the trap mechanisms are unoriginal, so its a ''seen it all before'' movie. but its a pretty tense movie in periods, well made score and the acting just as you expect. though i didnt like the casting of ''the good doctor'' with his spectrumized behaviour and pinnochio diamond twinkling eyes as the young ''brain'' of the coup, the rest is within the limits.so its a film of suspence ,shortage of time, many money and very fast shifting pace, with little time to rest. so if you wanna gain some good outta this, then pay attention to the small details, its all in there ,its just hard to trace. its a recommended film thinks the grumpy old man","7","ops-52535"," its a major heist...

He knows within that load there is are pieces that point to a bigger treasure.In order to get that pieces back, he lures Thom (Freddie Highmore, a little static but still charismatic) a young nerd but very smart engineer still trying to save the world and more interested in adventures than money.There are some other English speaking characters involved; a love interest (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey as Lorraine, quite good), a former special units (Sam Riley) and an MI6 shady operative (played by Famke Janssen).On the Spanish side we the always excellent Jose Coronado (as the bank security chief ) and Luis Tosar as the get anything man. Considering how good they are and that is an Spanish production; they probable deserved more important roles (specially Tosar); but still they get a decent screen time and their brief moments.The script is adjusted to root for the thieves; so they have to be the ""GOOD GUYS"" of course.The first part of the movie where information is being collected requires some suspension of disbelief but still works. The third act when the heist start is very well executed and both sides match their intelligence and mistakes.The end is well and open joke but satisfying.In brief is well crafter heist movie; with some original elements and able to keep your interest for almost two hours. Considering other recent movies are far less entertaining; this one is highly recommended.","9","abisio"," A heist movie worth your time

"99","This is a extremely by the numbers, safe heist film. That is fine, i didn't go into it wanting to see a genre subverting heavy hitter. I would have simply taken competent and failing that something fun. I watched this in April 2021 and my standards have hit bedrock and started digging. Still I was disappointed.The movie had one key issue. Casting... The main character Thom, played by Freddie Highmore is so awful. I didn't like him 'Good Doctor' and sadly I think he borrows a lot of traits from his character in that show. I hate him in this. He has zero, '0!' chemistry with the rest of the cast.He is the guy you get if you want a super awkward, stilted performance of a genius who can't hold a conversation. The problem is they had hm being the sudo hollywood star that saves the day and gets the girl. You can't have it both ways with this lack laster script, and a actor with such little charisma.The rest of the cast aren't anything to phone home about either. Not because I feel they acted badly, but because of chemistry. Again... They don't play off each other, they look uncomfortable to be in eachothers company. They could have subbed their co-stars for brick walls.Verdict:
Avoid, it's a good looking, competent movie with alright passing. Unfortunately it is beyond average in all other regards.I would highly recommend watching something like Flawless if you haven't. Otherwise just a rewatch any of the oceans films. Even 8... If you want something a little lighter and silly go with 'now you see me'","3","jacob_leighh"," Zero effort, 'Way Down' on inspiration.

"110","Walter (Liam Cunningham) and his Salvage crew found a treasure chest from a Spanish Galleon long submerged, but the Spanish government denies Walter the treasure. Walter hires Thom (Freddie Highmore), a student engineer to figure out a way to get the treasure from the underground Vault of Bank of Spain, which is heavily guarded and impossible to break into. This can't be good.Once Walter and his crew draw up the plans a wrinkle occurs and that is Gustavo (Jose Coronado) the Chief of Security for the Bank of Spain and he knows the Bank is at risk during the World Cup Football Game between Spain and the Netherlands. He knows because his cleaning crew job was cancelled, but found out there was another cleaning crew on the premises. Oh, oh..........Yes, this is like a Mission Impossible story. Don't try to memorize everything, just go with it. The real problem to be solved is that once the Vault is breached it will lower itself into water and anyone captured in it will drown. Thom needs to find a way to prevent the Vault from going into the water.Here is what they are looking for. Back in the day, the Pirate Francis Drake sunk the Spanish ship took the treasure and hid it away marking on 3-coins the exact whereabouts of the treasure. So the 3-Coins are what are needed and they are in the treasure chest Walter took up from the sunken Spanish ship.Notables: Astrid Berges-Frisbey as Lorraine, part of Walter's crew and helps Thom figure things out; Axel Stein as Klaus, Walter's computer hacking guy; Luis Tosar as Simon, who is someone who can get anything needed; Sam Riley as James, Walter's hot-headed right-hand man who takes a dislike to Thom; Famke Jansen as Margaret a British Civil Servant who betrays Walter.Toward the end the Vault is breached and the water comes in. You knew that would happen, right?This is a good heist movie and gets exciting near the end. You keep asking about a twist. Yes, there is one.

"134","This movie is for those who can turn off your mind and just enjoy things being destroyed. Here's why:
1) Every character death was annoying and pointless. For example, the first girl to die was betrayed and left in the kitchen. It would have been fine if they left her there to die and maybe it would create some tension in the group. Nope. She comes storming back into the hallway and then dies in front of anyone... without pointing out that the dude betrayed her. Also, why didn't anyone shoot the zombies around her? They just watched her die. Example #2: the German dude... finally uses a brain cell and decides to go for the vault. This was obviously the smart move... but he closes his friend in there and dies outside. What was his plan? To lock his friend in and just wait out there with the other zombies? What a moron. Hop in... then pull it in to close it. Example #3, the chick holding the head. Why not set the head on the floor, aim at it and walk back into the chopper. Nope. She decides to sacrifice herself. For no reason. Nice. Also, why was she carrying it around?2) The daughter is insufferable. Her reasoning for even being in the movie is a joke. She cares soooo much about this random mom that she just has to go back in there for her. False. When the helicopter crashes, the chick doesn't look for the mom or care about her at all. She only goes up to her dad. The script just forgets about the mom. I honestly was hoping the daughter would die because she only complicated things and makes bad decisions. Why assume the people are in the Olympus? Why not ask your dad to go with you? Why not bring more than a pistol into the quarantine area? But apparently we should care about her because the main character does.3) Every shot is a headshot. Even the daughter shoots the main zombie in the head twice from 50 yards. The zombies decide to not bit when they are clearly in biting distance. This basically made the movie boring because you knew the main characters weren't in any danger until a scene was coming to a close.4) They leave the gate wide open when walking into the quarantined area. This killed me. I guess I should have stopped thinking at this point in the movie.5) If the bad dude's plan was just to get the vile of blood, then why not shoot the scout. Take its blood and leave. Tell the group they will get paid and let's go back now. Nope. Betray everyone for no reason (tell them you'll kill the helicopter pilot for no reason) and go for a head of the main chick. Cool.6) Why did the zombies keep some people for a few days? No explanation... just need to keep the mom alive so the girl is justified in ruining everything. Actually.. why would the girl even assume she was alive. What a dumb character.7) Robot zombies? What? Why? I assume the Mexico City sequel will explain that the government created the alphas to control the others and use the zombies as weapons. But IDK. Cause it seemed like the government wanted zombie blood, which they could have gotten if that was the case. Makes no sense.6/10 is generous. Only points given are for... releasing a movie during covid. At least it made me go to the theater.","6","mitchellkendrickwhite"," Major Spoilers - Everything wrong with this movie

"137","Besides being a beat for beat, and markedly inferior, Aliens rip off. After Scream and Cabin in the Woods which parodied character stupidity in horror movies, ZL makes sure that each and every character chooses the absolute worst decision possible.Of all the complaints about length, you can excise the execrable daughter and the illegal aliens plot line and you wouldn't even notice. In fact this entire plot line feels like it was tacked on at the last minute as a tribute to his Zach's daughter.How is it that even rank amateurs can get off head shots so easily? Is it really that easy to hit someone's head while they are running at you? More than 1/2 the shots in the movie were head shots.How do you get out of a vault from the inside? And even if you don't suffocate, won't the immense radiation from the explosion at ground zero kill you near instantly? How can he walk miles and miles in the desert and not die of thirst and somehow find a car? How come he turns into a zombie days to weeks afterwards while everyone else is zombified within minutes?If the entire idea was to get some blood, why did they have to do this entire charade about getting the money? There was another team that died at the first gate, why didn't they just get the blood from a rando zombie and leave? Why didn't the mole just tie up the queen zombie in the first 20 minutes, get blood and leave them to their heist? Even better, the government had the king zombie in custody. Why didn't the government just take the blood then? (since Tanaka appears to be working with the military)why why whyZL can produce great visuals.

"139","I don't bother with trailers and previews so thought it would be the same zombie world as Dawn but in a different setting and stage of the outbreak. Dawn is great and captures the mood perfectly and has a great cast. This is full of annoying cardboard cutout characters with a stupid plot with some zombies acting more like deranged humans from Mad Max or The Hills Have Eyes. Everything about this felt forced and lacked genuine emotion or tension from the getting the team together scenes to the 'heartfelt' scenes between Scott and Kate (I had to look up their names) to the mission itself (oh they're there already) and the inevitable finale. I've no idea why certain people didn't just fly in with a helicopter and get what they really wanted. I just found it all very dull and didn't care at all what happened.","3","pizzadudes"," Disappointing

"140","I rated it 2/10 just because of the stunning visuals. There's nothing original about it.

"141","***Possible mild spoilers ahead ***I had such high hopes for this one. The slow-pacing of the first act promises something more than the typical two-dimensional characters, but it never pays off. When the action finally starts, it's just a sequence of events - this happens then that happens then something else happens. None of the character choices are driven by their backstories, they just do things to move things along to the next set piece. The pacing if awful. Just when the action gets up some steam, we pause for extended, quiet dialog scenes that add nothing to the story. Arguably the two most intiguing characters - the zombie leader and his...girlfriend? Are given no backstory at all. The action pieces are shot well enough, but nothing is all that original or memorable. The dialog is cringe worthy in a typical Zack Snyder way. The musical choices try too hard to be clever (Elvis singing ""We're caught is a trap..."", the Cranberries classic song ""Zombie""...) are just too on the nose to be amusing. Overall the movie is waaaay too long. By the time we hit the 2-hour mark (with another half hour to go!) I had given up caring about any of the charavters and just wanted them to drop the nuke already so I could get on with my life. Snyder fanboys will no doubt love it, as is evident by all the 9 and 10 star reviews, but for the rest of us, this one is easily skipped.","5","dcj2"," What happens in Vegas...I didn't really care.

"143","With the exception of Tig Notaro's character, I couldn't wait each of them to go.I came in with low expectations, as with most Zombie movies. But one does expect a fun campy horror/gore flick. The plotline seemed to have promise...Dave Bautista is recruited to build a team that'll go into the Zombie infested Las Vegas to fetch $200 millions dollars sitting in a casino vault. Sounds like it'll be fun to watch.The first problems comes when you see the team that is presented and you immediately hate every single one of them with the exception of Tig. You hope that these folks would bond at some point, but they never really do. When an attempt to create some bonds, it just falls flat and is not very genuine.The second big problem is the storyline splits off in several incomprehensible arcs which repeatedly breaks the flow of the story. The father reconnecting with his daughter arc is just silly and predictable.The action sequences are pretty good, though some are a little over the top, but enjoyable to watch. The Zombies themselves have are well done but they get lost in the mishmash of the story arcs. And the ending was pretty good though not great.In conclusion, this isn't a bad film, I just wished that Zack would have trimmed down some of the subplots and given us more Zombie action.","3","lukerlemieux"," Let's suck the fun out of a Zombie movie by adding hateful characters and awful plotline.

"145","Between Snyder and Bautista, I had decent expectations for this movie. After all, I really like Snyder's Dawn of the Dead. However, despite a promising trailer, Army of the Dead offers nothing new to the genre and doesn't even offer much excitement in the unnecessary 2.5 hour run. It was made to seem that this was some elite team put together for the heist, yet most of the characters seem pretty useless and make annoyingly stupid decisions. It's also amazing how seemingly unprepared they all were for once they got into Vegas. I thought this movie would at least have some stylistic action, as it was clearly lacking in substance, but most of the action was just cheesy (and not in the good, fun way).I won't even get into the plot holes, basic logic/physics and other similar issues, because I didn't go into this movie with high standards on those factors. But as others have said, a lot of things just don't make sense with this movie.The trailer and the opening credits were probably the most entertaining part about this movie. If you're on the fence about watching this, save your time.","5","ctimmons-20908"," Lacking Style and Substance

"146","A number of reviewers have already taken shots at the huge plot holes and ridiculous setup of this movie; I share in both their criticism and disappointment. If you happen to care about such lofty things like coherent storytelling or character development, I'd wait to watch this lazy entry into the zombie genre until you're either drunk or stoned to overlook its many problems.And while Zack may have gotten some kind of personal thrill out of manning every major job in this project, the outcome has clearly suffered as a result. What could have been an otherwise outstanding zombie action flick, given proper attention to detail and an avoidance of lazy tropes, is instead no more than another sparkly yet mediocre piece of cookie-cutter movie confection.The fact that more movie goers aren't outraged by the significant and apparently permanent drop in quality/intelligence of most these blockbuster Hollywood productions is what bewilders me. Apparently, just shoveling an old retread of a story into a production-line CGI machine is enough to satisfy most of today's audience, who blithely flock to, praise, and subsidize whatever vapid POS comes out.

"149","What a waste of time. I thought his Dawn of the Dead, filled with plotholes was poorly done. But this-this ridiculous mess. This is the kind of movie where you get a bunch of ten year olds together, have them shout out what they'd like to see in a movie, write that all down, throw the ideas in the air, and put them all together and write a screenplay. Let's point out some of the stupidity in this movie:
1 - No respect for the military. Who were the people at the beginning? Stockade scrapings? All they did was argue and not pay one bit of attention to what they were doing. Why were they transporting the first zombie? How about a little air cover? Or blocking off the entire highway?2 - Stupid soldiers. Rather than escape by jumping right into THE RUNNING HUMVEE, they run into the desert. These are professionals?3 - So the bad guy wants a sample of zombie blood. Couldn't get any while the military was blocking off the entire city of Las Vegas?4 - Dropping parachutists right into the middle of a zombie mob? Really?5 - Ammunition. How much ammo did these people carry? HOW MUCH? They never ran out!6 - Bringing in two inexperienced people on such a dangerous mission? The safe cracker and the unnecessary only there for drama annoying daughter. Really? She should have been the first to get killed off.7 - The nuclear strike. OK, city gets blasted off the face of the earth. Why not do that right away, say right after they blocked it off? Also, why didn't any of the super zombies climb the wall? Smart enough to have sex, wear clothing, fall in love and use primitive weapons, but not smart enough to climb a frakking wall?8 - The super zombies. Sorry, a lame idea. Zombies already have the numbers, so why the hell do they need to be smart and see the above comment.9 - The safe. So the safe has an escape tunnel? How did they know about it since it seemed it went dark when the one character got locked in.10 - The stupidest part of the entire movie. After the nuclear strike, the one character WHO HAS BEEN BITTEN, escapes and WALKS through a post nuclear strike. No radiation to kill him? And he ends up on a private jet where he starts to change. So when this plane crashes, he won't burn with it?Just an incredibly stupid movie. Face it people, Snyder is a freaking hack. WB's put way too much trust in him. He's done one great movie, 300 (probably because Frank Miller was involved), two decent movies, Watchmen and Man of Steel (which had a ton of problems as well), one so-so movie BvS: Dawn of Justice, which came along way too early. All his fans screamed about Justice League. His four hour cut isn't that different from the released version other than superman in black (ridiculous since he's supposed to be Hope) and that overlong epilogue. The rest of his movies, Dawn of the Dead, this and especially Sucker Punch (I still want my money back for this) are trash. He's like a lesser version of Michael Bay. And please, stop whining about your other Superhero movies Zack, no one cares and they've seen through you.","1","mhorg2018"," When will people realize Snyder is overrated?

This is the worst movie ever and not to mention they ruined the zombie genre so effectively.

Instead they chose to walk in the woods with a zombie hulk chasing them. Wow hats off to the writers of the movie.Why did scott just readily accepted the offer of 50 million and didn't demanded more.Why ( a big why) did the boss remained quiet and didn't gave them safe's codes or told them about the booby traps.How were they so sure that the helicopter would still fly and didn't cared much about the weight of the money and the passengers.When the first girl died, why she didn't told her boyfriend about the traitor. There was plenty of time for her to spit it out and save many lives.How come no one said anything when they found out that there were many teams before them who just happened to die in the casino and near the safe. Any sane person would had got the hell out of there after learning that secret.Why on earth the boss's man ( with the queen's head) went outside the building and not on the roof to the helicopter.Why didn't the team had not one single silencer with them. It would be so easy to just kill the zombie tiger, the queen, the other alpha zombie in the beginning and get over with it. And that too without alerting anyone.

The credit sequence is the highlight of the movie!! What's the point of having a movie in Vegas if you do nothing with your setting and reduce it to crumbling soft focus background details. Oh but there is one scene with slot machines!! Literally a one minute scene when they are in a casino the rest they are in dark corridors or piles of rubble. Are we supposed to believe that zombies completely eradicated Vegas and reduced it to rubble. Literally looked like a meteor hit Vegas.My biggest problem are with the characters. There are way too many it reminded me a lot of suicide squad the way they introduced them in this montage. They literally hire one of the team members because he made a YouTube video shooting zombies.. like really.. aren't there some more soldiers you know? But seriously who cares who makes it out. And you made a 2.5 hour movie with a story that could have been told in 70min and couldn't figure out how to make us care about any of the characters.I could go on and on. I used to love zombie movies (original Dawn one of my favorite movies.. Zack remake was..) but they have been reduced to nothing more that pointless monster movies that are a shell of what they once were with absolutely nothing to say other than here's some gore!

But don't hate yourself for not having noticed all the goofs; it was a natural, self-defensive reaction of your brain to go into some kind of drowsy mode.Oh, the reason? Some of the reviews are hilarious, especially if you read them after watching the movie, not before.","3","mck-20739"," Why you should watch this movie

"168","I'm a big fan of zombie movies but this...this was bad. Where to start...The story...
Starting with the boss sending an awkward and unprepared team.The militar guys unable to follow direct orders. The only two survivors decide to walk away from the vehicle and off to the desert when there's a giant monster chasing them.The 'nerd guy' that has some kind of magical powers to open a super secluded vault in under 30min with just tapping his ear to the doir. He tries to be funny and you just want to punch him on the face.The vault is protected with traps that seriously reminds you to the beginning of the movie Indiana jones and the lost arc.There's some weird vampire vibes mixed with zombies.An extremely selfish daughter that puts everyone at risk to safe a woman, and at the end of the movie, at the scene of the helicopter, they don't bother to show us if she even survives.A kind of 'king' of zombies with her 'queen', having a random baby. Wth was that. Seriously.Oh, and the guy in the vault somehow surviving the radiation on ground zero, and not becoming a zombie for days or whatever took him to cross the desert??...The acting is not very impressive neither, but tbh they didn't have much to work with from the start.The script is really terrible. Everything is predictive and boring. This was such a waste of 2.5h...The music... completely random choice that seemed to be added just to fill the lack of everything else. The choice of classical music seemed to be more to avoid paying royalties than if it worked well or not with the movie.Seriously, what a waste.. not original, nor creative, nor entertaining.

"171","Did you know that dead is a synonym for boring?I do love me some zombies and had high hopes for this one like everyone, but they began evaporating with the Zombieland clone opening credits and deflated further with every cringe-worthy cover of a classic rock song and apparition of a woefully miscast actor (et tu, Notaro?), until after wincing and waiting for the movie to start gaining steam, it instead rolled itself backwards off a cliff into a flaming lake of stupid.I don't expect much from a Zack Snyder movie other than breathtaking visuals, which is fine. Sucker Punch and Justice League et al delivered the goods but there were no money shots here, just some goofy CGI and ho-hum action sequences, all dimly lit and shot with a zoom lens, cramping the scenes and blurring out the background, i.e. The zombie horde (the money shots).It's hard to believe this is the same director who did the great 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake. If only James Gunn had done the script for this one too! The writing is the real nail in the coffin here, with a plot so implausible that even an 8 year old would want to poke holes in it.The only thing truly dead here is any hope for the upcoming franchise, and also my behind from sitting through this 2 1/2 bore.","3","orangehenryviii"," Army of the Disappoint-Dead

"172","Everybody dies because Kate tries to save some person who isn't part of the movie.Kate doesn't get the money in the end either. She gets a ""small amount"" to get the kids out of the camp. THE CAMP THAT WAS JUST NUKED?! Did I misunderstand this or what?Kate survives a nuclear blast and seems fine after the chopper went down. And a US Air Force chopper comes to the rescue - wayyy too close to the nuclear blast. I'm pretty sure they would've died.Anyway. The movie focuses on Scott who tries to get this money for his daughter, but that doesn't go well. The money ends up with Van who spends it on a private plane ticket (why?) but he dies... Not from literally walking through the radiation zone hours after a nuclear blast, but from being bit by a zombie.Who wrote this? And who decided to fund the script? I have never given a movie a rating this low, because I feel bad if I do. People have put in so much work into this project so I don't want to slam it. But come on. This is not a zombie movie. It's a fantasy movie.On the other hand - I have some positive feedback too:1. Dave Bautista. I really like this actor and I loved him in Bushwick. Great and underrated movie. I think Dave is a very underrated actor who deserves much better scripts than Army of the Dead.2. CGI etc. This movie looks great. The zombies are pathetic (a king and a queen with super powers... lame) but special effects and stuff look great.3. The splatter stuff. I loved that. It was very well made and when the head of the ""queen"" falls to the ground in the end, I laughed because it looked great. SPLAT!","2","sr-w"," Dave Bautista deserves better movie scripts

They were fleshed out and that's what made them funny. You knew them after watching it, they didn't just say stupid lines for the sake of it, you felt like that was actually what them characters were like.I also loved its colours they were just so sweet and candy like.

Is the extended gabbling about anything that popped into their heads supposed to be funny because it's done with a nebraska accent? Again they seemed to think so. A tedious movie.

"200","As any SNL fan knows from the range of her sketches, when Kristen Wiig is on her game, she can be hilarious; other characters of hers can be pointlessly or excessively annoying. In this outing, she and co-star Annie Mumolo play the eponymous gal pals who seem destined to splurge on a big vacation. They lost their jobs and were ousted from their suburban social circle (a nicely satiric group of tea-sipping Karens' Talk Club) on the same day another friend gushes over her recent vacation to the titular Florida destination. And they're off.Unfortunately, their trip coincides with an over-the-top supervillain's elaborate revenge plot against that resort town. She is sort of a distaff Dr. Evil, whose pasty complexion makes Tilda Swinton look like a sun-baked beach bunny. That's not pale-shaming; it's key to the plot. Such as it is.Remember Romy and Michele's High School Reunion from 1997? Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino were a delight as ditzy innocents with a lifelong bond that synced their minds on a wavelength beyond most peoples' comprehension. This one plays as if those characters are back 20+ years later, having been drained of all their charm. Barb and Star work and live together, chatting incessantly over mostly meaningless minutia that has kept them on their own island of reality. Their characters grow tiresome long before they grow in their story arcs. The result is a tedious experience, relieved somewhat by a smattering of truly funny moments. Among those are a few clever songs (one going almost full Bollywood) and surprising, mostly uncredited, cameos from stars who must have assumed the final script would turn out much better than the working version they were sent.Barb and Star is mediocre fluff. Even so, for those who watch, here's a bonus tip. During one character's semi-romantic song on the beach, watch the shadows on the sand to see how many different times of day were involved in the filming of one sequence. It's something for the unengaged to do.","4","lotekguy-1"," Disappointing attempt at a coming-of-middle-age comedy

"201","On the morning November 26th, 2019, my parents found their son, and my youngest brother dead to his addiction to ""bliss.""To be clear; I didn't want to watch this film. I'm glad I did. My brother was an alcoholic and a drug addict for the better part of 13 years, starting not long after he graduated high school. He had long a beautiful seasons of sobriety during this time. But most of these years were ruled fraught with relapse, jail, court, broken hearts, and cautiously optimistic hope.In his last trip into the land of bliss, not long before his death, meth had truly taken him to different worlds, though I must say here that none of them struck me as anything more than a nightmare.I'm not sure that the world Jason sought looked like the one in this movie, but I know he first traveled there to escape the pain he felt deep inside. Loss of child hood friends, contemplating his own identity as an adopted son (With us from birth mind you), and the battle in his own mind as a baby carried to term by a drug addict herself.Along with my tribute, I'll add that I'm grateful to have seen a glimpse of what his world might have been like. It was terrible and helpful. This movie is unsettling every step of the way if you love someone who is or was battling an addiction. You'll probably only watch this once, or maybe never. But there is no doubting that it was a worthy venture to tell a difficult story that resembles the lives of those trapped by drugs and maybe even more importantly, us who live as ghosts in the lives of those we love. Sorry to anyone else who knows this pain.Love you. Miss you. D.","10","sxsxndnf"," RIP Jason K.

"202","I was really excited to watch this film. I love sci-fi and I'm a big fan of both actors. I was looking for something fun and quirky but that's not what it is. About 15-20 minutes into the film I had to adjust my expectations. I had to shift my thinking from sci-fi to drama because that's what it really is. *SPOILER*It's a drama about addiction. A lot of people probably didn't realize this because they've never had to deal with a loved one that has addiction issues. Unfortunately I have and I saw all the signs. I understand why the writer/director wanted to leave it up to interpretation but I think that just led to some confusion - especially for people who don't have any experience with an addiction. I also think there's a bit of mental illness in there as well and that fits because a lot of people with mental illness self medicate with illegal drugs.All of the haziness occurs when people are coming down off their high. During their highs everything is blissful - or so it seems. That's the only thing that could explain why people would hurt their families - especially their children - so much.I think it's a worthwhile movie with great acting. I think people will enjoy this more once they adjust their expectations.","8","sydnee_man"," The worst thing about this movie was the marketing.

"204","Greg is a drug- addicted man, and Isabel is his addiction enchantress.
If you follow the symbolism and metaphors, starting with the foreshadowing by the Drug Rehab center sign seen out of Greg's office window, you can get an enlightening idea of what it is like to be addicted to drugs and to be homeless. To me, Isabel is quite literally Addiction itself. As she appears dirtier and her hair more disheveled, he is becoming more addicted.This movie was eye-opening for me because I'd never before been able to understand that someone being ""blissed out of their mind"" could actually seem better to them than the real world around them. A drug high can seem like a utopia compared to everyday struggles, guilt, pressure, stress, and poverty. Escaping to that temporary place is a reprieve and I now better understand the allure and difficulty of breaking addiction. I've never felt this addiction but I feel like I can have better sympathy and understanding for those who have.","8","enchanteddaisy"," A beautifully enlightening story about drug addiction

The idea that they should inhale a magic crystal to transport to the real world back and forth, the ideal conditions of one world, the misery of the other, and the confusion between their worlds, plus the final solution of rehab gives a clue.
I don´t think this has anything to do with science fiction.

I really believe it's because of the lasting impression the marketing left on me.It took me just about past the midway point of the movie I started to realize it wasn't about Syfy at all. It's about drug addiction, the mentally disabled, and homelessness. The moment I recognized this, I had a better impression of the movie. Having a career in LE in a city I experienced many with those difficulties. It's easy to criticize the homeless or dismiss them, but if you had a better understanding of the issues they're having mentally your feelings would change.

"211","My husband and I sat down to watch this ""sci-fi"" movie and, for more than a few minutes, were blinking and what-ing until finally-FINALLY we got it.Our protagonist in one of the first scenes pops a few hydrocodones. Clue. His daughter is looking for him, his son seems angry and asks, ""What's it going to be this time? His shoulder? Leg? His back?"" Clue that went right over our heads.Selma shows up and it starts becoming clear. She represents, personifies, addiction. He meets her and goes off to bliss, but every time he comes back to reality it's darker and dirtier. Is it a simulation or stimulation brought on by these weird ""crystals""?Some unnecessary brain machine sequence threw us for a minute, but the clues are everywhere screaming the real point.This is a brilliant movie that I won't spoil anymore. It's so well done, so subtle but also is quite clearly telling us what happens when you chase, or try to, keep chasing the euphoria of that first drug-fueled bliss.I'm going to watch it again, now that I know what it's really about. One can be sitting in an alley, filthy...but the minute the drug hits the bloodstream everything is Utopia.Bravo filmmakers. Truly. Bravo!","9","DebraIonaVogel"," Just wait, you'll get it and it will be worth it!

"214","The way you react to this film depends on how you view two things: Drugs and Homelessness.The trailer is very misleading as you may accidentally mistaken it for a sci-if thriller. It's not a thriller and can be very disappointing when you go through the film at first. Whoever developed the trailer did not market it well and is very upsetting.
But if you sit back and experience it with no expectations, the film is actually very good.
Our two main talented actors do a really good job of portraying these unique character and really give you a sense of who they are and what they are experiencing.
As of the time of this review, the film was just recently released and already is having mixed reviews. It's a story inspired by real situations told in a unique and thought-provoking way.
Which is why it really depends on your thoughts and views on the real world issues this is based on. It may come across as controversial in some ways but speaks some truth that isn't spoken enough about in the mainstream.
The ending was super good and doesn't leave you upset or unsatisfied like some films like to do.
Very solid and deserves more credit.
Although, whoever was in charge of marketing did not do a good job.","8","dtrani"," Amazing film! Bad marketing.

"215","I watched this after watching the trailer, though the trailer seems to be for another film I was not disappointed. I watched this with the wife on valentine's Day, thinking it was a bit of a romantic film and we both seemed to actually enjoy it. The film never tells you what it's about, it makes you use your brain to think and talk about what is happening and what did happen. We both worked out what the underling story was but there are so many questions you think and rethink after the film's finished and that's what I love about this film, it's not easily forgotten but I do want to see it again. When I do I will probably see it from a different view and end up with a different score. Watch it and enjoy the ride which I will be as interesting as mine","8","goonerchris-161-428318"," Makes you think long after watching

"216","This movie, clearly based on drug addiction, takes an interesting take on the co-dependent/dependent relationship between two individuals suffering from addiction. Granted, things aren't exactly straight forward, and I would love to know what ""we're in a pickle"" looks like, but all in all I enjoyed it and me and my wife had a pretty straightforward understanding of it. To be clear, (spoiler) the addiction starts when he snorts the pain meds and his wallet begins to flicker. It was a rabbit hole from there on out. Are there unanswered questions...yeah. Does anyone have all the answers for drug addiction and mental health....nope, and that's where the film is set.","8","mhehvdmr"," An addiction haze

"217","Bliss is profoundly hitting home for me as a family member of loved ones with drug addiction, psychosis and schizophrenia. If you are trying to fit it in a matrix-style sci-fi box, you've missed the point. It's about the subjective experience of mental illness and the absolute reality split that is experienced by the person, while their loved ones desperately try to reach them. Its about the person giving their power away to another person, allowing their psychological boundaries to be crossed, because that sense of reality was extremely fragile to begin with. Both people can fuel and reaffirm each other's psychosis.I've see my loved ones in drug fuelled co-psychosis. I think that is what this film is portraying. This is a great film. Well done, to the writer and cast.","9","rebeccagraywithana"," Great film about drug psychosis.

"218","Bliss is not a sci-fi action movie, however it's a powerful story that tackles deep into drug addiction and mental illness. The theme of this movie goes deeper than what is visible at first glance- exploration of ""Platos's cave"" and ""Jacob's ladder"".
Greg's character, played by Owen Wilson is an example how easily one can fall out of society. It is definitely thought provoking.","10","Saltafilm2804"," A mind bending exploration of a drug addiction.

"219","This film has so many interesting ideas but i found that it doesn't really follow all of them though.I'm pretty confused at the low score and how badly it is being panned by critics.I thought the acting was pretty good and i was really interested in these characters. Which is where i think some of the issue are found.I think this film needed to take a step back from the sci-fi elements. They are very sparse but are there enough to hinder the true storyline. If i am being honest i think the whole 2nd act needed retooling. It was like a brick wall that the movie just slammed into. And then it just sort of slogged along. Once again i thought 'oh this is interesting' but then it just like stalled and i sat around thinking what is this movie now. It kind of gets its momentum back in the 3rd act but i think the 1st is where this movie shines.This movie is also great at visual storytelling. The production design, costuming and make up all work so well. It allows you to understand what the film is trying to say before the film explicitly tells you and i though that was really good.I honestly think this movie could have been great but it just got its self bogged down with the sci-fi part and trying to trick? the audience.I think it held its cards too close to its chest but i think the twist is blatantly clear from literally the first scene. This isn't a bad thing at all. I think it would have been better letting us view this world though the lens of us knowing twist from the beginning. I think that would have been a much more interesting and very eye opening character and subject study.","7","Golden_Hope"," Really Great Ideas With A Passing Execution.

"221","This movie gives a glimpse into the mental realm of an addict that rolls with the highs and lows of hallucinogens, opiates, stimulants, etc. I can't believe all the poor reviews. It makes me think that people can't think outside the box; that they were not able to make an accurate connection between the events in this movie and the altered mental status of a hardcore addict who suffers from cognitive distortion and other mental symptoms caused by excessive drug usage. This movie used symbolism in an ingenious way. If one analyzes this movie, one can see the correlation between the specific events and the effects certain drugs have on the mind and body. Those who gave negative reviews are probably interested in a movie that is black and white, not gray and abstract like Bliss. Kudos to the writers for such incredible creativity!!","10","ns26"," Wow.....Ingenious!!!

"222","I found this movie to be a really interesting and thought provoking take on what it might be like inside the world and head of the drug addict. As the mother of a grown adult who was, for a time teetering on death due to his addiction, and totally unreachable because of where he was, I wonder if his experience was similar to what this movie portrays. In the few professional reviews I read (none of them favorable) the fact that this movie was based around drug addiction and homelessness never even seemed to enter the equation. Huh??? Anyway, I thought it was really good and I enjoyed it for what it was. Great acting by Wilson and Hayek!","7","tk-dj"," Interesting...

"223","For me, bliss is a pleasant surprise. It tells a compelling and interesting story of a guy whos life goes down the drain in a visually unsusual and stunning way.It is not an action movie and it certainly is not science fiction. It is a drama which tells us so much about the life of people we try not to see on our streets and under bridges. And it makes it clear why it is so hard to reach people who have an addiction. Bliss is street slang for bath salts and bath salts describe over the counter powder drugs which give you halluzinations but also have terrible side effects, not only to your brain. The main protagonist, played by an excellent Owen Wilson, made the wrong decisions. He lost his wife, his family, his job and is now homeless and a drug addict.This movie is a work of art. Because it uses sounds, pictures and an excellent soundtrack to let you experience how an addict experiences his life. Beautifully done and therefore a pleasant surprise for me.","9","tandeki"," One gem of a movie!

Can you live in a world and be happy because you choose to? Are your problems real? Do you need to change, or does the world need to change for you? All of the themes in this movie are classic Science Fiction devises, used in literature and seeing a movie, not a short story, not a novel, give me the gut punching, thought provoking moment of contemplation was so wonderful. I can see how it's not to the masses tastes, you might have to think about it a bit, you might have to forgive it a bit on some technical issues, but variety is the spice of life.","9","tjmajor"," True SF in a world of mass market entertainment

"226","There are more levels of meaning to this film than may be obvious. With the number of highbrow story elements compressed into 100 mins (causality loops, DNA coded missing mass, Egyptian mythology and catastrophism) it would have been very easy to overwhelm and confuse the audience with too many ideas - but Boss Level doesn't. The story is well told, very well paced and seems to make a point of intentionally evolving from chaotic and complex to calm and clear. Clive Ventor's plan is horrific but logical and it's eventually revealed that Roy Pulver really only ever had one job from the start. When he devises his final, final, final, FINAL plan, despite everything that's happened, it makes perfect sense and also provides a valuable message about not giving up - even when you know the situation is completely hopeless.

"228","....a freakin' awesome movie is what I just watched.Give me some leeway here, as this is my first IMDB review. The way I judge a film is primarily is when I finish watching I ask myself ""Was I entertained enough to such that I would pay to see that again?"".While I admit openly that my threshold for entertainment is low, this one far exceeded that.I have seen Frank Grillo in a few movies, he seems like a bit of a B-Grade Action Movie Guy - boy was I wrong. My opinion has changed greatly such that I shall go seek out other Frank Grillo movies.As the main guy Boss Level, he delivered an outstanding performance. His blasé deadpan attitude was very funny - after all he is a guy who was just over it, starting each day, dying, rinse and repeat,There are some real parallels with Groundhog Day on the journey he takes - the ups and down, and how he games it to his advantage.Mel Gibson was ok, a typical Action Move Antagonist - some of the other quite unique characters maybe be somewhat clichéd, but still very funny.There are no Oscar's here, then again who cares about the Oscar's anymore? What I want is entertainment, and that is what I got, and then some.","9","rolytnz"," What Did I Just Watch?

"230","Never understood why some movie titles are so underrated.The movie is quick, with a video game culture in it, funny, with quantum-mechanics paradoxes, and somehow Grillo managed to support the whole project appropriately.Also Mel Gibson matured pretty well having some great lines in the movie regarding the horror of Violence and War (reminding Colonel Kurzt).9/10.

"232","I going to come clean and say I flat out loved this film. It has a great cast, script, action, direction and of course special effects. Equally important, the choreography in the fight scenes is excellent. I never thought I was being hoodwinked or short changed by careful cutting, rapid shot changes or careful camera placement.Although it has a pretty good if somewhat simplistic storyline, it has been adapted very imaginatively with what is actually quite a lot of forethought planning and development. I felt a little cheated with the ending but on retrospect, I couldn't really have asked for too much more... maybe they're doing a Boss Level II.Normally I expect Frank Grillo to be either a second tier good guy, when the likes of some A-lister is unavailable or possibly out of budget, or a first rate bad guy, a role he tends to somewhat excel in. Here he's the star attraction and with Naomi Watts and Mell Gibson bringing up the rear and it's a good combination.Grillo is sharp, witty, romantic and... well, displays a range as an actor that we rarely see him portray, and he does a great job. As an action actor there are few who can walk in his shoes, both physically and with his on screen presence, let's face it, he gets a lot of work in this area for a good reason, but I wasn't expecting him to be a lead in a role that really demands a lot more of his acting ability, and quite frankly, I'm pleasantly surprised. Not that I'm saying he couldn't act before, just that, well... I've not seen him in many parts where he's had much more to do than be/look hard, and or beat people up.Gibson is Gibson at this stage of his career, gritty, unhinged and accomplished.Watts is never truly convincing as a scientist/doctor/researcher. The rather alluring slinky dress that functions as a lab coat or some other type of boffin garb was ill thought out, but she nevertheless manages to deliver a competent performance whilst adding a sultry appeal that doesn't go unmissed... perhaps the dress isn't such a bad idea after all.The minor cast is for the most part an accomplished line up of add-ins who do a pretty good job in filling in the necessary spaces for villain-hood, goonish ineptitude and thuggery. Some are quite enthralling and I loved the way that a multitude of baddies are employed for skulduggery, even if it is (given the protagonist and his lack of superpowers) somewhat excessive. Whilst Michelle yeo is largely unused, she nevertheless gives the story some credibility.Anyway, I won't give away any details on the plot but it is a good film with a pretty solid delivery all round. I'm not going to nit-pick on the fine points of the story or temporal mechanics of the notions therein, and even though I do like the fact they didn't try and explain away some aspect of science, I didn't so much like that a fair amount of meat was left off the bones of the science aspect of the film... not that it mattered much since it wasn't really the focal point of the film... well, not really.Anyway, go see it. Solid 7.5 out of 10 for me but I'll give it an 8 since it was an unexpected pleasure to watch.","8","Jim_Screechy"," Very Good action flick
"
"233","Frank Grillo at his best, supported by a good cast and a cool script. The one-liners are a highlight in this film, as they give away the smart, fast-paced story and the swag of Grillo as an action lead actor. The action starts right away; this is not a boring movie by any means. Can't say much about the plot as this might be a spoiler but if you like action/comedy/sci-fi with a big splash of coolness, then that's your jam! 9/10 for the fun!","9","ThomDerd"," Yesss that's a fun movie!

"235","This movie trailer gives you the impression that you don't need to watch it as you've already seen the good bits. It makes you expect nothing but still look forward to a descent action flick; the good news are that you're wrong, the best is yet to come.
The first impression as the movie starts is that the movie has its own pace, and a great one. That's the same director of Smoking Aces, and you can see a lot of his dynamics playing out perfectly on this movie.
The big surprise comes with the main character's arch. The story is good enough, but the journey the protagonist has to go through in order to see the next day is a game changer, satisfying, it pays off.
The movie is not perfect and that's all right. We can't expect a film to meet everyone's expectations. Those guys did their best and at the end of the day, they achieved it.
I'm one of those people who doesn't get impressed easily, I hate CGI and think that most movie makers these days don't have the balls to make characters with unique, even flawed attributes that go against the Hollywood stereotype.
It ain't the best CGI I've ever seen but I was too busy having fun to judge how well made it was.

"239","WHOA!!! This movie totally knocked my socks off. I was expecting a B maybe even a C level movie but boy was I wrong! BooM... John Wick meets Groundhog Day!The movie starts off with a an assassin trying to kill Frank Grillo's character Roy Pulver and never lets up on the action. When it does ease up you have some quirky comedy met with some touching father & son moments. Very interesting that Franks Grillo's real son played his on screen son Joe, this explains their natural chemistry. Some of my favorite moments are of the swords-woman Guan Yin and every time she kills Frank Grillo says, ""This is Guan Yin and Guan Yin has done this!"" So it's hilarious and satisfying when Frank Grillo's character Roy kills Guan Yin and says, ""This is Roy and Roy has done this!"" Such brilliance.I never really appreciated a Frank Grillo until now. I remember watching a Purge movie with him but nothing super memorable came from it, but this movie really showcases his talents in the most superb way. I think the guy is in his 50's and he's rocking a perfect in shape body and looks healthier than most 20 year olds. I'm left with wanting more of this awesome action star.Oh yeah and the movie also showcases some heavy hitters like Mel Gibson and Naomi Watts who do a great job as well.

______________________________________________________
Right, So, ...Hypothetically... If you had queried me, about halfway through this picture, from one of the two "" Pandemically-Correct ð ✅ "" do-not-sit cinema seats beside me, as to how I thought this thoroughly 'relentless' movie's narrative arc might progress, or even culminate, I wouldn't have been able to answer correctly, 'to save my life'. And when it comes to movies & me .....that is -Most- definitely a "" Very, Very, Very Good "" Thing. Why❔because I'm an -Absolute- Stickler❗for films that ~{ End }~ up, when all is said & done, being, shall we say, ~{ "" Wonderfully "" }~ Unpredictable -DESPITE- the marked presence, within said film, of a seemingly obvious predilection towards a predetermined outcome .
However, even -{ Having }- said that... In Truth ...it took -A Good While- for the film to -Actually- start to grow on me. Let me 'Attempt' to describe whatever it was that ~{ Genuinely }~ surprised me in the case of -THIS- particular 'High Octane Big Action Blockbuster' flick , ( as follows ) . Well, so..... ð{ On-The-One-Hand }ð, the ~{ Fact }~ is, that this film felt : -Not Only- a little annoying & 'repetitive, as well as "" straight up gruesome to the point of being almost outright "" Macabre "" ; but -Also- rather 'Crass', Stereotypical, & chock full of standard, 'Run-of-the-mill' popcorn-flick clichés .....{ for what seemed like the ( -Entire- ) first quarter of its 01:45:00 run time }. Not to mention the decidedly ""Glaring"" fact that a movie utterly ~{ REPLETE }~ with all manner of Gaming-References ( including a few rather sweetly-Nostalgic 'Analog Type' ones ), is in effect... ~{ "" Phenomenally "" }~ ...inappropriate ⛔ for children of -Any- age, on account of the gore & language in the film, -Alone- ( ...& that's a bit tragic, really, come to think of it... ) .
But ð{ On-The-Other-Hand }ð though, when some loose ends ""Very Gradually"" start to be squared away & a few critical backstories begin to come to light ; ~{ EVEN }~ leading man Frank Grillo's potentially irksome, somewhat nasal, 'N.Y.C-By-Way-Of-Calabria', ( & profanity -""Saturated""- ), drawl... thankfully ...does -Not- stand in the way of bringing that real ""Thrill-Factor"" ( ð ð¥ ) into the house, & with ""Full Effect"", at that. So, in retrospect, I'm going to attribute this to the delightful ability of Director Joe Carnahan -( 2010's 'The A-Team' Remake )- to interweave 'A Little Heart And Soul' into his films, ~{ Irrespective }~ of how Chaotic, Irreverent & indeed, even outright "" FRENETIC "" the unfolding action in the picture might prove to be. An often subtle... yet ultimately "" Tremendous "" ...Performance from the ""ever-Resplendentð"" Naomi Watts ( 'Jemma Wells' - Roy's ex-wife in the story ) is a huge & 'obvious' Boost to the entire paradigm ; while the -Biological- son that she & Roy Pulver share in the film, 'Joe Wells' ...{ get this : played by none other than Frank Grillo's ~{ Real Life ð¦❗}~ child Rio }... brings a "" Vividly Radiant "" Cuteness & Innocence to the fray, -Significantly- lightening up what would otherwise ~{ Just }~ be fairly crude, bloody & -( Unquestionably )- less appealing cinematic fare .

"246","I love time movies. Groundhog day being one of my favorites.
This isn't it, of course, but it is very well written and executed. I'm beyond surprised and my expectations were more than met. Dialogues, execution, sentimental value, characters and action scenes. There is nothing I hated, and more importantly, nothing I would change. I would even watch this again sometime in the future! And this a very big ask for a movie.It's funny. This seemed like a cheap indie movie, but the script is so well planned. A yarn that unwraps in the best possible way..... You, whoever you are, can probably tell I'm still excited.
I would recommend this to anyone that like a good action movie with a bit of sci-fi in it. Has a dash of ""No More Heroes"" the game (the first one, of course), and a tad of Deadpool (the good parts).

"249","Do not get deceived by first appearances. Yes, it's a small movie, it stars Frank Grillo, who had to act in some pretty shoddy films in order to get ahead and it's not something for the Oscars, but it is a perfect little film for what it wants to do. The plot is simple: infinite time loop, second movie like that I've seen in two days. But instead of having the hero moan about the boredom of having infinite time, which always annoys the hell out of me, it starts with people wanting to kill him. All top assassins, finding him wherever he runs. And if he dies, he starts over, if he does not, his wife dies, then his son, then the world ends.If I had to compare it with an existing film, I would rather compare it to Hardcore Henry than to other time loop films. Yet that film was an experiment in video game cinematics, while this is a decent sci-fi story: a good ole what-if, with some action sprinkled for fun. So congratulations to Joe Carnahan and to Frank Grillo, because they made one of those gems in the mud that people talk about. And yes, Mel Gibson is a secondary character at best, but so is Michelle Yeoh, and both are perfect for their roles and they clearly have fun with them.Bottom line: watch it, you won't be disappointed.P.S. Is Naomi Watts annoying in real life, too? I mean, all her characters are awful. In this one she admits she didn't know whether her plan would work, you know, the one where she kills her husband over and over and over again, then the world ends.","9","siderite"," Excellent and concise, it is a proper sci-fi story, with some decent action

"250","Aaaaaamazing WOW! Best movie I've seen this year! This role was MADE for Frank Grillo who simply nailed it! The genre for this film is ""Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller"" but also needs ""Comedy"" added because Grillo made us laugh throughout his entire performances, especially during his commentating dialogue. The entire casting and performances were spot on. Writer, producer and director Joe Carnahan was genius with his screenplay, although I'm sure some critics will slam this film as a Ground Hog Day knockoff. But considering every type of story these days isn't original, Carnahan managed to make this one unique and as far as I'm concerned, less monotonous and much more fun than Ground Hog Day. The 100 min runtime was just right as was the pacing. Carnahan's directing was excellent as was the cinematography. The score was perfect and the soundtrack amazing!

"251","I will not attempt to describe this movie. It would be fruitless. You may at first be frustrated by the seemingly inept invocation of all the tried and true cliches of the ""genre"" - from Mad Max to its weirder post-apocalyptic cousins. But this is not Circuitry Man in reverse - it is much, much stranger. By the time the polka-dotted bikini-wearing ex-girlfriend of the hero is playing hostess at the disney-esque bubble-dome camp of the desert-dwelling homicidal outlaw gang... oh, never mind. By the way, Melanie Griffith was much better looking before lip surgery. Almost hot, in fact. But rest assured, this is a work of genius, exposing a deep understanding of the rift between genders during the height of the supposedly post-sexual-liberation 1980's, an almost sublime sense of humor about sexual alienation and most of all, the erotic link between women and cars in American culture is finally completely laid bare.In fact, this movie is so profoundly subversive that it could only be made under cover of shlock. Do not be fooled by what seems like coke-addled acting and tourette-syndrome editing. This film is high art. Especially the part where the robot says ""is that your hand?""

"252","Cherry 2k is a low budget one-off adaptation of the Mad Max concept mixed in with futurist technology ideas and a very cool love story. The male star goes on a quest to replace his lost robot sex android. That's the basic plot.What's unusual is that this movie succeeds in mixing these elements without screwing up. The Sci-fi perspective doesn't overwhelm the overall plot, and vice versa.Very few B grade movies from this time period were watchable, much less worth keeping in one's collection.

"253","""Cherry 2000"" was a huge commercial failure and it's hardly ever mentioned today, but I found it surprisingly entertaining. Sure, the script is unimaginative and the film has no real vision and the action scenes are strictly routine, but the two leads are enormously, effortlessly likable. They make a deeply sweet pair. Maybe the film should have concentrated more on their love story and less on the familiar action aspects of the story. And the violence of a couple of scenes seems rather out of place. But even with its weaknesses, this movie is, fitfully, absorbing and very entertaining.","7","gridoon"," Some dull parts, but still an effortlessly likable movie.

"254","Okay, ""Cherry 2000"" has finally achieved ""cult film"" status. But unlike many other cult movies, it actually deserves the title.There are many things to like about this flick. The nuanced, likeable Ben Johnson has a good role that even delivers some tragedy (how often do you get that in a b-movie?). The charismatic Griffith is alternately contemplative and kick-ass. Of course, Tim Thomerson as Lester nearly steals the show, providing a truly strange, ruthless villain.The effects are cheesy, sure, but they never look fake, unlike a lot of the CGI films coming out today. When you see E. Johnson's Ford being dangled over the Hoover Dam, that is an ACTUAL car, not some stupid digital effect.The movie does lay its message on thick, but considering the obvious budget constraints they were working with, that's a perfectly excuseable flaw. The satire is at times hilarious (watch for Larry Fishburne's turn as a lawyer with Morpheus-esque reflecting sunglasses, and the final exit of the villain is truly visually ironic).

"258","Imagination.. Heart..Very few sci-fi's have this much heart and this much story packed into a beautiful movie.. So how can I describe Cherry?Cherry starts out like every good story and builds up to it, by first establishing the universe.. a post-apocalyptic world (or sum such) where recycling is important, new fashions are in play and sex robots are possible and people (at least from the characters point of view) have to have contracts to date/copulateCherry then shows us one of the first *real* female action hero's (basically Tomb Raiders Laura Croft v1.0) and some great desert and action sequences that are widely unpredictable and done wellAll the while this stories carries on with credibility and imagination, Cherry 2000 is one of the most successful B movie sci-fi's ever accomplished it's these kinds of movies that give me hope to see more.. I personally love and still love a lot of 80's movies and 80's style we have yet to recapture in our let's make it all more real setting.. I'm not saying that gems aren't still made today they are; they've just been rarer to find as of late..Since Cherry is a special vein of movies all its own it's important we list e'm - Mad Max - The Road Warrior (this one is very special) - Dead-End Drive In What I can say about Cherry after multiple viewing maybe 5-7 now in my lifetime since I first caught in cinemax or one of the movie channels one night.. is that's its very, very special.. That the story is so good that it can play catch-up or compliment movies like ""A.I."" another one of Kubrick's unfigured out masterpieces..Normally I would say this movie is 7/10 but I'm upping my vote to 8/10 for now do to shear appreciation of this movie vs. some of the crap we have been getting these past 2 decades.. (note of course sci-fi had a great few years from about 1997 to 2001)On my last viewing this time I noticed again how good Basil Poledouris score compliments the movie..

"259","This little-known, under-rated, obscure little film packs a lot of entertainment value.A 1987 production, directed by Steve De Jarnatt, and starring Melanie Griffith, David Andrews, and Pamela Gidley, ""Cherry 2000"" goes highly unnoticed and unsung in the sci/fi field. However; I cannot say why, as this movie is extremely well written and extraordinarily entertaining.When Sam Treadwell's robotic companion breaks down, he goes in search of an exact duplicate in which to install her memory chip, and continue his life.

"262","Cherry 2000 was interesting for many reasons, not least for the unusual location for part of it. The name Sky Ranch was used, and this represents a place that actually exists. The headquarters of the bad guys, which was called Sky Ranch in the film, was actually what remained of Ash Meadows Sky Ranch, a permanently closed Nevada brothel. Until it closed in 1973 or 1974, Ash Meadows was considered one of the best of Nevada's legal brothels. The closest town was Death Valley Junction, which is in California. A dirt and gravel road was all there was to connect to Ash Meadows, and a billboard marked the turn, advertising free coffee.The brothel itself featured a small motel, a pool (seen in the movie), a 9-hole golf course, and an air strip, which might still appear on civilian aviation charts.Some time after the brothel closed, the State of Nevada made it a landmark of some sort, and I believe it takes special permission to enter.If not for Cherry 2000, I would never have been able to see this place.

"264","I've always been a really hardcore sci-fi/fantasy fan, so of course, I did really enjoy Cherry 2000. David Andrews and Melanie Griffith had great chemistry together, and this pre-Data android: Cherry 2000 (albeit an intelligent sex toy), gave the plot an amusing and very human twist. Basically, when Sam Treadwell's (Andrews) robotic playmate/best/only female friend 'dies', he desperately needs a replacement. An exact replacement. He braves the wilds out in the desert to reclaim his lost love. How will he find his dream girl? (Spoiler!) By finding another one! Sam hires a Tracker, Edith Johnson, also known as ""E."". E is a sexy, capable, hard woman (Griffith). Although E is the antithesis of everything Sam held dear, he finds love eventually....just not in the arms he expected. A classic love story with a futuristic twist, this isn't exactly fodder for an academy award, however, the acting was decent, the story was well written, and overall the experience stays with you. (These are pretty much the things I look out for when I'm rating a movie). Since most of the story is set a world very reminiscent of Mad Max and Waterworld, fans of the post-apocalyptic type of fantasy should really enjoy this movie. Heck, give it a chance. I'd rate it as being about 2 points above Waterworld on a scale of 1-10. The effects were remarkably good for it's time. Not much (if anything actually....) was fake or CG'ed. Even though the story is set in 2007, most people I know are able to make the leap to suspend their disbelief and enjoy this ride. Give this one a try, if you like sci-fi!Fans of less subtle movies, true dramas, regular romances will probably dislike this movie. Either they won't get the subtle jabs at society and the human condition or they won't enjoy the setting. Overly analytical, philosophical types probably won't enjoy this film either. It does take a long time to get the main point across.","7","MrcnBty"," Pretty decent time waster...

"265","This movie is one I ALMOST skipped entirely because in my mind 5.3 is an abysmal score to give ANY movie. I once saw Talledega Nights with a girl I was very much in love with-it was a time when NO good movies were being released and Snakes on a Plane was out at the same time so those were our choices. Let me tell you that Talledega Nights was the worse movie I ever paid for and had to suffer through. Terrible film. But the reason why I bring it up is that a piece of junk movie like that was still well received by a few airheads and they thought it was funny- the girl i liked being one of the few airheads who liked it. That movie scores higher on IMDb than this movie does and that is a down right shame because I would give TN a 1 out of 10 or 4 out of 10 if I were being more fair, but I would give THIS move Cherry 2000 a 7 out of 10 at least. What does this all prove? That movie ratings can sometimes be misleading. That someone can tell you a movie is awful and you would find that same movie great, and vice versa. So what this ultimately means then is that you have to watch this movie yourself and come to your own conclusion. As for myself I was pleasantly surprised. I had low expectations and found this entertaining enough and it moved right along smoothly. The movie has a good pace.","9","andressolf"," IMDb's rating is too low for this movie.

This is grade-c stuff, but somehow whenever I see it on the tube I pause for a while and check it out. Despite flopping when released, this movie has taken on a formidable cult status since.

"270","Filmed in 1985, but shelved and not released on VHS until 1987, perhaps the most telling thing about Cherry 2000, is that it's producer, Edward R. Pressman, reportedly confessed that the films distributors, Orion Pictures, were ""stumped"" by the films confusion of genres, which led to the long delay in it's initial release.Seeing it for the first time, it's easy to see why it was such a marketing headache. For starters, it isn't really any good, however, in being a crazy mish-mash of bits of everything, and having the good sense to never take itself too seriously, it's hard to feel annoyed with it.The film is set in the year 2020. Mankind has progressed to the extent that it's now possible to own a fully functional, supermodel, stay at home girlfriend (Cherry) who knows exactly how to treat her man – we never see male model counterparts. In the first scene, our lead character, Sam Tredwell, ( David Andrews) has a soapy, after dinner mishap with his own Cherry 2000 doll, which kick-starts the plot of him having to travel the wastelands of 'Zone 7′, to find another one. Yes folks, it's as ridiculous as it sounds. Co-starring with Andrews is a jaunty looking Melanie Griffith, who seems to be playing a female 'Rambo', running and gunning her way through her scenes. Surprisingly, some of the stunt work, locations and set pieces are genuinely quite stunning, which makes it all the more a shame that the end result is such an elaborate mess.Cherry 2000 is like Mad Max, but madder. It doesn't really seem to know what it wants to be, and ends up being not much of anything.

Granted it can only make you a burger and fries for dinner, but that is more than most women know how to do these days anyway. They could probably make a male version for females, but their heads would probably explode because no matter how hard you try to program it to act perfectly, it will still somehow set a woman off by making her mad, or by making her cry the robot would then just short circuit because no matter what it tries it fails. Yes, this is going to get me into a lot of trouble if my girlfriend ever reads this, but my sense of humor is very strange and I am getting a good chuckle. Well on to the rest of the movie. Man and his robot chick start having sex and water gets into the droid and it short circuits. Kind of a flaw right there as you would think they could make these things waterproof. Well he finds out it is impossible to fix and the dealer tries to sell him a newer model, but our hero will not have none of that as he is sort of in love with his bot and so off he goes to a bizarre forbidden zone to find another Cherry 2000 (the name of the particular model of bot he covets). He gets some help from a very attractive Melanie Griffon character and there is a cool scene with a car and a tunnel of water and then our hero gets captured by this weird group in the desert/forbidden zone place. He gets help from a lady he knows, but the main guy in this place is a tad insane, though actually somewhat friendly too.

"274","Cherry 2000 is a nifty B movie that takes place in a not too distant future where some unexplained apocalypse has occurred and made items that were once plentiful scarce.

It's no wonder then that our protagonist Sam prefers to stay at home with his sexbot, a vintage Cherry 2000 model who is essentially a traditional subservient housewife. Unfortunately, during a frothy romp in front of the dishwasher his Cherry malfunctions, leaving him no alternative but to hire a guide to take him to the dangerous zone to find a replacement model at the robot junkyard.

The strange thing about Sam is he is attracted to robots. Not only Cherry but his ex wife Ginger is as well, I should say, there is a lot of cheesy humor in the movie, but that is to be expected with Tim Thomerson ( Lester) in the movie. But beyond the humor is a underlining message about growing up and acting like an adult or living your life like a man-child. Sam at the end was given that choice, does he want to continue with a robot who can fulfill his every desire and loves you because she is programmed to do so, or should he choose a real woman ( E) who loves him for who he is and can make your life better? Spoilers ahead: He does the right thing and chooses E ( much to her surprise). Will E be easy, like a robot?

"278","The first time I saw ""Cherry 2000"", I saw it on the Los Angeles area ""Z"" Channel and if I remember correctly when they showed this film, it was not scheduled for theatrical release. I think they were showing movies of Melanie Griffith because ""Working Girl"" had become so popular at the time, and they were showing what a range this actress had from action-adventure to abused secretary. And Melanie Griffith does have that range.Cherry 2000 didn't look finished when I saw it, but what I loved about ti was it's story. I've all but forgotten about it until recently when one of the premiere movie channels showed it. In looking at it now, it could easily be renamed ""The Real Desperate Housewives of Orange County"" - this film was really perceptive for 1987 - and it's only 20 years later! There is a running joke in the film that makes me review Cherry 2000 this way - back then, I didn't catch it. Today, it's really funny.The joke: They ask the man looking to replace his robot where is he from? He replies: Anaheim. That's in Orange County. Why is it a joke? Well...Cherry 2000 was a female robot that was made as a companion for men. She was blonde, pretty, perfect breasts, perfect hips, very attentive to her man, had an A.I. chip of all the right things to say, all the right things to do.Cherry 2000 was perfect for coming home to when he had such a long day at work. This man was used to his Cherry 2000 and his A.I. Cherry 2000 program that was programmed to look, sound and do whatever he wanted. Unfortunately, Cherry 2000 short circuited and he needed to get a new one. In trying to replace his Cherry 2000, he found that it was obsolete. The body, but not the chip. Newer models of female robots were available but he was really into his Cherry 2000 (Another running joke is the line: ""Ah, yes, a Cherry 2000! Great hip action!"") so it was suggested that there might be a Cherry 2000 model out in the wastelands of robots. He could take his pre programmed chip and insert it into one of those Cherry's. Only way to get there was to find a 'tracker' to take him in to the Wasteland and get one.The only sane and semi-honest tracker he could find was a woman - gasp - a real woman, Played by Melanie Griffith. Melanie was skilled, tough and also...feminine. So, this man had to go into dangerous robotic wasteland territory with a real flesh and blood woman to find a Cherry 2000 robot that he thought was the only woman that could make him happy.As I pointed out, the story was a good story, the acting was fine, the production and post production values were light which took away from a lot for me as I watched it. It was kinda on the ""Mad Max"" level of production but for this story it needed more production values to succeed.It is a cautionary tale - and it looks as though it was perceptive. We are there, especially in Orange County with the pre-fabricated, programmed woman. This is not a ""Stepford Wife"", per ce. But it is an ideal and a manipulation of what some men think a woman should be, say and do all by the flick of a control - easy to control as flipping on a light switch. That is, until - you re-insert yourself among real humans, real women, non altered flesh and blood and find out what you're really missing, which our male does.A funny, nice, low-key production, cautionary tale, action, love story film.","5","lambiepie-2"," ""The Real Desperate Housewives of Orange County""

But in Cherry 2000 the bands of outlaws in the desert look more like Young Republicans than punk rockers and they prefer to have cook outs. This parody of Mad Max type movies is a fun way to spend an evening in front of the tv. Melanie Griffith is great as E Johnson, a tracker hired to find a memory chip for a robot.

In 1987, both of this movie's main future premises  that autonomous, artificially intelligent robotic ""perfect companions"" would exist as consumer products by about 2000, and that America would suffer a partial political collapse in the same decade  were not particularly outlandish.While Cherry 2000 is presently achieving cult film status, it was originally received as a much more conventional SF movie.","8","craig.duncan"," The perspective of someone who saw this movie in 1988

"282","A road-movie and science-fiction film, which has become a cult film, that is funny and entertaining despite the downs.The film has a great inventive and a good premise, and the characters are, a priori, quite attractive. However, the script is badly developed, the acting is pedestrian, and the special effects are very cheap, so you end laughing at he result, not getting engaged by a futuristic story. In other words this looks like a spoof movie, instead of a sci-fic one, which is what pretends to be. If the movie had been presented as a comedy, and not taken itself not so seriously, I would certainly have rated the film higher, as I laughed more than with many comedies.The cast counts with a very young Melanie Griffith in the role of the naive but daring E. Johnson, and with David Andrews as the sexy-hero Indiana-Jones of the future Sam Treadwell, who don't seem to have any chemistry on camera and do not shine in their performances. However, I found Pamela Gidley good and believable as robot Cherry 2000, and Jeniffer Mayo deadpan hilarious as Ronda.Sometimes we need to eat a gourmet dish and others we fancy a burger.

"283","""Cherry 2000"" is a sort of post-apocalyptic science fiction Western, a cross between ""Mad Max"" and ""The Stepford Wives"". The year is 2017, thirty years in the future when the film was made in 1987. Following some unspecified apocalypse America is divided into at least two parts. In the big cities civilisation goes on much as before. The deserts of the American West, however, have become a lawless wilderness, dominated by violent gangs, similar to those in the ""Mad Max"" films, who roam the desert in cars or on motorbikes.The film does not dwell much on futuristic technology, with one exception. The central premise of the film is that, before the apocalypse, science managed to perfect humanoid robots. The main character is a young man named Sam Treadwell who owns a ""Stepford Wives"" type female robot who acts as his housekeeper and sexual partner. As these robots are programmed to have warm and affectionate personalities and never have a headache at bedtime Sam is very happy with this arrangement, until his beloved short circuits during a love-making session on his kitchen floor. This presents Sam with a problem. His lady-friend was an obsolete model, the ""Cherry 2000"", no longer being manufactured, but he knows he will not be happy with a more modern replacement. (If the number 2000 was supposed to indicate the year in which Cherry was first manufactured, this is yet another in the long list of sci-fi predictions which have proved sadly premature- human colonies on Mars by 1987, and all that sort of thing).Sam discovers that there is a supply of Cherry 2000s in an abandoned warehouse, and decides to recover one and install the previous model's memory chip. There is, however, one further problem to be overcome. The warehouse is situated in the now lawless desert, beyond the pale of civilisation. He therefore enlists the help if Edith ""E"" Johnson, a ""tracker"" who makes a living through guiding people through the wasteland, but in order to reach the warehouse they have to avoid the attentions of Lester, the leaders of the gangsters who now control the desert. Sam also runs into his former girlfriend Elaine, now Lester's mistress, and the sort of neurotic, foul-tempered woman who could drive any man into the arms of a robotic substitute.The film is intended to be an action-adventure story, but it suffers from one fatal weakness; it stars Melanie Griffith. By playing a tough, sassy character Melanie was obviously hoping to get away from her bimbo image, but the inconvenient truth is that most of her best performances have come in films where she either plays a straightforward bimbo (as in ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"") or a bimbo with hidden depths (as in ""Working Girl"" or ""Born Yesterday""). Here as Edith she seems hopelessly miscast. Her normal blonde locks are hidden beneath a lurid red wig, making her look like the second cousin to a Belisha beacon, but she makes no attempt to disguise her high pitched, breathy, little-girl voice, hilariously inappropriate on the lips of a tough action heroine. She would probably have been better playing the robot Cherry, the girl with the artificial, carefully manufactured bimbo personality.There is occasionally some sharp dialogue; I liked, for example, the exchange when Elaine, told by Sam that her new boyfriend Lester is a psychopathic killer, snaps back ""Don't impose your values on me, Sam"". (This does not, however, imply that Elaine is deeply in love with Lester; her only reaction to his death is ""Well, no sandwiches for him""). The action sequences are not badly done, but as I pointed out when reviewing the original ""Mad Max"" there should be more to a film than the quality of its car crashes. None of the actors make much impression, other than Griffith who makes an impression for all the wrong reasons. Overall, ""Cherry 2000"" is a rather dull bit of eighties sci-fi marred by miscasting. It is sometimes described as a ""cult film"", but cults, whether cinematic or religious, are often mystifying to those who are not already True Believers. 4/10","4","JamesHitchcock"," Second Cousin to a Belisha Beacon

"284","I watch a lot of 'so-bad-they're-good' films, but 'Cherry 2000' was actually quite different. It was a 'so-bad-I-don't-know-if-it's-real' kind of film. I literally sat there unable to believe my eyes at what I was witnessing. It's set in some sort of weird future where men can buy robots shaped like beautiful women who will wait on their every needs. However, what one such man obviously never read in his 'wife's' instruction manual was that you should probably never get them wet.I won't go into the hows and whys of how he gets his 'Cherry 2000' model wet (there's a treat in store for you), but it totally blows a fuse and the local dealer seems to be out of stock in that particular make. Therefore, the only thing he can do is set out into a forbidden wasteland where there's – apparently – a robot graveyard full of perfectly-kept Cherrys waiting to be taken back to some lucky man's kitchen.So he does. Only he doesn't do it alone. He enlists the help of a 'tracker' – someone who's familiar with the dangerous world they're about to explore. This particular tracker is played by Melanie Griffith. And this is where the 'fun' starts. That is if you call 'fun' really bad acting. Melanie Griffith can't act. Or, to be fair, she can't act back in this particular film. I read online that she had just given birth weeks before filming, so perhaps I should cut her a bit of slack. But she really is bad. Every line is delivered like she's reading if from a children's comic (and not a very well-written comic either).You could almost say that she ruins the movie, but that would be a little unfair. The guy who's hired her tries to 'out-ruin' the movie, too. He's possibly the least charismatic leading man ever. Plus he doesn't seem able to close his mouth – ever. Therefore, with two such awful leads, you could imagine many people would have turned it off as soon as possible. But that's where its appeal lies – you have to watch it to see just how bad it gets.Plus there's the script itself. Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino would struggle to act well delivering these lines. It's like the writers were students who had a good idea for a film, but none of the talent to bring it to the big screen. The action scenes don't make sense. The dialogue doesn't make sense. The progression of the story from scene to scene doesn't make sense and, finally, the character motivation doesn't make sense either.Cherry 2000 is a disaster, but one of those car crash type disasters that you just have to watch. You need to know you are in for a bad experience when you sit down to watch this. It is bad, but it is so bad you really do have to see it to believe it.","6","bowmanblue"," It has to be seen to be believed

"285","Sure it's all too obviously influenced by ""Mad Max"" and ""The Road Warrior"", but it's still consistently engaging entertainment for cult film enthusiasts. Credit has to go to production designer John Jay Moore and cinematographer Jacques Haitkin for giving it just the right slightly futuristic look, and it's got some gorgeous rural vistas to take in. It's a little episodic, but it's also got some energy, and some nifty moments.Melanie Griffith offers a delightful performance as female ""tracker"" E. Johnson (the E stands for Edith), hired by lonely man Sam Treadwell (a fairly stiff David Andrews) to take him to a dangerous area where he can find a replacement for his robot wife Cherry (Pamela Gidley). On their journey they run into colourful characters played by such wonderful acting veterans as Ben Johnson, who's endearing as Six Fingered Jake, and Harry Carey Jr., as Snappy Tom.You know you'll be in for a good time when you look over that supporting cast: Marshall Bell, Laurence Fishburne, Michael C. Gwynne, Brion James, Jack Thibeau, and Robert Z'Dar. The always welcome Tim Thomerson has a particularly amusing role as an unconventional desert dwelling despot, whose followers have it in for people such as Edith. Overall the movie isn't overly flashy, but it's pretty exciting at times, especially the entire sequence with the crane and the water pipe. The soaring score composed by Basil Poledouris (""Conan the Barbarian"", ""RoboCop"", etc.) is fine accompaniment.Although Thomerson as Lester shows himself to be a serious psycho, this never gets too, too unpleasant, with director Steve De Jarnatt keeping the action moving and having fun with the offbeat little details provided by screenwriter Michael Almereyda (story credit goes to executive producer Lloyd Fonvielle). ""Cherry 2000"" does know how to send you away with a smile on your face. It may have gotten a limited release in theatres in the 1980s, but 26 years later it proves enjoyable enough to deserve a rediscovery.Seven out of 10.","7","Hey_Sweden"," Take note of this one, B movie lovers.

Griffith proves she's as versatile as a wet cloth, but its not about her or the dad from Terminator 3, with these apocalyptic movies, its the wealth of bizarre support that the ill has to offer.From Brion James, right up to a film stealing Tim Thomerson, its a film that's not going to break any genre boundaries, but if you a fan of those cheap films made in the eighties like Spacehunter, Land of Doom, or World Gone Wild, this is definitely for you....","6","FlashCallahan"," Have a drink and a Donut.....

"287","In the dystopian near-future, the world is struggling to recycle the limited resources. Future sex is sadly transactional. Sam Treadwell (David Andrews) is a successful executive.

"288","A recent article in The Telegraph predicted that, by the year 2050, human-on-robot sex would have overtaken human-on-human sex; I reckon they could be right if the robots look anything like this film's titular model, the Cherry 2000, created to fulfil its owner's every desire. Blonde, beautiful and obedient, Cherry (Pamela Gidley) seems like the perfect match for Sam Treadwell (David Andrews), which is why he goes to such great lengths to find a replacement body for her memory chip when a frolic on the kitchen floor results in some serious blown circuits. With the only Cherries still in existence to be found in the robot graveyard of Zone 7, a desert wasteland inhabited by dangerous psychopaths, Sam hires the help of pretty 'tracker' E. Johnson (Melanie Griffith), and comes to realise that his ideal woman might not be battery powered after all.Director Steve De Jarnatt's other film, Miracle Mile, is an almost flawless example of '80s apocalyptic cinema—an extremely tense, darkly humorous, and touching example of low-budget film-making revolving around a compelling dilemma—what would you do if you discovered that WWIII was imminent?Cherry 2000, a post-apocalyptic adventure that takes place in the near future of 2017 (next year, as I type), also poses an interesting question—will sex with a machine ever be as satisfying as the real thing?—but despite a much bigger budget than Miracle Mile, the film proves far less successful, thanks to an awkward blend of genres, its clumsy, episodic nature, and questionable performances. Writer Michael Almereyda and rookie director De Jarnatt must shoulder much of the blame, the slapdash story and chaotic direction leading to some really disjointed sequences, including one spectacularly ill-conceived action set-piece in which our heroes cross an obstacle via electromagnet. Griffith is the film's other obvious weakness—she looks lovely (even with her bad hairdo and dubious wardrobe of tasselled post-apocalyptic attire), but fails to convince as a tough cookie who can handle almost any situation.Cult actors Robert Z'dar (Maniac Cop), Tim Thomerson (Trancers, Dollman), and Brion James (Bladerunner, Enemy Mine) join in the 'fun', but can do very little with the messy material (which might explain why Thomerson doesn't even seem to try). Also keep an eye out for an early appearance from The Matrix star Laurence Fishburne in a role that he'd most likely rather forget about.","4","BA_Harrison"," Cherry Bomb!

"289","Cherry 2OOO is a little flick out of 1987 about a guy named Sam Treadwell who bears a striking resemblance to Don Johnson who's out to pick up some chick named ""Cherry"" in a robot graveyard out in zone 7. Melanie Griffith is a tracker, who's job it is to find things in wasteland America after some kind of nuke attack. Steve De Jarnatt directed this epic and another a year later called ""Miracle Mile"". Both films deal with the fallout of human life after a worldwide disaster that puts 90% of humanity back into serfdom. The movie is expertly cast, and the shooting locations throughout are awe inspiring. My first taste to this sweet truffle came as many great viewings do, on Cinemax. The movie is laced with B-movie royalty, Brion James, Robert Z'dar, Tim Thomerson and Pamela Gidley round out the stacked cast in this truly invigorating thrill ride. Lots of stuff gets blown up, plenty of costly stunts performed, and in the end the bot gets got. The story is about a guy with an expensive ""Cherry 2000"" sex bot played by the always sensational Pamela Gidley. She breaks down after a heavy night of dishes and Sam goes on a crusade to get her back online. Tim Thomerson plays one of the figure-heads of the post world, he kills the role of Lester who must have read a lot of self-help books before the blast as he's always reminding his guys to ""be themselves"". Lester's crew is made up of other psycho survivors who enjoy bingo and dancing and killing and wearing cool outfits. The movie addresses some interesting ideas about the future of courtship, with all the diseases now it seems like a robot girlfriend is probably the way to go, but their not human, their just cold machines. Its a fast paced, very scenic, colorful, explosion filled movie thats both pleasing to the eyes as is to the mind. So check this one out and remember BE YOURSELF.","10","peterpants66"," Bone machine

A mad trek ensues, all around a desolate landscape where people don't have anything but machine guns, rocket launchers and gasoline powered vehicles.

"296","Mild-mannered businessman Sam Treadwell (a likable portrayal by David Andrews) hires rough'n'tumble ace tracker E. Johnson (a delightfully feisty Melanie Griffith, who looks great with fiery red hair) to take him into a dangerous region known as the Zone in order to find a replacement model for his beloved Cherry 2000 android (the extremely cute, bubbly and enchanting Pamela Gidley) after the original blows a fuse. Director Steve De Jarnatt does a sound job of creating and sustaining an engaging lighthearted tone, offers a really funny and funky depiction of an oddball future where romance and intimacy have become exceedingly rare commodities, stages the action set pieces with considerable verve, further spruces things up with a fine line in amusing sarcastic humor (the group of blithely loopy and lethal happy health freaks Sam and E. encounter in the Neveda dessert are hilariously terrifying), and gives the picture a certain quirky quality that's impossible to either dislike or resist. Andrews and Griffith display a pleasant chemistry and make for attractive and appealing leads. Tim Thomerson almost steals the whole show with his marvelously batty turn as crazed and charismatic psychopathic cult leader Lester. Moreover, there are bang-up supporting contributions by Ben Johnson as amiable old-timer Six Fingered Jake, Harry Carey Jr. as doddery fuddy dud Snappy Tom, Michael C. Gwynne as sage robotics expert Slim, Brion James as no-count hood Stacy, and Robert Z'Dar as menacing behemoth Chet. Michael Almereyda's witty script delivers a trenchant critique of gender roles and sexual politics, with some interesting stuff about the lack of communication between both sexes and an inspired inversion of the standard action movie cliché with a tough chick protecting a wimpy guy. Jacques Haitkin's slick cinematography gives the film a bright look and makes nifty occasional use of vertical wipes.

Recall how we felt happy when the bride's veil was lifted?Do we cheer for anyone in this one?Is there anything funny about this one?The slobby low-class cow they have in this one is enough for you to hurl.

"314","It's a 5.7... and it's trying to be a tribute to the first film-which was epic-but not a good tribute. Some jokes are good, some characters are ok (e.g Wesley Snipes) but the story and the writing are so lazy and uninteresting that instead of a comedy, it's a sleep-athon.
I give it above 5 because I liked the music, the performances, the costumes and the fact that the original cast got together for this. And for some nice jokes here and there. But...why didn't they try a bit more? With the likes of Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall you can get a great comedy. However, these guys didn't seem to enjoy much being there. The pace is slow and the energy is low in about 80% of the film. Tracy Morgan is not adding anything new and Leslie Jones... was more annoying than funny. The plus points here are that it's indeed a feel good movie if you don't fall asleep... 5.7/10 They could have tried a bit more.","6","ThomDerd"," It could have been great but...

"333","Terrible sequel. The first third provides a nostalgic return of many characters from the original which admittedly brought a few smiles and then goes downhill as soon as the truly atrocious Wesley Snipes is introduced. A real problem is that the ""coming to America"" part is so short lived. That's what made the original funny; the fish out of water tale. The story line involving a genXer going to Africa to wonder in a CGI backdrop world was neither interesting or funny. There would have been so many more options of a buddy movie storyline for Murphy and Hall to shine in but they went with a large portion of the film ignoring the multitude of talent from the original and having a romance between two characters nobody cares about. They could have just done a 90 minute movie based at the barber shop in Queens and it would have been more entertaining. They are lucky movie theaters are still closed as this would have been direct to streaming in any case.","2","jonreastwood"," Terrible. Even without Covid, this is straight to video/streaming stuff

"334","Another reviewer in here mentioned that for everything that Cobra Kai gets right in the nostalgia department coming to America part 2 gets wrong. It seems like almost every character from the first makes an appearance in this one. But where they get it wrong is that very few of these characters really add anything to the movie. And someone forgot to tell them that coming to America was a comedy because coming to America part 2 is void of laughs. People sometimes hyperbolize when they are angry at a movie they thought they were going to like but in this case I can be honest with you and tell you I'm not exaggerating when I say I didn't laugh once in this film.One thing that brings this film down is Tracy Morgan. He brings down most films that he's in and here he adds nothing and he's annoying most of the time. The Leslie Jones character is flat-out horribly written as well. There's not one shred of honesty in anything that she says or does with the exception of her reaction to getting bathed by the royal bather.Where as the original had charm and humor and a lot of fun characters this one recycles the same old jokes except they don't work this time. Eddie Murphy maybe just isn't funny anymore. He'll always be a comic genius to me but maybe you just get complacent and lazy when you get older.The runtime was around an hour and 45 minutes and I think a half an hour of it was spent on dancing. It felt like every 15 or 20 minutes there was another 10 minute dance sequence. You do it once but three or four times just gets to be excessive.Unfortunately the characters that we do like from the original, like Lisa McDowell and her father, Louie Anderson and especially Semi are just given cursory glances and really don't have anything to do in the film. We needed more soul glow and more sexual chocolate and more humor. We might have even needed John Landis to bring his eye for detail to the film.Coming to America joins the ranks of other horrible sequels to beloved films. There is even a sequence in the film where two of the characters talk about the sad state of Hollywood and that all that really exists right now are superhero films remakes reimaginings and sequels to films that nobody asked for. They should have realized that instead of this being tongue-in-cheek it was actually 100% true.1/10","1","baumer"," Terrible sequel

This tarnishes the love story of the original film.The love story in this one is forgettable. I also find it interesting that this was another forced attempt by Hollywood for female empowerment. Of course the girl was gonna be allowed to be queen when it's all said and done. Do I have a problem with that? No. But the forced narrative is an issue to me.I'll say this though, to me the most entertaining scenes all involved Wesley Snipes. I found his character to be hilarious.

Are these screw ups and double standards the problem of western society and it's pandering to feminists, yeah probably they are hypocrites. This film is as funny as not asking for consent is. Trevor Noah and Leslie Jones is in this if that isn't a red flag to how awful this is I don't know what is. The start had white people are evil and privileged trope that keeps going around in a film about black royalty who's more privileged than rich people of colour. No self awareness in this film. The Princess is oppressed more than the poor guy from Queens? This film is written by an idiot. The film is about female empowerment these women are so empowered they can't commit crimes and are above consent. The original characters are sidelined for the new ones. The pacing is terrible.

It's just playing on blatant nostalgia with so many nods to the original that It's practically a remake, and a very bad one at that.

"346","There really isn't much one can say in a review of what is one huge movie bomb ðŸ’£.

Ok Action!"").No creativity (""oh wait, we can send a girl-power message this time - yea, let's add that!""), nor much effort in developing comic moments.I cannot find one scene that works here - it is an embarrassment and I literally cringed watching several scenes.I'm being generous in rating this 2-Stars, and justify such for the costumes and make-up which were the only things that exhibited effort and quality.The absence of Director John Landis in this sequel clearly made the biggest difference between this disaster and the original that did EVERYTHING better than #2.'Coming 2 America' sets the baseline for 2021's worst film.

"348","* SIGH * And here it is, the second ""blast from the past"" disappointment in a row... First, we've got Tom & Jerry with Spike crapping all over the place and now? Now we've got this. Like everybody else, I loved the original movie. Together with Trading Places, it was, like, one of the best comedies from eighties. So, even though I tried to keep my expectations here as low as possible to avoid being disappointed much, I still hoped for good. Like Agent Mulder? I wanted to believe. Unfortunately... yeah. You know how it is. Didn't happen. Like... at all.First of all, it's exactly as forced as you may expect. Every single scene and every single line here screams ""forced"". The original Coming to America was daring, it was fresh and, well, it was... you know... FUN. This? It's just a forced mess. One of those movies that you forget right after you're done watching. Heck, it was actually hard not to fall asleep here. The main idea wasn't really that bad (long story short, the new movie tried to focus on Zamunda instead of Queens), but writing is so terrible that... seriously, how many people worked on the story and screenplay here?Coming 2 America (the one who came up with the title alone should be punished) is one of those movies where some random people talk about some random stuff and you just sit there, wondering why in the freakin' world should you care and when this torture will finally end. Watching this movie? It's like visiting your distant relatives. It's kinda boring, it's kinda awkward and you can't stop thinking about just how much you want to go home. And guess what? The movie is almost two hours long, so I'm really glad that I watched it at home where it was easy to take a break and do some more exciting stuff. Like watching the paint dry, for example. Watching this movie in one sit? It's plain boring. Sure, humor is a subjective thing, but while I laughed all the time while watching the original (still do), this time? I didn't even smile once. It's THAT uninspired. Every time there was an attempt for a joke, I was like ""good grief, seriously?"". The original impact so-o-o ins't here...Also, it's a bit too woke. In a bad way. I mean, don't get me wrong. I like woke stuff. Adds quite a lot to the impact, as long as the writing is right. Then again, you know how it is. There are times when such stuff feels natural. When it does make you care. And there are times when it feels painfully forced, out of the place and actually plays against the writing. You can't just make things interesting and exciting just by saying the right things, you know? You need a good writing to make people feel involved. Here? It feels like nobody even cared. They took one of the most popular comedy movies from eighties, they've tried to re-create some of the most famous parts (like those scenes in the barber shop), they've tried to copy / past some of the old jokes (without much success since, like I said, the original impact is long gone), they've added some woke stuff just because it's a right thing to do and BOOM! Your new Amazon Prime movie is ready. Seriously, guys, those female Ghostbusters were more funny and exciting than this. And I never thought I'll say that. Like... ever!The only thing I actually liked was Akeem's daughters (one of which is played by Eddie Murphy's real daughter, Bella), but guess what? They've barely used the characters. Seriously, even though there was, like, a ton of potential, the girls barely appeared at the beginning and near the end of the movie. While the rest of the thing was just our painfully generic stuff from all those Eddie Murphy movies nobody really cared about. You know, Dr. Dolittle, Nutty Professor... I really wonder if the man is cursed, or something. After the initial success in movies like 48 Hrs., Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, the movies with him started to feel EXTREMELY forced in uninspired. And this one? Heck, even Meet Dave was more funny than this.Not only Coming 2 America was unable to repeat the original success, it's also one of those sequels that actually ruin the original quite a lot. Not only it's forced and isn't funny at all, it ended up ruining good old characters. Lisa McDowell, for example, feels absolutely terrible now, while Cleo barely have a reason to appear. Not only this movie won't make you laugh, there's a big chance it'll actually make you feel sad. Just because seeing a great movie from your childhood being ruined in such a poor way? It's... you know... SAD. Dixi.","1","letande"," Didn't happen...

Even a repetition of the narrative strand of the first would have been better, namely the winning duo Eddie-Arsenio (not at all exploited here even if there are both) who tries to find Akeem's son in America but no, they find him in 5 minutes to then bring him without too much difficulty into the kingdom of Zamunda and the rest of the film has this ""bastar* son"" (line repeated several times ad nauseam) as the main character! What to say, it's the first time I see Jermaine Fowler acting (I'm from Italy and here he's not so famous) I know he's a comedian maybe a good one but didn't have the opportunity to see his comedic talent in this movie and to be honest I would have preferred seeing Murphy most! In conclusion flimsy storyline, lots of random dances and songs, a flood of under-exploited characters (there's also Eddie's daughter, Bella Murphy, here making her debut as Akeem's daughter and playing a couple of lines at most). The only good thing is to see again almost all the old cast and some old characters played by Eddie and Arsenio but (sad to say) both uninspired and not really funny so this reunion can't save alone the whole movie which is a total disappointment.","5","GuidoWithoutu"," Coming 2 Amediocrity

"355","The original COMING TO AMERICA was no accident. It took experienced filmmaker John Landis to pull off what he did for THE BLUES BROTHERS, which came out before working with Eddie Murphy in TRADING PLACES: That is, blending music into comedy without it being a musical-comedy, and very few directors could pull that off, and this sequel is proof... they still can't.It's understandable that the semi-retired Landis isn't on board, but in trying to recreate that same magic originally sparked by the collaboration of Landis and Murphy with only an older, overweight Murphy on board just doesn't feel or look right...The biggest problem is his son from Queens, Jermaine Fowler, with a loud, annoying mother. Then again, their Bad Sit-Com style fits this contrived sequel more than the once-great Murphy, again alongside sidekick Arsenio Hall, who, like all the other familiar faces, seems to be going through the motions. The only new characters that kind of work, allowing Fowler's ""young Prince"" to stretch beyond the intentionally recycled plot, is KiKi Layne as his half-sister, reluctantly aiding in a dangerous task...And Nomzamo Mbatha as his royal hair-cutter and basically the new version of Sheri Headly: a free-thinking bride to change the age-old rules.

Plus, I haven't seen much of Arsenio lately. The premise is great in that, Akeem, left a little secret behind in America and it's time to answer that call. So much time passing works well for that premise also. I don't want to give anything away as it's not exactly a thick plot. I will say some of it, plot and jokes, was predictable. Sequels always have that uphill battle. But, overall it did the job and as far as I was concerned, the surprise of it simply showing up after all these years won me over.

The story is so forced and disjointed and doesn't know what it wants to be that it's uncomfortably frustrating trying to figure out just what the point in this movie is, because it certainly isn't to make you laugh.
Eddie Murphy is simply an empty shell of the comedy actor he was in the 80's, in fact, the whole cast are empty shells here; there's nothing behind their eyes except dollar signs... it's actually quite sickening to see them take advantage of their audience like that. I do get it, of course, it's easy money, and they'd be stupid not to take the gig, but at least put in some effort, ugh, why do I do this to myself?...
Anyway...there's zero spark in any of the characters, and nothing is really driving them. There's no chemistry between anybody in any scene (that we saw), it actually felt awkward to watch the whole time.
The actors are simply saying their lines like it's painful for them to speak, not one of them looks like they want to be there. Which brings me to the dialogue..... I'm not even sure I even want to go there because it's so cringe inducing. Nobody talks like that in real life.
Well, they've already made their money, and it's pretty clear that's the only thing anybody cared about while making this embarrassment to cinema.
It truly saddens me that this is the best they could come up with at this moment in time.

Besides being boring, not funny, stupid, and just desperate, they brought back every previous character and shouldn't have. It seemed like filler to add time to the movie since there was a silly storyline that had nowhere to go or develop. Wesley Snipes' character is so over the top that I couldn't decide if it was bad or so bad it was good.
And there's too much music and singing and dancing (ALL BAD TOO) that it also felt like movie filler since the storyline and characters had nowhere to go and nothing to do.

"372","Coming to America is one of Eddie Murphy's most charming and funny films. The idea if going back to his character of Akeem and bring back most of the cast for a sequel sounds good right? But when I saw the trailer for this sequel I was not expecting much. Trailers, especially for sequels should make you excited to see them. This one didn't. And after enduring the hour and 45 minutes of this film I can see why the trailer was so bad. There was no good laughs to put in it!!!This is one of the worst sequels ever made. I know that it was released straight to streaming but I feel that Paramount must have had no confidence to release this in theaters. Yes I know that theaters are virtually empty because of COVID but if this were released under normal circumstances I think it would have failed at the box office. I get that sequels are mostly cash grabs these days and are almost always inferior to their originals but the dip in quality of this film compared to the first one is gigantic!!! It is not only unfunny, it is aggressively unfunny!!! I might have chuckled once or twice, but it was seriously unfunny. It obviously banks on yhe nostalgia that people have for the original and tries to hit the same beats but fails miserably. They bring back just about every actor from the first film here, but it feels like it's just they were brought back so people could acknowledge that they came back, nothing more!!! But worse is Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall. All of the chemistry they had in the first film isn't here!!! They are just not funny. What they do is supposed to be funny, but it just isn't. They both play multiple characters again, many of the same ones they did in the first one liked the old guys in the barber shop but the scenes just didn't work for me!!! I wanted to laugh but just didn't. Eddie Murphy's performance seems phoned in. He doesn't seem to even want to be there. He can be so funny and in the case of the first film charming. There is none of that here. The supposed story here is that Akeem, now King, finds out he has a son in America. Akeem goes back to Queens to meet and bring his son back to Zamunda so he could become heir to his thrown. Also there is a plot point about a militaristic dictator of a neighbor nation played by Wesley Snipes demanding one of Akeem's daughters marry his son. All of this is more or less done like the first film but without any laughs or charm. I just don't get why so many funny and talented people could be so unfunny. It doesn't help that this sequel comes 33 years after the original film. Nostalgia could only take you so far. Last year Bad Boys For Life did what this film couldn't recreate the feeling and chemistry between its leads and deliver alot of good laughs. Unfortunately, Coming 2 America failed miserably in doing that. The first film is a very funny and charming fantasy. This has none of what made the Coming To America enjoyable.The fact that almost everybody that was in the original is back and that didn't help says alot. Also, I think that the prior film being directed by John Landis helped. He was a very reliable director of comedies. The new director Craig Brewer doesn't seem to have the chops for this material. Bad script, lazy performances from your star equals disaster.I don't know why but Eddie Murphy sequels seem to just be bad!!! I think the only sequel to an Eddie Murphy hit that I've liked is Beverly Hills Cop 2!!!Very Bad sequel here, maybe the worst in his career!!!Grafe: F.","1","flicklover"," Why Eddie? Why?

"376","Big fan of the original. This sequel is just embarrassingly bad. Extremely weird pacing with awful editing.Didn't anyone on the set yell out ""cut cut .. one more take"" ? Because the whole movie needs another take.Huge admirer of Eddie Murphy, loved his performance in ""Dolemite is my name"" and was hoping he would continue in fine form (also Craig Brewer the director).
Sadly Eddie's performance is the weakest one in the movie. Can it be his worst performance yet?In the lead up to the movie I watched Eddie's interviews where he claimed ""we have gone above and beyond with the sequel"". The end result couldn't be further from the truth. Awful direction, filled with lame and cheesy ""Kardashian"" type jokes just to keep up with the times. It just seem so forced.I wished they kept the R rating and the grimy, grainy dirty New York look of the original. This movie looks so crisp, almost like a HD soap opera tv show.The original was such a classic because of the ""raw"" feeling that the supporting cast like Frankie Faison (it's a damn shame what the did to that dog) contributed with. Nothing like this in the new one.Feels like a bad SNL sketch. Clean, lame, weird and without charm. I felt robbed.","2","aliromario"," Weird pace, forced cringy hiphop soundtrack

"380","From the 40 min I watched, It seemed just like a more politically correct version of the original. From the moment in the beginning of the movie where it showed the daughters kicking ass with their Ninja style training, I basically knew the whole plot, right there, I concluded the son was going to be an incompetent fool, and the movie is going to be about how the Kingdom should go to the daughters. Why did assume this? Because I've seen the same plot about 50 times in the last 2 years.To be clear, nothing is wrong with the idea of equality, its great, im all for it It's just, the fact the same plot has been in pretty much every movie in at least some form in the last 2 years. ""Damn the evil patriarchy"", and women are just as good as men, just as strong, just as fast, just as smart, etc etc. Im im not even getting into actual biology here.I'm really confused why there such a hard push for this lately, there was plenty of strong female leads in television and tv even 20 years ago. For example, Sarah Connor in Terminator 2, Ellen Ripley in the Alien(s) films, Captain Janeway in Star Trek Voyager, Samantha Carter in Star Gate SG1, I could go on and on, and these were all VERY strong female characters from around 20 years ago, who were all strong leaders, very intelligent, independant, and physically capable in combat, (even if they couldn't beat up every single man in the world). And back then, the shows were just enjoyable, and not so blatantly crammed with the anti Patriarchy message at the expense of having an actual plot.For those of you who have seen the film Noelle, a movie about a female who becomes the new Santa Claus and fights against the patriarchy, this is almost the exact same film plot, just in a ""Coming to America"" package.If this movie came out 30 years ago, I probably would have loved it, and found it inspiring, fresh, and brave. But at this point in time, it's just predictable, trendy, band wagon jumping, over political, boring crap.I clicked on the button for containing spoilers, but really, the entire movie can be predicted easily in the first 5 min anyway.Can we for the love of god, just have a fun comedy this decade, that's not about the evil patriarchy?","1","corpse_man"," Predictably ""modern"" retread of the original

"402","Of all the evil witches, monsters, dictators, and homicidal maniacs that populated classic Disney animation, Cruella Deville might be the most hated. Sure, she never had plans for world domination and she never even tried to murder another human, but she did the one thing that film audiences can never forgive: she tried to kill puppies. It's for this reason that I've been so skeptical about this film, an origin story that attempts to humanize this character by shedding new light on her turbulent past. The cast sounded stacked and Craig Gillespie is a director I've admired ever since ""Lars and the Real Girl,"" but was it possible to tell a sympathetic, Disney-fied story about someone we know will wind up a would-be dog killer?Well, the answer is yes and no, but mostly yes. Before I praise this film for being such an unexpected gem, let me get the couple of problems I have with it out of the way. First and foremost, without giving any spoilers, I never get the true sense that Cruella is as pure evil as she's supposed to be by the time we get to 101 Dalmatians. She's definitely no hero by any means, but there's not a point where I feel the audience will stop rooting for her. The only other complaint is that there's a bit of a tonal inconsistency at times, as if the film doesn't quite know its target audience. It's certainly not for children, not only is it dark and mature but it's so much of a character study that young kids would be bored, yet there are certain occasions that feature very ""cartoonish"" logic that adults will have to suspend a lot of disbelief over.But on to the good, and the first point of praise is the cast. Emma Stone is absolutely brilliant in this role, and you can just sense that she's having the time of her life playing it. Almost just as amazing is Emma Thompson as the vile Baroness, and when the two are onscreen together the chemistry between the rivals is electric. As far as the supporting cast goes, there really isn't a weak link to be found, with a particular stand out in Paul Walter Hauser who is hilarious as the dimwitted thief Horace. As for Gillespie's direction, the film is beautifully shot and he brings the same stylistic energy he brought to ""I,Tonya"" though it's greatly enhanced here due to the 1970s punk rock aesthetic of the film. This leads me to the soundtrack, which is not only pure awesomeness, but is used to turn Cruella's story into an almost allegory for the transition of London music scene in the late 60s-early 70s.I could go on and on about the individual components that make this film work, but the truth is what really makes it work is how well these individual parts come together in a seamless fashion (no pun intended). In another time perhaps I might be more critical, but honestly it's been a while since I've seen such a major studio blockbuster, especially one based on an established property, that feels like it's actually the unaltered vision of a filmmaker. The story, the cast, the music, the style, everything all fits together to make something truly satisfying. That's how movies are supposed to be made, and with that I give this my first strong recommend of 2021.","9","skeletornumber70"," Maybe Disney can still make unique films

"404","Cruella is full of style and a pretty good time. Emma Stone does great in the titular role, and her presence really ups the enjoyment. Starting off with the good: the production design, costuming, hair, and makeup are so great in this film. Emma Stone gets to rock a ton of different hairstyles, and the period-piece aspect gives opportunities for the costuming team to really show off. The architecture is beautiful, and it does a great job of transporting you to this period in London. I definitely anticipate this film to get some love at the Oscars in those categories. The film is also very colorful and vibrant at times, which was fun. The first act was a bit slow but after about 45 minutes it starts to pick up nicely.Where the film faltered for me was definitely the script. It's not a bad script by any means, but it definitely could have been polished up. Some of the villain's motives are completely nonexistent, and the screenplay makes no attempt to try to explain them to the audience. It was a bit jarring because I thought it would get cleared up in the third act, but they just gloss right over it. The film also doesn't pack any big emotional punch, which isn't a bad thing or even necessary - it just holds it back from being anything great. The film has a good use of licensed music that adds a lot of style to the film, in a similar vein to Joker. However, this did lead me to be a bit underwhelmed by Nicolas Britell's original compositions, which left little to be remembered.Cruella honestly surprised me, and I have to say I enjoyed it quite a bit. It's not changing cinema, but it's fun, stylish, and great time back at the theater. Definitely one of Disney's better live-actions, and I definitely recommend seeing in a theater if you can!","7","elwynchofmann"," It's not changing cinema, but its full of style and a fun time

"405","My Review- CruellaMy Rating 9/10I had a hunch Cruella would appeal to my taste when I saw the trailer but that often can be a disappointment but not in this case.Cruella excelled for me in all Departments Script, Set Design, Costumes Performances and most importantly entertainment value.What a superb pairing of Acting talents the dynamic duo of Emma's with Emma Thompson as The Baroness and Emma Stone as Estella and later Cruella DeVil .Both these fine Actresses are Oscar Winners and both show why they are winners in Cruella , each in equal costarring roles.The blending and chemistry between these two women is so obvious as is the fun they must have both had in performing their respective roles.It's interesting to note that another great actress who portrayed Cruella DeVil ,Glenn Close is an executive producer on this project.I couldn't help comparing these two devilish characters to Raveena the Wicked Queen in Snow White and Emma Stone's character to Harley Quinn colliding in a Devil Wears Prada fantasy for adults and children alike .If you have a bit of a Camp sense of humour and appreciate superb Costumes by double Oscar winner and ten time nominated Costume designer Jenny Beavan plus a great escapist romp you'll love Cruella I'm sure.I think while children over say 10 may enjoy Cruella it's an Adult fantasy comedy Fairy Tale , very inspired I suspect by Ronald Dahl's style of madness and mayhem.""Cruella,"" is set in 1970s London amidst the punk rock revolution, and follows a young grifter named Estella, a clever and creative girl determined to make a name for herself with her fashion designs. After traumatic events that see her alone and defenceless in London Estella is befriended by a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief and individuality. Joel Fry as Jasper and Paul Walter Hauser as Horace have some of the best comedic moments in Cruella as two street wise ruffians who like nothing more than to ""Pick a Pocket or two. They form a trio with young Cruella assisting her with her quest to be a fashion designer by devious means in gaining her employment at the famous ""Liberty"" Department Store.Estella's flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a fashion legend who is devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute, played by 2-time Oscar winner Emma Thompson. Emma Thompson has never looked so chic her sense of comedy timing with sarcastically cruel one liners is superb .The Baroness and her best new fashion designer Estella's relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable, and revenge-bent Cruella.Other standout performances in this ensemble are John McCrea as Artie ,Estella's Camp fashion ally and Mark Strong as the valet to the Baroness.The Soundtrack to Cruella is fun and enjoyable with retro pop hits plus a fun Score by Nicholas Britell to set the action along at a cracking pace.Walt Disney Pictures announced the film's development in 2013, with Andrew Gunn as producer . Emma Stone was cast in 2016 and also serves as an executive producer on the film alongside Glenn Close, who previously portrayed Cruella in the previous live-action adaptations.Cruella had a huge estimated budget of $200million so it needs to be a big hit movie for Disney and I hope this film succeeds .It must be seen on a Cinema Screen don't wait for it to stream it's such a beautiful production and it's creativity needs to be seen as intended on a giant screen.Based on the book 101 Dalmations by Dodie Smith the 5 screenplay writers Steve Zisses, Kelly Marcel, Aline Brosch McKenna, Tony McNamarra, and Dana Fox have done a wonderful job at melding the prequel to Cruella DeVil to the classic 101 Dalmstions and possible sequels .","9","tm-sheehan"," Wonderful romp- Wicked Queen Raveena meets Harley Quinn

Obviously the script isn't the strong side of this movie but anyway it's well-built and the two Emma (Thompson and stone) are really capable of elevate the original material. I also appreciated that you can see a bit of ""auteur cinema"" like some virtuous camera movements. In the end, a good movie and a must-see for Emma stone fans.It can seem a bit too commercial or """"obvious"""" but it's something that you expect from this kind of movie. Go and see it in the theatres!!","7","redaste97"," Good Disney live action

"408","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Besides Cruella's greedy necessities, purely evil personality, and extreme vanity, this wicked character was driven by something completely unthinkable: skinning short-haired puppies to have more success in the fashion industry due to their soft fur. Anyone with a conscience knows that Disney would never bring this character back to the big screen in 2021 without making some changes, especially regarding this motivation in particular. How would a movie with a dog-killing protagonist at its front and center be remotely successful? Obviously, this hardcore motif no longer belongs to Emma Stone's Cruella's defining character traits, which might be a no-no for those viewers who are more protective of the original material, as if times and culture didn't change from decade to decade.Since the start of Disney's live-action remakes campaign, audiences have been divided about how to feel and what to expect from these films. Some wish for a copy-paste version of the same story, while others desire a completely different take on the well-known narrative. However, the best experience - and the primary goal of these movies - is a mix of both: a version that keeps the essence and the message of the original while bringing something new and different to the table to justify its existence. Cruella isn't a remake but an origin(al) story based on a classic villain... And it's undoubtedly one of the best films I've seen this year until this day! I didn't expect to write an extensive review, but with so much to address, I know my thoughts will take a while to transcribe to this article.Let me start with some easy elements that everyone can see and enjoy without having to go into ""deep analysis mode"". The costume design is indisputably the technical standout. The colorfully stunning dresses steal the show visually, but it's how it differentiates Estella and Cruella that Jenny Beavan shines in her job. Just from what Stone wears, the viewers can easily decipher what character she's playing. The differences between the glamorous, rich people that the Baroness surrounds herself with and the dirty, poor friends Estella meets at the beginning of the movie - Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) - is also accentuated through their wardrobes.The extravagant parties are packed with Oscar-worthy costumes, but also with beautiful makeup & hair (Nadia Stacey) and absolutely ravishing production design (Fiona Crombie). Nicholas Britell's score carries little references to the music of the other installments, as does the film itself. Craig Gillespie doesn't hide the Easter Eggs spread throughout the runtime, of which some will definitely please the most avid fans. Technically, it's as gorgeous as one came to expect from the studio, but not everything is as impressive as the aspects above. In a movie where even the black-and-white hair and clothes of Cruella pop off the screen, the CGI backgrounds and animals are way too noticeable for the studio that just made a hyper-realistic remake of The Lion King.CGI dogs are employed during most of the runtime, which is not only understandable but also commendable. Animal violence in filmmaking is a serious topic that fortunately was solved long ago. However, the VFX don't look good enough, causing the dogs - mainly the Dalmatians - to be an unintended distraction. In addition to this, a specific outdoor location that's quite important to the story is surrounded by an awfully dark, fake background that just feels way too off. Finally, the ending boasts a ridiculous sequence made with terrible CGI that will definitely leave the more ""logic-driven"" viewers stunned with disappointment. I consider this a nitpick, especially since it's not a film without silliness.In fact, Cruella's success partially rests on Gillespie's tone balance. Jasper and Horace become the comic-relief characters, starring in the absurd action sequences that occur at parties and other places they decide to steal from. Now, some people might expect that since the other movies are defined by their irrational fun. However, Dana Fox and Tony McNamara's screenplay carries undeniable similarities to The Devil Wears Prada and the most recent Joker. Estella's life story is far from being a happy tale, and Cruella's rise even less. Overall, the balance between the silly comedy and the more dramatic, depressing, traumatic storyline is mostly well-handled, but there are a few moments where Gillespie lets it too loose, especially in the over-Disney-ish last fifteen minutes.So, let's address the two protagonists: Estella and Cruella. The comparisons with Joaquin Phoenix's take on Arthur Fleck / Joker are impossible to unsee. From the upbringing filled with bullying and family tragedy to the final transformation, Emma Stone's character follows a similar arc, but with clear differences concerning the solution for her problems. Estella dreams of being a fashion designer and idolizes the self-centered, self-indulgent Baroness, which takes her down a learning path of how to be successful in the business. The Baroness' despicable treatment of Estella brings the ruthless Cruella gradually back to life, eventually stealing the spotlight from the lovely little Estella who just wanted to do what she loved for a living... without having to carry on extreme measures.An unexpected, clever twist pretty much completes the protagonist's transformation, which genuinely caught me by surprise. I admit that I didn't have high hopes for this origin story. Nevertheless, the well-written screenplay deeply explores a previously hollow villain, offering her a touching backstory and comprehensible motivations. While it's true that she possesses dozens of identical characteristics to the infamous Baroness, Cruella never truly becomes 100% that person. Honestly, I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel, but I don't think there's room for another film that wouldn't hurt the one we just got. So, there's just one more aspect to delve into: the cast's performances.Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser are truly hilarious as the famous duo of thieves. Both share a compelling connection to Estella, one that I believe deserved a better conclusion. They become a family, living and stealing throughout their lives, but when Estella starts giving Cruella some screentime, a few issues arise within the trio. These problems are indeed approached and solved, but in a less dramatic manner than I hoped for. Fry is excellent as the more competent, rational Jasper, but Hauser never stops being extremely funny. The before-mentioned balance is rarely affected by the characters' comedic banter, which is something the actors also deserve credit for.Emma Thompson delivers one of my favorite performances of her recent filmography, interpreting the Baroness von Hellman. How can you make an extremely over-the-top character feel cartoonish yet strangely real? Someone who clearly feels like an exaggeration of a stereotype but still resembles dozens of people from the real world? Thompson takes her role, and the only reason why she doesn't steal the spotlight from everyone else is because the other Emma rises to the challenge of portraying such a classic villain. With obvious references to Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada, Thompson is able to be amusing and vile in the same scene, making every second with her on screen feel incredibly captivating.Nevertheless, Emma Stone manages to stay a level above everyone else. I firmly believe that she's one of the best actresses of her generation. Carrying one of the most expressive faces in Hollywood, Stone was born to play a protagonist with two personalities. Without looking at the screen, any viewer will be able to know if she's talking as Estella or Cruella. Not only she changes the tone of her voice depending on the character, but the mannerisms alter as well. It would be a massive surprise if such an early Disney performance got an Oscar nomination, so her chances are obviously thin. However, if there was an award for Best Monologue, Stone would be a strong contender.I don't recall how many minutes it really is, but I can't forget that long, uncut take with Stone at the center of the screen with nothing but her acting the hell out of an emotionally impactful monologue. Switching between Estella and Cruella in the span of milliseconds, her micro-expressions elevate a heartfelt, character-defining speech that will undoubtedly mark this year of cinema. Stone gives not one but two impressive, attention-grabbing performances that will satisfy most viewers looking for a Cruella they can understand and even root for.Cruella is not only one of 2021's biggest surprises, but it's also one of the best movies of the year so far. Despite the occasional lack of balance between the silly comedy and the dramatic narrative, Craig Gillespie offers an incredibly captivating origin(al) story about one of Disney's classic villains. Dana Fox and Tony McNamara's remarkable screenplay profoundly explores the Estella-Cruella transformation, giving her non-dog-killing, emotionally compelling motivations, a traumatic, depressing past, and an unexpected twist that will probably catch most viewers off-guard. With one of her best performances ever, Emma Stone delivers an award-worthy display, interpreting two personalities in impressive fashion, stealing the spotlight from the other outstanding interpretations. Technically, the distracting CGI in animals and some noticeable green-screen don't overcome the predictably Oscar-winning, stunning costume design, as well as the gorgeous makeup & hair, wonderful production design, and sweet score packed with excellent song choices. A character study that makes this one of Disney's best live-action films in the last couple of decades.Rating: A-","8","msbreviews"," Cruella is not only one of 2021's biggest surprises, but it's also one of the best films of the year so far.

"409","""Another Shadow In The Cloud Phenomena happened again in Cruella, i made a thing called Shadow In The Cloud Phenomena which means the movie did have a bad scene, a weird scene, or a boring scene, but in this case is an ok scene, and then comes this scene that was so good, it's make me hype, it's make me amazed, then i erase that whole thing, i know it sounds weird or non sense but whatever, i don't care, everyone have they're own thing, and again Cruella isn't perfect from the beginning till the middle then come this whole greatness and awesomeness and it burns all that out, Emma Stone is a very very perfect cast as Cruella De Vil, the supporing actor was good and funny, the cinematography was surprisingly incredible, the music is all perfect, everytime they put the music it always a great song, the costume was fascinating, Cruella is so far my personal best movie in 2021, replacing Godzilla Vs Kong in my number one place for best movie in 2021, Cruella is just a perfection, i highly recommended""","10","HabibieHakim123"," My Personal Best Movie In 2021 So Far

For once, there wasn't any political agenda.4. Disney always includes a message in their movies but this time it was actually subliminal instead of the focal point. As the aforementioned states, it also wasn't political which is a big plus.5. There was a point in the movie that I like to call a ""false ending"" where they leave room for a sequel but instead of ending the movie, it keeps going to the next chapter. It makes the movie feel like a long one but in a good way.These are all attributes of an excellent movie and my faith is Disney has been restored because of it.","8","captainlangley"," Original, creative, and humorous

"412","It has been 5 years since I first heard of this movie and lost my head, expecting a Maleficent remake with my favourite villain ever. I was so excited and went in with high expectations hoping for the best and to be honest, I was surprised despite a few small things I picked up. I know the reviews have been hit and miss so far but this one really did it for me. The costumes were amazing, a real stand out, along with the sets and the music as well (all definitely Oscar worthy). The acting was spectacular, particularly from Thompson who made a fabulously hideous monster out of the Baroness. Stone's portrayal of the famous Cruella De Vil was brilliantly exhibited, and many of her scenes (particularly the fountain scene near the end) were my favourites in the film. However, who things in particular stood out for me. Firstly, I believed this film was supposed to be a prequel to Glenn Close's portrayal of the classic villain. However, many things did not match up between the two films. The timeline was screwed, Anita and Jasper's race, Anita and Rodger's professions, Anita's relationship with Cruella. Basically all of Anita as a character did not correspond with the 1996 film and the character even being names ""Anita Darling"" was unnecessary. She was a smaller role and definitely could have been a side character, but not so small that this didn't stand out for me. Also, the graphics in this film were particularly wonderful (the fire and the dogs particularly). However, the ocean at the end are possibly the worst examples of computer animation I have ever seen. This was a real letdown for me and almost ruined the end. However, the film is so wonderfully written and engagingly eventful, no one should let any of these faults ruin the experience for them. Cruella is a brilliant film, and should definitely be praised as one of Disney's better live action movies.","7","reviews4musicals"," I've waited 5 years for this movie and my expectations were high.

"423","Back in 1961; Disney adapted the 1056 Novel The Hundred and One Dalmatians and in doing so; crafted a beloved animated classic and introduced the world at large to Cruella De Vil. The film has not only endured but has spawned television series, a direct to video sequel, merchandise, and two live-action versions.Despite being delayed due to the Pandemic; Disney has scheduled the much-anticipated ""Cruella"" for release and I am happy to announce that the film is a Wickedly Delicious new entry into the series.The story follows young Estella as she and her mom plan to start a new life in London in the 1960s. When tragedy strikes, the young girl finds herself on the streets and working a life of crime and grift with fellow street kids Jasper and Horace.Flash forward to the 1970s and Estella (Emma Stone) toils away in a store cleaning while hoping for her shot in the world of fashion. When fate arrives and places Estella in the path of vain, self-centered, and vicious fashion magnate The Baroness (Emma Thompson); who hires Estella to begin her career in fashion.The savage way The Baroness treats those around her intimidates Estella but her friends Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser); see this as an opportunity to rob from The Baroness and this places them at odds with Estella as her designs start to gain traction.When situations clarify and things begin to evolve into a mission of revenge; Estella transforms into Cruella which had long been the name associated with the darker side of her personality.Cruella takes the fashion world by storm for her innovative looks, bold designs, and theatrical events which upstage the Baroness at major fashion events.With her sales and reputation in decline, The Baroness declares war on Cruella which sets a dark and sinister series of events into motion which drives the film into darker content then one may expect from a Disney film.The cast is very strong as Stone and Thompson are amazing as they are both wicked and captivating without ever going to far over the top or extreme with their characters. The supporting cast is great as well as Fry who was hysterical in the series Plebs brings a depth to Jasper which takes him above just being a stumbling sidekick.Mark Strong also does great work and elevated all the scenes in which he was in with his strong presence. While at first I wondered if we really needed to have this part of Cruella's life told; the story is engaging and the cast is fantastic which makes this movie dark and delightful.While elements of it may not be ideal for younger viewers; the story was captivating and the performances were amazingly engaging.The film ran about two hours and 10 minutes and seemed a bit long in one segment but the film does regroup brings the story home. There is a mid-credit scene audiences will want to stay for as it was an unexpected and very charming nod to what is to come and is not to be missed.It will be interesting to see if the film is the hit that I expect it to be if Disney will consider more films in the series as it would be amazing to see this cast return for further wickedly dark adventures.4 stars out of 5.","8","garethvk"," Cruella Is A Wickedly Delicious New Look At The Classic Character

"444","Greetings again from the darkness. Psychological Thrillers can be quite fun to watch when well-written and well-acted. It's a delicate balance though, since if even one of those elements is lacking, the enjoyment level plummets and the eye-rolling begins. Unfortunately this film from director Vaughn Stein (TERMINAL, 2018) and screenwriter David Murray (his first feature film) is a masterclass in eye-rolling, despite a well-respected and familiar cast.Oscar winner Casey Affleck (MANCHESTER BY THE SEA, 2016) and Michelle Monaghan star as married couple Dr. Philip and Grace Clark. He works at a Psychiatry Institute and she's a local Real Estate Agent. An early scene shows adoring mother Grace driving their young son to hockey practice. Tragedy strikes, and since that night, Philip and Grace barely speak to each other or his teenage daughter (by another mother) Lucy (India Eisley, daughter of Olivia Hussey). All three are grieving in their own way - emotionally isolated from the others. Grace aggressively swims laps day and night in the pool at their stunning modern mansion. Lucy has been expelled from her private school for snorting cocaine during Science Lab. Philip immerses himself in his work with clients, and we know he's smart because he's wearing glasses.One client with whom Philip takes a special interest is Daphne (Emily Alyn Lind, DOCTOR SLEEP, 2019), a troubled young lady from a troubled family. To help Daphne deal with boyfriend issues, Philip uses unconventional personal therapy, which he then presents as a Case Study for students ... against the wishes of his boss and friend Vanessa (Veronica Ferres). This backfires when Daphne seemingly commits suicide, and her grieving brother James (Sam Claflin, THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY) shows up.At this point, everyone is grieving and Philip's career begins to crumble as he's blamed for Daphne's suicide. James turns on the charm for Grace and Lucy, and even though the characters don't get it, every viewer will recognize what's happening, why it's happening, and where it's headed. Even this would be fine if things played out in a clever manner, rather than over-the-top and obvious. Even the Rorschach inkblot tests used as artwork in the pristine Clark mansion are cause for eye rolls. Claflin probably has the most fun of any with his role, but it's Monaghan who comes closest to molding a full dimensional human out of her character. Affleck just adds yet another despondent, joyless character to his resume ... though he does get to throw one tantrum while sitting in his car - alone, of course. Fortunately, these actors will assuredly move on to projects more worthy of their talents.In select theatres and premium VOD on April 2, 2021.","4","ferguson-6"," grief results in our disappointment

More than anything, this movie keeps going back to two frustrating tropes. The first one is understandable but is annoying nevertheless. Basically, one character dares another by offering to do the exact right thing. The other character would get embarrassed and not do that exact right thing. It's meant to build tension but it's too obvious and it keeps repeating. The other move is the characters not communicating with each other. Most of the problems can be solved if they would just tell each other what's going on. They keep not telling the whole story and problems ensue.

"447","Not the actors -- and definitely not the audience. Monaghan at 45 is still trying to transition her career from being the grand prize in every rom-com done in the 1990s to a serious actress. She was awesome in the streamer Messiah but the political correctness police killed the show. Eisley at 27 is still trying to bring back the heat she showed as a teenager on national TV. It will be a very difficult transition. She was awesome in I AM THE NIGHT, but lost here. And Affleck is still trying to show that he is the better actor of the two brothers. He is, actually, but this movie is definitely not the venue to prove it.","5","A_Different_Drummer"," predictable slow-cooker that does no one proud ...

"456","Ferry is an all round entertaining movie that tells Ferry Bouman's story and life about 15 years before the series Undercover will take place. Frank Lammers as Ferry and Elise Schaap as Daniëlle carry most of the movie. As we will see how their romance started.Ferry is the right hand of a rich Amsterdam based drug criminal Brink (Huub Stapel). After they get robbed by other criminals, an ordeal that goes bad. Brink sends Ferry to his home region Brabant to take care of matters and have their revenge. We see that this will change Ferry's life. Some thing he could not have expected to happen.On the downside i missed a bit in character development. Some of the dialogue and interaction could use a bit more depth.The pace of the movie on the other hand is on point and will keep you focused. All in all an enjoyable watch!Must-see for those who have seen (and liked) the Netflix series Undercover.Houdoe!","7","jophetroot"," Entertaining movie - prequel to the series
"
"457","Admittedly this film is probably very much one for the fans of Undercover. If you aren't already familiar with Ferry from that series, you might not be as excited about this film, but if you enjoyed the series you won't feel let down by this movie prequel.Yes, some major characters from Undercover are missing, but given that this is a prequel set a good few years before season one, it wouldn't make sense for them to be present. Instead Ferry is placed front and centre and we get a great backstory to the events that ultimately led to him being investigated in Undercover.Chronologically you could watch this before watching Undercover, but I liked the fact that I already knew aspects of Ferry and Dani prior to watching this and Filip's cameo is definitely funnier.It's brutal in places, as we've come to expect from Undercover, but there are also touching moments and humour too. Frank Lammers imbues a character that could very easily have been a two dimensional monster with a degree of sympathy. If Undercover continues (and I hope it will), we don't know if Ferry will make another appearance, so this is potentially us saying goodbye to him. I'll definitely watch this again.","7","halcyonbear"," Brutal, funny, touching.

"461","It is a story about a criminal who meets a girl. This leads to trouble. Frank Lammers plays his character well and his acting lifts up the whole movie. Elise Schaap is less convincing, just smiles naive into the camera too often. Her script is very cliché. The overall storyline is thin and predictable, halfway I guessed already what the catch was and what will happen next. Some call it a thriller on this platform but there is little suspense and no action.Having said that it is a good film for a casual Friday evening entertainment but do not expect too much. This is a prequel to the series ""Undercover"" which is a very good and entertaining series to watch. So if this is your intro into the Undercover series than this movie is definately worth it.","6","jga999"," Predictable story

"470","Waited for a long time and got what you hoped for.It's a great prequel but nothing more. You can see from the script that it was made under time pressure. Story shows little tension and has no plot twists and innumerable mistakes in time (The film plays in 2006) for example you an see a guy with mouth mask in his car.Only a short prologue shows Ferry's childhood. The rest of the film shows a period less than 1 year as an adult. The writers have made themselves too easy with this choice. But this also has the advantage that there is room for a next sequel:
Ferry II: The king of XTC in Noord Brabant.","7","marcvand"," Nice Snack (frietje Jopie)
"
"471","That Ferry would be less visible in part 2 of the series was of course to be expected since an UNDERCOVER cannot go undercover twice with the same criminal. Only when it turned out that the criminal became the general public's favorite, especially in the Netherlands, was that not really useful for the seie. Something that the Belgian products probably did not expect when they wrote season 2. I kind of got the idea that Netflix then hastily created a movie or the character Ferry for all those people who after season 1 thought that the series was about Ferry. The script therefore seemed hastily written and was not nearly as strong as that of the series.","5","svl-99543"," was a bit disappointing

"
"476","A prequel to the Dutch Netflix series ""Undercover"" (that I haven't watched), Ferry is an engaging gangster drama that tells a rather predictable story. What happens when Ferry Bouman (with a troubled childhood) returns to his native place to locate a rival gang and finish them off? There are certain formulaic elements at play, but director Cecilia Verheyden and writers Nico Moolenaar and Bart Uytdenhouwen never let viewer attention go astray. We get to know more about Ferry in each scene (I can't recall a scene where he isn't present) - he is definitely a grey-shaded human but we root for him because his heart is in the right place.This has, of course, everything to do with Daniëlle (a bubbly Elise Schaap), a woman he randomly meets while on the job. There's occasional humour, interesting-yet-familiar narrative beats, and adequate pacing. The cast and the cinematography need to be applauded for pulling it off quite well. Ferry ticks the appropriate boxes as a crime drama with shades of action, with Frank Lammers' tough-guy act leading from the front. As an origin story, Ferry did grab my attention and piqued my curiosity to watch Undercover sometime in the future.","6","arungeorge13"," Predictable gangster fare, but hits the right notes! [+60%]

"490","Im not disappointed. That's something new for me with the few dutch movies i've seen in recent years. I wouldn't have watched this if it wasn't for the excellent series Undercover. Frank Lammers is clearly at his best, i wonder though if he can give the same level of performance in other roles. Elise Schaap is a great actress. Elise plays a naive small town girl fom Brabant. Though Elise is not from Brabant, as Danielle in the movie she speaks the accent. That's admirable but as a native Brabander i hear her trying and it's not ..eh..native. Huub Stapel playing a druglord from Amsterdam trying hard to insert an Amsterdam accent wasn't convincing at all. So Eline and Frank made the movie. They connect very well. The story is thin, it is what it is with hardly any full lines let alone a deep conversation. Basically everything is said with a few words. But that's ok, it suits this movie and the characters. Hopefully there will be a next part and maybe, if possible with this story and these characters, a bit more depth and surprise elements,...","7","Noviomagum"," Ok.., not far fom good

"491","Onemanshow with.some small parts for other familiair Dutch actors. Don't expect a lot of character development or great scenes with class acting.

Certainly if you ignore the sloppy murders in brought daylight.","7","Maafushi"," Entertaining but unbelievable
"
"492","This film is actually excellent. It is well written, the photography is absolutely on point and the character development flawless. Frank Lammers plays the charismatic Ferry Bouman with a steady pace without ever making you challenge whether this guy existed or not, because you wish he hadn't for being the ruthless criminal he is. Outstanding work by the director Cecilia Verheyden who also knew exactly what to show to click with the fans of the ""Undercover"" series without letting the new viewers unhooked and lost with references.This film is indeed even more violent than the Undercover series but those moments are necessary to understand the depth of the show based on it as it happens that the show itself lacks background on Ferry, making him in the process an anti hero instead of the criminal you supposed to condemn.Please do not hesitate to watch if you're a newbie in the world of ""Undercover"" and if you are not, this will be your film of the summer.","9","chad_muskater"," The Dutch Scarface

"501","People saying that it was a cheap remake of the Goonies completely missed the point of the entire movie. It had a beautiful message of staying true to your roots, the importance of family, and respecting native cultures. Showing the real side of Hawai'i with local values, pidgin, 'olelo Hawai'i, customs and history was the best part of the movie in my opinion as someone born and raised on the islands. The Nightmarchers scene was my absolute favorite and was so touching and powerful. The local portrayal of Hawai'i is almost never scene in mainstream media so this was refreshing. Also, casting actual Pacific Islanders, Kamehameha grads, and people born and raised in Hawai'i was awesome. A great family-friendly movie.","10","erinkimie"," Great movie that displays the true Hawai'i

"502","My daughter and I watched this movie tonight and absolutely loved it. Being from Hawaii and now living in the mainland it was fun to watch this movie... yes it's very much like goonies but the infusion of the Hawaii culture, language and folk lore made it all the more special. The night marchers story was very similar to what we were taught growing up as was the pidgin and infusion of Hawaiian words. Loved that their home was authentic with glass jalousie windows and tons of wood paneling. The filming of most of the film appears to be in Hawaii and they even have Halona beach from "" from here to eternity"" in it. The cast looks like the majority of them are from Hawaii which is refreshing considering the majority of the tv shows filmed in Hawaii have lead characters who are not from Hawaii and butcher the Hawaiian Pidgin and culture. The family relationship is realistic and my kids could identify with the siblings. It was.clean and light hearted.

"511","Pili (Kea Peahu) has her sights set on attending a Geocaching camp, but after her grandfather (Branscombe Richmond) has a heart attack, Pili must forfeit her prize and go to Hawaii with her mother Leilani (Kelly Hu) and brother Ioane (Alex Aiono). Once there Pili finds a journal among her grandfather's possessions that tells of a group of privateers who hid a cache of gold on the island and sets off to find the treasure unaware of the dangers surrounding it.Directed by TV sitcom staple Jude Weng and written by comic book/screenwriter Christina Strain whose work can be seen in cult favorite TV show The Magicians and Netflix's upcoming series Shadow and Bone, Finding 'Ohana marks another original by Netflix. Finding 'Ohana feels like a mixture of Lilo & Stitch by way of National Treasure, and while there are good elements on display, the movie is a little clumsy out of the gate.Kea Peahu makes her debut here as our protagonist Pili and brings a natural energy to her performance that is engaging. She does a good job conveying the drive, stubbornness, and arrogance of her character and has some nice moments of vulnerability and pathos throughout the film. YouTube personality/singer Alex Aiono makes his film debut here and for the most part does reasonably well, but sometimes the clunky material especially early on doesn't allow him to make the best impressions, but despite this he does feel engaging and falls comfortably into his role as the older brother dealing with an overly energized mischief prone sister. The supporting cast is also quite good. Kelly Hu despite a somewhat limited role plays her role as a struggling single parent trying to juggle multiple crises at once quite well and Branscombe Richmond plays the curmudgeonly grandfather character quite well and has some very sweet moments with Kea Peahu as Pili where they convey a genuine sense of family. But easily the best performance is Owen Vaccaro as Casper a nerdy overly cautious neighbor who Pili (kind of) befirends who gets some very funny scenes and lines in the movie. Vaccaro was previously seen in The House with a Clock in its Walls playing a lead and its nice to see him here again giving another good performance.The movie itself is very hit and miss, the opening is very clumsily handled with characters often telling us about situations rather than showing us them, and while the characters feel like there's a richness to be explored for engagement and pathos, it often feels like those take a backseat to shenanigans and very on the nose humor. There's also not much in the way of drive at the beginning of the treasure hunt as the movie just kind of ambles along from one marker to the next. The flashback sequences are also rather underwhelming as they're subject to a running gag where the characters in the flashbacks will speak anachronistic dialogue as dubbed by Pili's Kea Peahu that is somewhat chuckle worthy upon first impression but becomes kind of grating upon repeated use. By the half way point I was ready to label this a very ""meh"" movie, but then it kept going.After a flabby first half that's haphazardly delivered the movie course corrects and makes its stakes more dire and adds some tension and drive that's been missing from the movie up to that point. Without giving too much away there's some scenes of visual wonder and danger that all tie into the themes of family and Hawaiian mythology quite well and actually make the movie feel more engaging as it goes on.Finding 'Ohana is clearly meant for a family audience, and as a family film its perfectly decent. The acting is spot on from everyone involved and the exploration of Hawaiian mythology is quite fascinating (though admittedly I'm unaware of how accurate it is) and the sense of adventure is quite fun once it gets going. Unfortunately clunky writing and an overly slow pace in the first half create some hurdles the movie needs to work around, but once it finds its footing it becomes an engaging adventure.","6","IonicBreezeMachine"," A mixture of treasure hunting adventure and family melodrama that stumbles at first but finds its footing as it goes on

Some of the heart-to-heart scenes, I had to actually look away at how terribly acted it was. Also find the camera angles jarring and almost like a Z-list, low budget TV show. How this movie got 81% on Rotten Tomatoes, I'll never know. No charm, totally uninspired plot, awful script and cringeworthy, dreadful acting.There is also a ridiculous scene where the characters start singing (ridiculously autotuned) while traversing a lava lake, just totally weird decisions all throughout this movie. I give it a 2/10 as kids ages 3-7 will most likely enjoy some of it. As a Netflix movie, you'd expect a decent budget, but it genuinely looks like it was made with less than 200k. Don't expect even close to The Goonies or Indiana Jones (although there is a weird cameo from Jonathan Ke Quan (Goonies and Indiana Jones) . The ending is what totally throws the movie even more off course, what is with the supernatural turn it takes with ghosts? Makes absolutely no sense and totally not inline with what the movie was about! Actually astounded that this movie managed such high Rotten Tomatoes reviews that I am actually putting the reviewing site down in my estimations because of it.","2","chazsmith-01093"," Terribly acted, terrible script, terrible movie.

"516","This film start with a bunch of people riding bicycle, and a girl ""Pili"" winning the treasure hunt contest with her friend scene! As turnout, this film is about Pili need to find the treasure in the cave on the Hawaii Island, to help her grandfather have his house back! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the singing scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the slow motion scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the tripping scene, overuse of the talking with phone scene, and overuse of the playing dumb scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, Casper letting Pili use his shirt to wipe off her nasal mucus! At the end, Pili, and her family move to live with her grandfather at Hawaii!

"518","This movie was really-really stupid. It's like some Hawaiian's wet dream of what Hawaii should be ... but isn't. First, nobody lives like this in Hawaii! I've lived on 3 islands for over 30 years and I can assure you that this movie is a parody of Hawaiian life. From the hick cars, to a guy that's about to lose his house on O'ahu for not paying 5 years back taxes ... that'd be like losing a million dollar home and land for about $10K in taxes.Then there's the language and speeches of EVERYONE. Nobody talks like this here. Pidgin? Sure! But not like they portray.The way they treat kapuna and heiau's would, or should, insult just about every local here.The portrayal of the living conditions all the way to the POS island cars is ludicrous at best. This would be right for a person living in Puna on the Big Island (but doubtful) but the islands don't allow junk cars much (safety inspections required here) ... lots of rust buckets, but that's about it.The use of a box of spam by a kid to reach the pedals on a car?! Not even.Everybody like, ""ohana"" and always giving away fruits, fish, etc... Hawaii is friendly, the people great, but this?! No. And the way it tries to shame the Hawaiian that's moved to New York is shameful in itself.Much of this is a rip of other shows ... especially ""The Goonies.""Casper, the white-redhead haole kid, is typical of the stereotyping of this show.The lack of respect of these people, especially the young to the older generation, is plain silly for Hawaiians! I tell you, aunty ever here her keiki give lip or stink eye like dat, she give'em the slippa!Anyway, this show is a four at best and that's because there's not enough Hawaiian motivated movies and it tries to portray the island as something magical (which it is) but in a horrible fashion! Watch ""Lilo and Stitch"" and you'll have a MUCH better representation of the islands.","4","delzog"," A wet dream for the non-Hawaiian

There's just no arc to the story. It's also way too long, it's about 2hrs when I feel like 90mins would have been plenty.

"530","Finding OhanaThis was aimed at a very young audience, I would guess no older than 14. There were very few good things, like the scenery or the sea, the rest was largely bad on many levels.For instance the mother was just nasty to everyone, had I been her child I would have divorced her. There was an equally nasty feminist/female empowerment thread that I found distasteful where all the men were portrayed as idiots in comparison to their female counterparts. It was grossly imbalanced.Believe it or not one character said ""I am frightened to go to New York because it might make me uncomfortable with who I am!"" What snowflake mind did that come from, what culture is so fragile that a trip to McDonald's threatens it.Ordinarily I would have given this a 5 but I sense a political brainwashing agenda so it's a 4 out of 10, meaning steer clear.","4","martimusross"," Politically Correct Kiddies Drama, Avoid This Tripe!

"534","Finding 'Ohana is a Netflix movie about a Hawaiian family uprooted from their family home in Brooklyn and move in with their aging grandfather in Oahu to help him with his health. Along the way the siblings find a journal pointing to a long lost treasure that sets them on an epic adventure around the island. The adventure leads them with new friends to reconnect with their Hawaiian heritage. The cast includes the beautiful Kelly Hu as the single mother raising to her two kids and Branscombe Richmond as Kimo the grandfather who had not paid his property taxes in over five years. The kids hope finding the treasure would help save the property. The back story of the pirates were portrayed by SNL alumni Chris Parnnell as well as Marc Evan Jackson, they made the story more entertaining. The movie was very family oriented but I didn't care about the adventure but the ending was very heartwarming and the meaning of 'Ohana brought a positive overall vibe to the entire flick.

Night marchers are a thing we grew up with. Thanks for making a movie that represents me, a mix plate local girl!

"540","Being a Hawaii resident, born and raised, I found this movie to be absolutely unwatchable. I watched about 15 minutes, then fastforwarded, just watching bits of it only because my husband wanted to see what they they found. I very very rarely am nauseated by a movie script, and love watching things filmed in Hawaii. It was so predicatable and corny and I kept thinking ""OMG, people are going to think Hawaii is like this."" From the Papa cutting a mango, neighbor boy saying ""Aloha,"" all those Hawaiian names and words, etc. Yes, people are reviving the Hawaiian language, which is great, but you don't hear it used as much as the movie indicates.
I suppose this was written for kids and teens so I shouldn't expect much, but I certainly didn't expect my eyes to ache from rolling.

A Hawaiian family living in Brooklyn returned to Hawaii, went on a treasure hunt, and reconnect with their Hawaiian heritage.Now I'm aware that the movie aims toward family and kids, but I just could not like this movie. The acting was pretty bad, especially the main kid. I felt like she tried too hard to be edgy. The dialogues and jokes were mostly cringe and cheesy. When the characters retold the lore, the movie used the Ant-man lip syncing. Now in Ant-Man, Michael Pena was great the lip syncing worked very well. However, the lip syncing was quite bad and unfunny in this movie.The theme of movie was about reconnecting with one's heritage. I really liked the theme, but I don't think the story delivered and emphasized the theme enough. I don't feel connected enough to these characters to appreciate their change at the end, even though the change was pretty obvious.I still liked some part of the movie, particularly the interesting Hawaiian lore and culture.

The older brother is an absolute tool an treats everyone terribly. The dialog is just poorly written and embarrassing. The worst part for me is that it follows netflix's woke parameters. All the male characters are bumbling fools, weak ""soy boys"" or stubborn mean old men. The only strong characters are females, and its perfectly fine to make fun of white people. The white people jokes arent funny, just nasty. From constant use of slang for white people, to a pasty character named ""Casper"" to complaining about bland food by saying ""what are we, white?!"" Its just annoying.In the end, its worth a watch with your kids and keep it light.

There are cringe inducing moments, unfitting musical choices, and awkward acting performances, but a decent plot, beautiful scenery, and a well crafted script keeps this flick about family and cultural heritage afloat.Certainly a movie to be enjoyed with the family and a bowl of popcorn.","7","jreagan-42424"," Fun, light-hearted family fun

"596","Families do not always bond nicely. In Finding 'Ohana, two siblings from New York embark on an adventure in O'ahu, Hawaii and try to connect with each other and with their Hawaiian heritage while they discover the mysteries of the island. This movie is about traditions, embracing your culture and respect.The film has the perfect adventure spirit. Pili (Kea Peahu), a 12-year-old girl and her brother Ione (Alex Aiono) are always fighting. With their mom, they go to their native island, O'ahu, to visit their grandfather whose health is delicate. The mom, Leilani (Kelly Hu), doesn't get along with her family all that well. It's as if all these different generations are colliding, but through the unusual experiences and with help from new friends, they discover the greatest treasure - the love of family (ohana).The movie mixes fantasy and adventure, a little romance, humor and drama in a fun way. This story remind of Goonies and has some elements from the classic 80s films like Indiana Jones, but deals with contemporary subjects of identity and multi-cultural issues. The scenes were filmed on various locations on O'ahu, which gives the film a very authentic tone. The sightseers are beautiful and there is some lovely underwater photography. The story is entertaining and keeps you focused most of the time. Some visual effects and practical sets are not all that impressive, but the performances are very good and make you connect with the characters and what they are going through. Kea Peahu, who plays Pili in her film debut, is amazing in the leading role. I love the songs in the soundtrack and the way the music is incorporated into the storyline. I also love that the film reinforces the importance of a simple life; sometimes we focus on our dreams and goals; we forget about the beauty that is in front of us in our everyday life.The message of the film is that love of family is unconditional despite our differences.I give Finding 'Ohana 4 out of 5 starts and recommended for ages 5 to 18, plus adults.

"601","This film is inspired by the life of Elisabeth Fritzl and the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father, Josef.I knew going into this that it is not a big budget movie. This is a lifetime movie. I know that people like to hate on these simplistic made for TV films but I happen to enjoy them regardless. As long as the acting is tolerable and the storyline is decently put together. This film met my requirements.No. It doesn't have the greatest actors but considering the subject matter they were portraying, I thought they were fairly good. The subject matter is awful but there is no need to feel as though you will be watching horror level violence or sexual assaults of an overly graphic nature. This is tame in those regards.I personally liked the film. I found it to be a decent watch. If you like Lifetime movies, this is going to be right up your alley.

The acting was ok, and though the two eldest children should have been nearly adults, they looked 14 and 12. Perhaps to showcase the stunt of growth? Idk but my biggest disappointment was the ending. It felt rushed. I would have loved to see her mom and sisters reaction of reuniting with her vs an old flame who we are supposed to believe waited 20 years for her return on the same bike he'd been riding since the beginning of the film. I would have loved to see her reaction to the son she sent to be raised by her mom. Maybe even her mom and sisters disgust toward the father would have been great.

"606","Girl in the Basement is loosely based on Josef Fritzl of Austria who imprisoned his 18 year old daughter Elisabeth in a basement prison for 24 years during which time she gave birth to SEVEN of his children. Three kids were raised in the basement with Elisabeth, three were raised upstairs by Josef & his wife, and one was killed by Josef a few days after his birth. I'm stating all this information because reviewer DEEDRALA said it wasn't based on a true story when in fact it most certainly is. Judd Nelson gave a chilling performance as Don, the psycho father who locks his daughter, Sara in the basement for twenty years. The movie starts with Sara sneaking out to a party with her boyfriend, her dad catches her and she's grounded for one week. Don overhears Sara telling her mom & sister that she's leaving as soon as she turns 18 so she can travel the world. We are told Don is controlling and crazy but how does he go from grounding her for sneaking out to locking her in the basement for 20 years ? The man goes from concerned dad to full on sociopath in minutes and I'm not buying it. Josef the actual monster who did this in real life showed signs long before he locked up his daughter. He served time for rape while he was married, he started raping Elisabeth when she was eleven years old, and he started building her prison three years before he locked her in there. Also in the movie Sara looks exactly the same when she leaves the bunker twenty years later, they could've at least aged her a bit. Once again LMN wanted to cash in on a tragedy but they didn't want to actually research anything.","6","jennfinn"," Based on Monster Josef Fritzl.

"609","Now I do not usually write reviews on IMDB despite having this account for years but this movie... While the true story this is very loosely based on which is a horrible and vile story, this movie feels rushed, jarring, and has very very little reason to existThe acting is subpar but that's what Lifetime is. The plot and character motives make 0 sense. Then on top of that, the tone is just so depressing but just over the top.To start off, the father's motives to lock her daughter in a bomb shelter which by the way...HOW DOES NO ONE KNOW ABOUT THIS!His motives to lock her up, rape her and breed her is because she's being a teenager sneaking out of the house. Now if the dad had a scary past like he's a serial killer like in The Stepfather but no. This all comes out of nowhere because of what? Toxic masculinity? No Oedipus Complex? No past of him killing or criminal history. Loss of his wife or even his whole family besides his daughter? NopeAll the side characters are also TERRIBLE! The mother who doesn't wonder where her husband goes all day even after threatening to get a private investigator. Saying she won't go in the basement bc she doesn't like rats or whatever. The sister who was IN THE BASEMENT WITH KEYS never further investigated her father or the basement after his sporadic response. The boyfriend who has talked to the sister and the film seemed like it was pushing towards a team up to investigate the house but it goes nowhere just like everything in the film. The argument scene between the sister, mother and father have no progression even though it hinted towards it. With the mother threatening a PI, the sister questioning if the dad did something, his defensive responses. HOW DOES NO ONE CATCH THESE RED FLAGS!Then the actual girl in the basement has no uphill battle and tries to fight back once. Even when there's a hole in the ceiling, she just forgets about it. Like it goes from thinking ""Hey maybe she make a plan to escape or fight back."" because that's where the momentum was going...then it flashes forward a year. That's the pace of this movie.The tone overall is just edgy, triggering, and over the top. The rape scenes are so sudden and jarring going for a trigger factor and not from something rooted in his past or something in his arc. There is no strong female character in our protagonist where we root for her. Give Don't Breathe for example. It ended up in a similar scenario where the blind man forced breeding on the female protagonist. But here, there's a strong moment where he gets taken down and well for those who have seen that movie you know...he gets what he deserves. This film is missing something like that. A part showing the dad isn't an unstoppable force, that he has a weakness.Even the ending when he gets caught was unsatisfying. He could've at least been thrown down by the cop if he fought back. Show the audience the father getting what he deserves. His character is vile and evil (while unknown where this rooted from)There is very little redeemable moments from this movie besides the fact of spreading awareness in sexual assault which is why this gets 1 star for me.I recommend watching The Stepfather (1987 version is best) or Don't Breathe then this mess of a film.","1","Stasjs"," Some stories should not be adapted

"612","Why would they hire actress Elisabeth Röhm, to direct this film, when she's never been behind a camera before? This was such a troubling and horrific true story event, it needed professionals to tell it. The screenplay was on point, but Röhm's failure to direct her cast and scenes properly, really failed this film. Performances were adequate to decent, but that was strictly from the merits of the actors following a screenplay. Stefanie Scott's performance got better as the movie progressed, but I'm sure that was due to her getting comfortable with her character. Even Judd Nelson's performance was stale and amateurish, that with a better director, he would've shined. Had a seasoned director been involved, this could've been much more gut-wrenching and epic film. Nevertheless, it's a story that needed to be told, and I'm glad it was; It was a bold move for Lifetime to produce this. I just wish it was told in a better way.

For 20 years, a girl lived underground below her family's house, and even though her mother and sister lived on top of it completely (none of them thought for once during the 20 years to go down to the basement to search for their daughter! And what the excuse: fear of mice) !!!For bloody 20 years of AGONY, the girl did not get sick even once , she did not lose one of her teeth, she did not suffer from pain and cramps due to sleeping on the cold floor, she didn't lose the shine of her beautiful skin! , she did not lose her hairstyle!, and she even did not lose the shape of her body (Never) even though she has been pregnant four times in row!!!!When they went out the basement after 20 years (What a surprise) all of them in excellent physical and mental health, they went out into the sun as if nothing had happened .. Children infront of the lake play with each other normally.Did the director think that this is a natural scene of two children who didn't see the sun from the moment of their birth until the ages of 16 and 18 years?And the young man (the girl's boyfriend) !!! Oh my God,What is this nonsense? !!! A 38 years old man who once loved a girl in his teen when he was 18 years old, he did not marry! He didn't get another girlfriend! He did not travel, go to university, or live his life like any normal young man .. No, simply, he had not seen her for 20 years ... He is still waiting for her!

"619","This may be pure fiction but more likely loosely based on Austria's Josef Fritzl who in 1984 admitted that he imprisoned his own 18 year old daughter Elisabeth in the family home basement and where Josef repeatedly raped her to which seven (7) children were born out of his incest with daughter Elisabeth. Elisabeth gave birth to seven children during her twenty four (24) years of captivity. I fear that it is stories such as this that create copycat monsters who make reality out of fiction.There is another similar themed film made in 2015 titled simply ""Room"" in which actress Brie Lawson won her Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role. This film starred Stefanie Scott as Sara the imprisoned daughter of Don played to perfection by Judd Nelson, For a made for TV film which are usually produced on a shoe string budget there was little creativity with the wardrobe and makeup and as such, the twenty (20) year elapsed time while Sara was imprisoned with two of her three children did not result in her or her children showing the expected tired aging of living without sunlight, and minimal nutrition and/or professional healthcare. In fact her third and youngest child born named Christofer who was allowed to live upstairs with his grandparents looked as if he was several years older than his own older imprisoned brother Michael.For people who are fearful of imprisonment I would not suggest you watch the film as actress Stefanie Scott did a relatively realistic job of convincing us that she was imprisoned over twenty years in the basement. But maybe with most of the film which appeared on screen occurred in the basement set maybe actress Stefanie Scott was actually going a bit stir crazy being stuck in a confined space without sunlight over most of the film's scenes she appears in.I give this made for TV film a decent 6 out of 10 rating for the more than adequate performances of Judd Nelson, Stefanie Scott and Joely Fisher. But on a personal note, it would be my choice that these types of films were never allowed to be viewed to ensure the worlds whack-a-doodles did not have any inspiration to make their illegal and unrealistic fantasies come true.","6","Ed-Shullivan"," This is the type of story that whack-a-doodles get their insane ideas from just like Josef Fritzl did

"623","Directing: Elisabeth Röhm did a great job with this small budget movie and delivered the message she intended to send, although there were many flaws and mistakes, but the message did go through as intended.Production: Again, this is a low budget movie and have as a result some limitations that were obvious. I genuinely believe that with some extra effort this would have been an amazing theatrical piece but sadly it's not. Nevertheless, they did a great job.Script: Although the movie is classified as Crime and Thriller, the story is based on the real-life events of Elisabeth Fritzl and the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father, Josef. Even though the story is well documented, it took 3 writers to write it and did so horribly. The script is a major setback imo.Acting: Stefanie Scott did great and so did Judd Nelson whom I did not even recognize at first. Almost all did a good job but what disappointed me the most was that the horribly written script that clearly showed in their performance.Cinema and sound: To be honest, while watching, neither the music nor the camera work bothered me. They did a better job than I expected.Conclusion: These kinds of stories need to have a weigh and a certain play on emotions as well as balance of power. On one hand would be the abusive power the dad holds against the daughter and her own power to withstand and live through it. Sadly, the latter was not as evident.I give Girl in the Basement a rating of 5/10.","5","Drogan-Hex"," Unpleasant

It wasn't until the first cut to black during a tense moment that I realized this is a Lifetime made for TV type movie. With that taken into consideration, it held my attention well enough. What trumps even the poor acting and cinematography was the method of story telling. They attempt the classic move where they show a scene from near he end of the movie and then jump back 20 years earlier, slowly building back up to that moment to continue from it. The problem is that this particular scene shows us that any attempt at escape we see throughout the first hour will be unsuccessful, killing any tension and momentum.

This movie is made with balance especially in the aspect of how the evil dad captured her and did things to her. They didn't go overwhelm about it; but audience got the idea about how the daughter is being treated. The story entails about how mean a father could be just because of his own wrecking marriage as it was found that his wife has an affair too; which has consequently lead him to see his daughter as an object for revenge; with her rage attitude. To me, mr Director has successfully delivered his best as he was able to keep the story precise and concise from beginning till end. No dragging here and there. Well done.

"639","I find Hallmark/Lifestyle style movies pretty tedious to be honest and more of something I would imagine bored housewives watch in the afternoon whilst doing the ironing or changing nappies and I would imagine for most men they hold zero interest; in addition, I found this one quite disturbing and more down at heel and depressing than normal!Quite why they make movies like this is also puzzling as it is rather sick to me as it just seems like prurient, cashing in on true life misery. It is of course based on the Austrian Fritzl case and many others in that have been uncovered in the USA, we had them in the UK with the Fred & Rosemary West sickos - we all know about it, we all care about it, we all realise it is probably going on in our own neighbourhoods as we speak; maybe even next door but it really does not need exploited and I find films like this quite sad in this respect.Decent acting from all but the film left me cold and bored rigid waiting for it all to be over after 15 mins in - Never a good sign!","4","omendata"," Why do they make these films?

"641","Girl in the Basement is my latest write-up. It's a brutal experience not a movie and I don't think I could sit through it again. That doesn't mean it's not recommendable.So yeah, ""Basement"" is a Lifetime film on anabolic steroids. It makes other Lifetime endeavors feel like child's play in comparison. The despicable antagonist in ""Basement"" is played by Judd Nelson. If you thought you hated his John Bender in The Breakfast Club, you ain't seen nothing yet.Girl in the Basement is like 2015's Room bucked up about ten notches. And if you're easily upset and/or wholly traumatized, you might wanna stay clear of ""Basement's"" tormented, 88-minute running time.The director of ""Basement"" is actress turned rookie helmer, Elisabeth Rohm (she makes a cameo too). Rohm's debut is impressive as she uses two or three locations and creates a level of claustrophobia and pseudo Stockholm syndrome. Heck, ""Basement"" contains the type of cinematic, family dysfunction that would make Maury Povich eat his heart out.Based loosely on a true story and spanning about twenty years, Girl in the Basement is about a father (Judd Nelson as Don) who holds his youngest daughter captive in his downstairs abode. He abuses her, rapes her, and in disturbing fashion, she ends up mothering three of his children (with one added miscarriage brought on by brute violence).In retrospect, I was almost reluctant to review Girl in the Basement because well, the putrid subject matter punched me in the gut once too often. However, the somewhat happy ending and eventual rendering of the outside world was enough to suffice. ""Basement"" is a Lifetime pic that other Lifetime pics couldn't touch with a stick. It will affect you terribly and make you realize that today's environment although hard up, might not be so hard after all.","8","burlesonjesse5"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Girl in the Basement

"647","Girl in the Basement is a win for modern Lifetime -- timely, reasonably well acted and presented, dark but not devoid of hope. It is the fictionalized account of the 24-year ordeal Elisabeth Fritzl endured at the hands of her abusive father.In a few words, this adaptation is a story of stolen innocence and youth, fortitude, and survival. At least that's how I saw it.Though my own childhood experience with my father was *nowhere near* as harrowing as what is depicted here, as someone who contends with PTSD, I gravitate toward titles like this to challenge and, if necessary, buttress my recovering mind, and though Girl in the Basement made for a deeply difficult watch, I actually felt more empowered than not by the end.This girl -- this woman, this mother -- fought to stay alive, fought for her children, and she survived. Maybe it's strange to feel proud of someone you don't know and will never meet, but...maybe it's not. *That's* what I took away from this as a viewer.Above all, the film will make you feel. Disgust, anger, frustration, trepidation, sympathy, curiosity, bewilderment, admiration for the character based on Fritzl herself (portrayed proficiently by Stefanie Scott) -- you won't walk away from this without having an opinion on it, and in that respect, the work works.It's not a perfect or even great telling by any means, but the film will also make you think. It raises awareness -- inspires people to become more familiar with Elisabeth Fritzl's story and, by extension, the idea of exploring all options when a person goes missing or isn't directly heard from in years. It contributes to conversations on sexual abuse and the devaluation of human life, particularly in regard to women and the efforts made to control them. It reinforces the collective need to get these topics out in the open so we can work on preventing/protecting each other from like tragedies.In sum, this movie will make you think and feel if you let it. Will you let it?Speaking as a trauma survivor who's seen this to trauma survivors who haven't: It may very well be too much at times, but I would still recommend giving it a try if you're interested in doing so, or fast-forwarding/leaving during certain parts. Please, set your own pace. But know:You can get through this.WE can get through this.","6","BritneyPWrites"," An effective-enough telling of a true-life tragedy

Kudos to all those responsible for that. On the other hand, this movie does a poor job of character personalization and story plot. Had a lot of fake smiles and poor dialogues, did a poor job of making you feel for any character's situation and wanting more from them, it's like the movie pauses when scenes switch from the Kaijus to humans.

"657","Five years after Godzilla defeated King Ghidorah, Kong is monitored by Monarch within a giant dome on Skull Island. Kong is visited by Jia, the last Iwi native and Kong expert Ilene Andrews' adopted daughter, who is deaf and communicates with Kong via sign language.Bernie Hayes, an employee of Apex Cybernetics and host of a Titan conspiracy theory podcast, extracts data suggesting sinister activities at a Pensacola facility. However, Godzilla suddenly attacks the facility; during the rampage, Bernie stumbles on a massive device. Madison Russell, a fan of Bernie's podcast, enlists her friend Josh to investigate Godzilla's attacks. Apex CEO Walter Simmons recruits Nathan Lind, a Hollow Earth theorist, to guide a search for a power source into the Hollow Earth, the homeworld of the Titans. Nathan is initially hesitant as his brother died on an expedition to Hollow Earth due to a strong reverse-gravitational effect. He agrees after Walter reveals that Apex has developed HEAVs, specialized crafts able to withstand the pressure exerted by the gravity field.Nathan meets with Ilene and convinces her to let Kong guide them through the Hollow Earth via an outpost in Antarctica. Nathan, Ilene, and an Apex team led by Walter's daughter Maia board a modified barge escorted by the U. S. Navy that carries a sedated and restrained Kong. Godzilla attacks the convoy and defeats Kong, but retreats after the ships disable their power and trick him into thinking they are destroyed. To avoid alerting Godzilla, Kong is airlifted to the Hollow Earth entrance, and Jia convinces him to enter the tunnel while the team follows him in the HEAVs.Madison and Josh find Bernie, who joins their investigation. They sneak into the wrecked Apex base, discover a secret facility underground, and are inadvertently locked into an underground monorail transport to an Apex facility in Hong Kong, where they unwittingly stumble on a test of Mechagodzilla. It is telepathically controlled by Ren Serizawa, the son of the late Ishiro Serizawa, through the neural networks from a severed head of Ghidorah, but is hobbled by its power supply's limitations. Walter intends to harness the Hollow Earth's energy to overcome Mechagodzilla's limitations.Inside the Hollow Earth, Kong and the team find an ecosystem similar to Skull Island. They discover his species' ancestral throne room, where they find remains of an ancient war with Godzilla's kind and a glowing axe made from another Godzilla's dorsal plates. As they find the power source, the Apex team sends its signature back to their Hong Kong base despite Ilene's protests. Attracted by Mechagodzilla's activation, Godzilla arrives in Hong Kong, and sensing Kong, he directly drills a shaft to the throne room with his atomic breath. In the ensuing mayhem, Maia and the Apex team attempt to escape but their HEAV is crushed by Kong. Kong, Ilene, Jia, and Nathan ascend to Hong Kong, where Godzilla and Kong battle. Godzilla is initially overpowered by Kong, but Godzilla emerges victorious while Kong loses consciousness.Madison, Josh, and Bernie are caught by security and taken to Walter. Despite Ren's concerns over the power source's volatility, Walter orders him to activate Mechagodzilla. They lose control of Mechagodzilla, who kills Walter and electrocutes Ren, and then attacks Hong Kong. Godzilla and Mechagodzilla battle, but Godzilla is overwhelmed. Nathan revives Kong by destroying the HEAV, and Jia convinces him to help Godzilla. As Mechagodzilla overpowers both Titans, Josh short-circuits Mechagodzilla's controls with Bernie's flask of liquor, momentarily interrupting the mech. Godzilla supercharges Kong's axe with his atomic breath, allowing Kong to destroy Mechagodzilla. Madison, Bernie, and Josh reunite with Mark Russell, while Godzilla and Kong acknowledge each other before the two go their separate ways. Sometime later, Monarch has established an observation post in the Hollow Earth, where Kong now rules.","10","paul-86810"," Absolutely Great.

"662","Every human is so one dimensional and implausible that I can't even begin to understand the nature of this film. Where did eco-terrorist Alan Jonah go to? He took the Ghidorah skull from the last movie and then suddenly someone else gets it? Why is Dr Mark Russel even in this film? He does literally nothing in three different parts of the planet. Why does Ilene Andrews call after Jia when she runs off? She's DEAF! Why is Maya Simmons in this movie? She's the disposable daughter of the mad genius who displays no talent at all and dies off camera.Let's ignore the sheer human deaths in the thousands in every major act. Yet in every film to date, these awful parents allow their children to interact with titans. Usually when it's raining. Let's forget that children are able to walk inside not one, not two, but three highly sophisticated and guarded locations without interference. Plus they hitch a ride into some kind of mag-lev container which is transporting eggs we never hear about again and has a display in MPH even though it's an Hong Kong craft. The only thing this film does better than Godzilla: King of the monsters is there's fewer scenes with rain. But there's still a ton of rain. Why? I don't know.Why did they need Kong to ""lead"" them into hollow earth. They already had a reinforced cave leading to it. Kong didn't do anything except fall through a wormhole unscathed. While the humans needed three anti-gravity spaceships to travel there. And of course the debunked defamed author Nathan Lind is somehow also a pilot who once safely back home decides to stay airborne to watch the Titans battle it out instead of getting far away like a sane person might do. And this magical author/pilot found the single switch on the control panel which turns it into an ape defibrillator. And sure, chain up a titan on a transport boat but let's rig up a single lever to let him go. Hey, here's an idea, let's upload the essence of a dead hydra skull brain into a robot's energy source.Let's talk about how every light source in the facilities, crafts and bases plus all the buildings are lit in neon trim like they looted the set of TRON:legacy. How come Apex needed this mysterious energy source from Hollow Earth and when they take a small sample, they only thing they needed was math to recreate it? Did you know all you need to interrupt a satellite uplink into an unguarded control room is a half flask of booze poured on the cooling fan? I didn't, but the randomly Australian comic relief did.There's hardly a hint of blood from either monster even though Godzilla rakes its claws deep into Kong's flesh multiple times and both are dragged face-first into glass and steel buildings. Kong is also a master axe-man who uses the blade as a tool, a key and a shield.I could go on and on about this film but I am exhausted. If only someone could fly a tiny spaceship into my chest and restart me.","1","mikebellman-497-799488"," Rain, roars and retro lights

"663","The special effects in this movie are great and Kong looks really alive.But my God, what an unbelievable stupid storyline in which really nothing makes sense.In a movie like this you know that realism is far away but this movie is nr 1 in unrealism.For instance going down in mother earth and the gravity reverses (WTF?) in a second crushing evrything going through. But Kong has no problem with it and the same for the humans in some kind of aircraft: ask a fighter-pilot what it feels like to pull 3G or more. And try to do it without a pressure-suit.....
And than a whole world in the core of the earth?Please, only make a dumb movie about Godzilla but not something stupid like this movie with Godzilla and Kong together.The great special effects saved the movie a little bit and that's why I rated it a 5 but that is in fact to much....

"664","""Godzilla vs. Kong"" is the fourth film in Legendary Pictures' ""MonsterVerse"" and the fourth Godzilla film produced in the west. Starring Millie Bobby Brown, Julian Dennison, and Alexander Skarsgård, it delivers exactly what it says on the poster - a pair of iconic monsters duking it out in the most epic way possible ...and very little else.Sometime after the events of ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"", the giant ape Kong is being kept under surveillance inside a large simulated habitat, forming a bond with a deaf girl who communicates with him through sign language. One day, Godzilla attacks a city in Florida for seemingly no reason and this sparks an international debate over whether or not these huge monsters are a threat to humanity's future. A team of experts soon deduce that Godzilla was actually tracking Kong's energy signal and decide to transport him somewhere secret in an effort to prevent the two of them from fighting each other and causing even more collateral damage.When it comes to giant monster movies, you can't go too wrong with the ones featuring the undisputed king of the monsters himself - Godzilla. Since 1954, this giant reptilian has been stomping his way through cities battling various monsters of similar size with his brute strength and trademark atomic breath. Every time I hear Godzilla's signature roar, it gives me chills like the first time hearing a lightsaber turning on in ""Star Wars"" or the DeLorean from ""Back to the Future"" reaching 88 miles per hour. Likewise, the enormous gorilla Kong has also had his fair share of time in the spotlight, debuting all the way back in 1933 in the classic film ""King Kong"". With this in mind, it seems fitting that these two iconic titans of east and west should face off against each other at some point, having previously done so in 1962's ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"". Now in 2021, we have a brand new reimagining of such a rivalry, complete with better special effects and destruction galore. There's something so mindlessly satisfying in seeing giant monsters beating the hell out of each other while leaving heavy destruction in their wake. I guess it's all just part of the entertainment value we can take away knowing it's all in good fun and that we can be thankful such colossal creatures don't exist in real life. However, if you are expecting to be treated to anything else beyond this, you will be greatly disappointed. Regardless, if fighting monsters and gratuitous demolition of skyscrapers is what you crave, then this movie certainly delivers.In addition to this, the film also touches on the mythology of these strange beasts (known as ""Kaiju"" in Japanese), with particular focus placed on Kong and his origins. I'm no expert on Kaiju lore or anything like that but I did enjoy that we got to see how these towering figures aren't evil beings with a lust for destroying everything, but rather neutral parties trying to establish their place at the top of the monster food chain. Of course, the level of neutrality varies for each of the two, with Kong perhaps being ""True Neutral"" and Godzilla being ""Chaotic Neutral"". For example, Kong is seen attempting to live peacefully on Skull Island under the pretense that he is in charge and nothing else can take that away from him. Later on, when Godzilla arrives to challenge this notion, an all out brawl ensues, much like how predator animals like big cats would fight one another to establish dominance. We are informed it has been like this for thousands of years and that human civilisation has only popped up recently, just being on the brink of learning how to co-exist among all this ongoing conflict.There's not much to say about the film's human characters, as they are only there to help move the small remnants of the plot along. Most of them were either generic military personnel marked for death or scientific minds trying to make sense of all this madness. I suppose Millie Bobby Brown was the only actor in the film with some dimension to her, as anyone who saw 2019's ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" will recall her character and her importance in that story. I did also like the film's scenes with the deaf girl talking to Kong via sign language, as this reminded me of the famous gorilla Koko who was taught how to communicate with her trainers through similar means. In spite of all this, by the end of the movie, I couldn't recall a single name of anybody other than the titular monsters, remembering them by the actor's real names instead of their characters. At the same time though, it didn't really matter because at the end of the day we don't pay to see a giant monster movie for the human characters for the same reason we don't go to McDonald's to order a filet mignon. Godzilla and Kong's names are in the film's title and it should be obvious by now that they are the real stars here, not the humans.As far as giant monster movies go, ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" does a serviceable job at entertaining us with frequent action and great special effects. It's mind numbingly simplistic but I wouldn't expect anything less. At this stage, it is unknown if there will be any more films in this ""MonsterVerse"" but I do see potential in the franchise continuing for as long as the demand is there. Since there are still plenty of threatening monsters out there to be dealt with, I remain hopeful.I rate it 6.5/10","7","MrDHWong"," Delivers exactly what it says on the poster - a pair of iconic monsters duking it out in the most epic way possible ...and very little else

"671","This is the clearest evidence of how Hollywood can destroy great movie icons. Unable to make a decent film about Godzilla, they decided to destroy the two great cinema monsters with the bonus that Mechagodzilla's fantastic robot is reduced to a cockscrew. If I pay a ticket to see the film I want the story to be honored: Godzilla has features that we hope to see film after film. I don't ask for much. But the untalented people who made the film came up with the idea that it was better not to play Godzilla's music. I thought of Star Wars without it´s iconic music. It's the same. An aberration. On the other hand, the humanization of King Kong is unbearable. Uncomfortable, worried, it makes it nauseating to see the great King Kong turned smart gorilla who can communicate with his little friend. Since when did King Kong stop liking blondes? The humans who star in the plot are also unbearable. The boy, the particular reason I hated Deadpool 2 now achieved the impossible: that he hated American movies about monsters with an inclusive cast. Of the others only one sentence: I wanted them all dead in the first frame. Everyone, their parents and their grandparents. I wanted everything to explode in the film, and in the final fight they would wipe out humanity, starting especially with those involved with the production of this slug, this crap, this cinematographic insult. Finally: Godzilla has no neck and has a microcephalic head. I don't know who came up with it that this is how the king of monsters should look. Godzilla for that anatomy couldn't even look to the side without having to rotate the body. King Kong using weapons is as if it were an extension of past films with apes conquering the world inaugurated by Charlton Heston. No Hollywood, don't do it anymore. Stop doing garbage. Stop insulting our intelligence and pockets. Stay away from this movie at all costs, well-shot fights aren't worth everything behind and around them. If you want to watch a decent movie, just watch the ones made in Japan or Pacific Rim.","1","dasa108"," Giant crap

"675","""Godzilla vs. Kong"" is a weak film with a bad script. Two of the most important monsters in the film history together in a movie, some good things and a lot of problems. The good things are the beautiful visuals, correct performances, an amazing music score, tribute scenes to the original ""King Kong"" film and to the ""Gojira"" franchise, and the best point is that this film is saving movie theaters around the world from bankruptcy after the current COVID-19 pandemic but it is not enough. The bad points are the fake special effects and an awful scrift full of inconsistencies and stupid jokes, it is like an episode of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" mixed with a telenovela episode and an episode of ""Thundercats"", this may be interesting but in this production is a failure. A really bad film!","2","jp_91"," A waste of time!

"676","I was pretty stoked for this movie after seeing the trailer. Figured it'd be a solid arthouse horror picture a la A24 type deal. This is coming from a guy who mostly prefers the B stuff but i enjoy me a good arthouse indie flick now and again.But gee the two main characters were so flat and boring. Like, they couldn't add banter? Find interesting things to talk about while traveling through the woods. I miss the days in horror, and maybe this still happens from time to time, where characters have these very interesting attributes. An example, in del toros chronos, ron pearlman's character was obsessed with the size of his nose and getting a nose job. It was such an interesting tid bit. In this film there was none of that. The characters just flatly said things that were part of the plot. No banter. No conversations. Just ""this is why i'm here"". ""this is what i'm doing"". ""why are you doing this?"" ""oh that's why"".Then a bunch of weird plot stuff, indecision in what the movie is supposed to be. Wicked cool trippy cinematography type stuff that was completely ruined by the entire plot of the movie. A bad explanation about why everything is the way it is.Also the movie alludes to some kind of quarantine at the beginning. Not the one we're in rn i don't believe. But i think the writer thought that this would give it an air of mystery and apocalyptic dread. I think a movie like Monster, a sorta apocalyptic monster film that sorta followed a few people roaming through the forests did this concept well. In The Earth, however, did not. Just felt meaningless and pointless and was just an excuse for non-dialogue that thes indie filmmakers like so much.The last 20 minutes was kinda coool. But not worth what you put into it. I really wanted to walk out of this one.","4","davidmalaimo"," waste of time

It got to the point where I needed to squint in the theater so my eyes weren't flashing.Also, I'm fine with movies that have vague endings but oh my God this did nothing to wrap up their horrible journey in the forest.

"684","Greetings again from the darkness. Have you ever wondered why they warned concert attendees to stay away from the brown acid at Woodstock? I can only speculate, but I assume the poor souls who consumed the taboo drug experienced hallucinations not dissimilar to watching this latest from writer-director Ben Wheatley. Filmmaker Wheatley previously delivered such interesting and diverse fare as the intriguing horror film KILL LIST (2011), the confusing and bizarre HIGH-RISE (2015), and my personal favorite of his, the quite funny and action-packed FREE FIRE (2016).Martin Lowery (Joel Fry, YESTERDAY, 2019) is sent to track down a doctor whose research may provide desperately needed help in fighting a virus that has wreaked havoc on the human race. Martin himself has been in isolation for four months prior to this mission. He teams up with Alma (Ellora Torchia, MIDSOMMAR, 2019), a Park Ranger who works out of a Lodge that has been closed for a year due to the pandemic. She will act as his guide on the 2 day hike through the dense forest to find the doctor.As you would expect, the hike doesn't go smoothly, and things turn very weird and dangerous when Martin and Alma cross paths with Zach (Reece Shearsmith, HIGH-RISE, 2015). He's the ex-husband of Dr. Wendle, the one Martin and Alma are in search of. However, Zach is off the grid and off his (proverbial) rocker. He converses with the forest, which might possibly be his most normal action.Dr. Olivia Wendle (Hayley Squires, I, DANIEL BLAKE) is finally located, and though she and Martin know each other, she seems quite intent on finishing her research in the forest. Back at the Lodge, Alma had filled Martin in on a local folk tale ... the Spirit of the Woods, named Parnag. Most just call it, ""the thing in the woods."" Are we to believe nature is evil, or is nature just fighting back against humans?Written by Wheatley last year, the film shows the effects of a pandemic on some people and how trying to solve things through science may fall short. Paranoia, distrust, dread, and isolation from others are all at play here - and quite in line with our current state. A supernatural element hovers, but the psychedelic images keep us disoriented, and seem to exist for the sole purpose of visual effects. The strobes are so strong they could trigger responses from sensitive viewers, and if they don't, the gore likely will. Cinematographer Nick Gillespie and composer Clint Mansell are standouts here, and though Wheatley is to be commended for his quick work, the film didn't really click for me. Perhaps the two best comparisons are THE HAPPENING (2008) and the far superior ANNIHILATION (2018).In theaters April 30, 2021.","5","ferguson-6"," Wheatley in the woods

There is a warning at the beginning of the movie that says something like,'If you are photosensitive to strobe lights, this movie contains scenes that might trigger an epileptic seizure.' Ooohhhh, scary! It turns out to be more like the Blair Witch movie-an effort is made to scare you but not much is actually there. Joel plays a scientist that is traveling into the woods to meet an old colleague of his, Hayley, who has not been heard from in quite a while. She was supposed to have been working on some kind of virus cure but that's not the case. Ellora is the park ranger leading Joel into the woods-he might get lost, otherwise-when they run into Reece, who appears to have been living in the woods for a little while, himself, and has his own agenda going on. The epileptic causing scenes are mostly strobe lights going off that Hayley has set up for her experiments-she also has loud speakers attached to trees but it's just really loud noise.It's rated ""R"" for violence, grisley images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.I would not buy this movie on DVD.

I don't want to give too much away with the story as I think it's best to come in blind on this one as I did. My main complaint is with the ending. It felt very abrupt and I was scratching my head a little as I left the theatre. However I don't answers should always be handed to the viewer on a silver platter and I'm sure the filmmaker wants the audience to contemplate the film afterwards, which I definitely have been. It would have been nice to get a bit more pay off though. If you are a fan of films like Annihilation or The Witch I think this will be right up your ally.

Torture For Much Of The Movie
An Artistic, Ambiguous Ending that lacked sustenanceThe Review:These movies can sometimes have some of the most unique camera work in the business and this movie lives to that trend. In The Earth dwells in the woods and the budget of this film seems to have made them think of the best ways to add creepy setting to the film. It succeeds well with the use of shadowy lenses, obscure angle, use of night time setting on cameras and multiple shots that help maximize the feeling of being alone in this odd situation. With the sound editing that goes with it, the feeling of being isolated in the woods, especially these woods, helps assist with adding that creepy atmosphere that really is the scariest part of the movie for this writer. It's certainly a more unique approach to the scary story and the premise itself upon presentation is surprisingly different compared to the usual arsenal of demons, specters, and sources of terror that the horror genre has used for years. Thus, those looking for the unique movie will get that aspect in the film, especially that creepy atmosphere that gets under your skin. Outside of the cinematography, the movie has many elements that add to the factor of skin crawling and wincing that these types of films can bring. The unknown mystery of the forest helps start things off, the promise of hope and dismay lingering in the woods constantly fighting for balance really setting the stage for an anything can happen attitude. Once things heat up, the movie starts to mess with the psyche of the audience as weird sounds start to emerge, random events happening in the night, and vague terminology and lore interweave to give an uncertainty that is uncomfortable, but at the same time alluring. Yet, the final layer that comes with it is the ""villains"" in this film, whose actions and odd behaviors are really the most uncomfortable parts of the film. Without giving too much away, what those in the woods are willing to do to fulfill the plan are quite disturbing, and some of the scenes really made me cringe and scrunch in my seat at the horrors being unleashed.In regards to the acting, the movie again gets props for another fine performance in this very vague role with characters whose layers are very limited in the grand scheme of this artistic movie. Joel Fry hits the central role well, awkward, hopeful, and plays tired very well given all the states of mind his character was going to be required to play. While not the most spectacular role for Oscar winning, he does not overact nor simplify the role and keeps the realism in check quite well. Ellora Torchia helps add a little more strength and diversity to the role, bypassing the neutral tones of her counterpart and providing more of the emotional diversity he film needed. She definitely keeps the plot moving and acted as a stronger character for me to follow than the others who hit this role. As for Shearsmith and Squires, they nail the awkward atmosphere quite well in both physical and nonphysical acting. The way they deliver their lines always conveys there is more than they are telling, and just the mannerisms alone are enough to convince you there is more beneath the surface than you might expect.But that's where the good ends for me and the limitations start to arise for this off the path horror movie. For one thing, the backstory is pretty lacking, a small amount of snippets here and there built into casual conversation. The synopsis talking about the virus plaguing the world (sound familiar) is only a minor plot component and the expedition to find the cure is really more of a façade than anything else. Character backgrounds, the true nature of the binding force, even the inclusion of a few others characters are all diluted plot components that did little to impress me given the promise the film held. This may seem minor to some, but it sort of affects the pacing of the film, which despite a slow build up, was very off kilter at times as the movie proceeded. Sometimes very slow and drawn out and other times moving at breakneck speed, In The Earth fails to find its rhythm, struggling to pick a plot to keep the show on the road and keep the suspense going.Instead the focus seemed to be on the presentation and effects of the force that lurked in the woods. One aspect was the flashing imagery/strobe light effects that this movie was all about portraying throughout most of the movie. Annoyingly bright white light flashes with obnoxious sounds fill many sequences in this film, and can potentially cause headaches, migraines, and of course epileptic seizures. They did have the foresight to warn you, but take it from this reviewer and really think about seeing this film if you have any of these effects as this effect is very favored. The other gimmick that comes in is the torture and not the kind like Saw with clever games of traps and survival, but merely torture for the sake of enjoyment. This is not up my alley, and though there was a semi plot component to it, the conflicting duality of the antagonists with the vague plot components left little purpose for the detailed, drawn out mayhem this film relished in. About 20-30 minutes of this film could have been edited out from this slow bout of torture and crushing of the human soul and spent on character development and plot development instead. Some will say this is a good artistic direction, and to that I can nod some respect towards, but at the cost of the other elements, I can't say I'm happy with the sacrifices made in the sake of artistic display. This is especially true with the ending, which if you look at the picture for the poster... sort of gives things away sadly. Much like many choices in the movie, the big ending went down the same obscure feeling that involved drawn out use of flashing lights, some darker themes, and few answers to the overall goal of this movie. Those who like the head scratching endings that make you think will again enjoy this, but for those who like feeling mostly complete at the end of the film, don't your hold breath on that element.The VERDICT:Overall, the movie succeeds in blazing a new type of trail that defies the normal tread path of the genre. With an open to interpretation plot full of mystery and curiosity, a creepy realistic setting, cinematography that works, and some legitimate acting are the foundations to anchor to during this rocky ride. Yet the artistic approach to making this film, while impressive and unique, is not the most entertaining or sensible use of time. The uneven pace makes the movie feel long, and the drawn out scenes of torture, inhumane tactics, and more focus on the obscure flashing vs. The sensible. Without a plot to tie it together and make the whole thing sensible, a lot of this artistic features did not seem needed when it could have led to much better storytelling, which I like. Without the complete ending, and failing to deliver on the potential this film had to offer, this movie is definitely not the new edge thriller I had hoped. Thus, recommendations for this film are low for a theater visit and not much more for a view at home especially given the flashing lights effects. Therefore my scores are:Horror: 4.0
Movie Overall: 2.5-3.0.","4","rgkarim"," Does This Movie Belong In The Earth?

"701","There was so much I loved about this art haus horror film. I appreciated the plot and call-out to alchemy, shamanism, and the forest as a deity who is desperate to send a message to humans. The cinematography was beautiful and captured what can be described as the ""brain"" of nature, with flashing synapses both ephemeral and eternal all at once, combining cyclical nature with the man-made flashes of photography. I loved the air of mystery and dread behind it, and the sound design certainly added to that. My critique is that the film felt a little drawn out; it could have been cut down. However, I saw this at Sundance, so it could have been a rough cut.

This was AMAZING.A modern folktale on the relationship with humans and nature and the fight to be harmonious when it'll never happen.Words cannot explain how CRAZY this movie is. The editing, the visuals, but most of all the SOUND. The score and the sound effects in this are just next level. Half of the movie consists of some of the most insanely annoying yet most uncomfortable things you've ever heard. They're literally just frequencies and noises but after hearing them it's just stuck in your head.The visuals...wow the visuals. 3 different scenes caused me to completely cringe and I NEVER cringe at body horror. Never have, except for those 3 scenes. I have 0 clue how they caused it to be so realistic...so visceral
Also the editing and the psychedelic-inspired (obviously) make you feel like you took a handful of mushrooms (pun intended, if you've seen the movie). It's utterly mesmerizingThe story is very interesting as you're dropped into basically the middle of a story. A pandemic is happening, 2 researchers are missing, a scientist and a park ranger are going to find them.That's when Martin ends up where he is at the beginning of the movie. After that, the sh!tshow begins.I almost thought Olivia was gonna be good, ALMOST. As soon as I heard her and Zach were once together though, I knew for a fact she was gonna be crazy as hell too.This movie shows no matter what side you're on, scientific or not, you can go mad with the search for answers.The amount of inspirations in this movie is a LOT.

Then escape and rescue, but into something maybe worse.So I'm sorry. I didn't get it. The performances were actually very good.

The middle is slightly more interesting but not by much. The last of the movie is almost unwatchable and pure torture. They blare loud sounds and awful music that were ear rape then had a strobe light effect that nearly made me vomit and triggered a splitting headache (there's a special place in hell for the person who thought that effect was a good idea); this goes on and on until finally and thankfully this boring slog of a movie ends.

"711","""Can you feel him now? In the earth?""***To hook your attention, me (Sawyer), a person who is rarely shook, was kind of freak out by this movie***Hi! It's been over a week and I have not stopped thinking about In the Earth. As the world searches for a cure to a disastrous virus, a scientist and park scout venture deep in the forest for a routine equipment run. Through the night, their journey becomes a terrifying voyage through the heart of darkness, the forest coming to life around them. Ben Wheatley is typically a hit or miss kind of director. I've only seen Free Fire so I can't really expand upon this. In the Earth premiered at Sundance this year, however, we decided to skip it considering most people's thoughts on Wheatley's movies. Many are considering this to be a return-to-form movie. And many are saying this is the worst movie they've ever seen. After seeing this opening night, I immediately went back to the theater the next day because it stuck with me so much and I needed answers. In the Earth will not be everybody and probably won't resonate with most, but I found a lot to like with it. The premise is quite simple in setup. We get this eco-horror eerie feel and we know something bad is going to happen. Though Wheatley put out a list of movies that inspired it and Annihilation, Midsommar, and The Ritual (which I actually watched right after seeing this) weren't included, they all had to have been. They are similar in concept and style. For some, the beginning will feel slow but I think it goes by pretty fast. Slowly it grows into something more terrifying. By the end, everything breaks loose. It has one of those endings that is absolutely chaos to the point you don't know what to think of it. The whole time I was gripping the arms of my seat. Intensity works in its favor and Wheatley knows how to get to your core whether it's through visuals or sound design.The small cast does a great job, you can't deny that. We're with Martin (Joel Fry) and Alma (Ellora Torchia) for a significant amount of the runtime. If they're attached to any horror projects in the future I would love to see them. We've seen Torchia in Midsommar before and she proves to take acting to the next level. She's by far my favorite part of the whole movie. Fun fact: In the Earth was conceived, written, and produced all during quarantine. They actually shot the movie over a course of 12 days (I believe) so when you see the final product it's amazing to see what was all accomplished. There are a few technical aspects that could've used some fine tuning. Two cameras were used during shooting. One of them has really nice quality and the other looks like it was shot on iPhone. Not very often are those shots used but it's very noticeable and sort of distracting at times. Also, a few times the editing didn't necessarily work and there's seconds of black screen when it could've easily gone straight to the next shot. As story goes, I like it. Some of the dialogue isn't as good as it could be but I can live with it. My biggest concern with the story is what it has to say. Wheatley has a message to be said about human and nature, but it's not clear enough to see what exactly he wants to say. And when it comes to the demonic nature of the story, not much is clarified, which is where some audiences didn't like it. Part of the reason I went to see it again was to figure out what was actually happening, especially towards the end. I now know a little more than I did on first viewing, but I still am not sure what actually happened. I'd love for Wheatley or someone to digest everything so we can have some clarity to what it all means.Now you can learn why this freaked me out a bit. The movie is designed to make you feel disoriented. Before it starts, there's a message on the screen explaining how there's a significant amount of flashing lights that could be a concern to those prone to epileptic episodes. I love the use of flashing lights because you get some amazing visuals, but I thought I was going to have a seizure. Adding to this, there's also a constant droning bass to make you feel uneasy. Part of the story has to do with the connection from humans to ecosystem using lights and bass. Plants do communicate through frequencies using their roots and that's how the score is built. Clint Mansell crafted an excellent score to make it feel both like a midnight movie and get you on edge. Back to the bass, there's that and feedback that's extremely loud. Some moments I thought my eardrums were about to burst. The sound and flashing lights are so intense and effective that about half of the people in the theater (granted it was about 10 of us) left. The editing (not the bad stuff I mentioned before) for the ""horror"" scenes and especially the end are very fast cut and well edited to further this effect. I left the theater feeling like I was going to be sick. Rarely do you get this kind of experience with a movie. The story isn't that scary where most of my fear came from that. It's all with how it makes you feel. I saw this in a fancy theater with a bigger screen, louder sound, and all that jazz. I'm not sure how you could watch this movie in your house on a TV. Really, In the Earth is meant to be seen in a theater. Most theaters aren't playing the movie solely because it's an indie flick that most haven't even heard of, so the opportunity to view this how it should be is very limited. Can I recommend In the Earth? To that I would say it depends on the person. It's a very mixed bag and it all depends on your views of horror and how you handle those effects. I like In the Earth. It's a movie like no other and will constantly be in the back of my head.","7","sweidman-28016"," Unsettling

"712","Ben Wheatley's ""In the Earth"" is to put it simply a psychedelic sensory overload. There are many moments In the film where the use of flashing lights, unbearable sounds, and flashing imagery takes over. For some this will detract from the experience but for others this will just add to the maddening effect of the movie. Almost like miniature nightmare segments that make you incredibly uncomfortable.In terms of plot we finally have a truly interesting pandemic setting! A deadly virus has its grip on humanity and a scientist goes into the forest in hopes to discover a way to communicate with nature. This scientist believes if she can communicate with nature she can discover a way for humans and nature to live peacefully as one. Therefore removing things like viruses from existence. But when her colleagues lose contact with her they send our two main characters into the woods to find her.Our two main characters trek through the woods and eventually stumble upon a man who claims to be able to hear the spirit of the woods. Talking to him. Telling him to do insane things.This man is of course a threat, but our heroes escape him and find the scientist.The scientist is eventually revealed to be working with the madman to complete a ritual. In her mind it's an experiment in his mind a ritual.. they've both gone mad. But all throughout we see shots of mushrooms expelling a toxin into the air as well. And at the beginning of the film it's mentioned that the forest is the home to a spirit.Is it really possible to communicate with nature through light and sound like the scientist believes? Is there really a spirit in those woods controlling the madman? Or is it the mushrooms causing everybody to go insane? There's many ways to interpret the movie. I suppose either explanation could work individually, or simultaneously.One thing that can definitely be said is that ""In The Earth"" is a cinema experience like no other. I can't see it having the same effect at home on your couch. Something about seeing it on the big screen, the visuals were intense and the sounds even more intense.To me the movie is about humanity's relationship with nature. In a time where humanity has become as desperate as ever, to what lengths will we go to, to find meaning and answers. Do the answers we seek even exist? As the mushroom mist nearly engulfs the camp.. our characters agree to perform the ritual/experiment. Displaying humanity's desperation to understand and befriend nature. But the only answer we the audience are given is that humans and nature can never exist together in harmony. One will always destroy the other.10/10.","10","HorrorFreak1997"," A psychedelic assault on the senses.

"713","Just because you're high doesn't mean you can make a movie. Almost had a seizure watching some of the scenes.There's a phrase that perfectly summed up this movie: style over substance. This was pretty much the director got bored in the pandemic, took some drug, then made a random movie with no plot, but to express how high he was.Near the end of the movie, there were a lot of visuals and seizure-inducing flashes that became very annoying. The story was practically nonsense. There's a set up suggesting that there was a pandemic going on in the movie, and there's a stupid folklore about sound and light or something.A horror? Certainly not. I was even remotely scared at all. The overall pace was slow, but since the story was nonsense, this made me bored for a while.If you're high enough you might like this movie. But this style-over-substance stuff is boring and stupid. Definitely not recommend. 2.5/10.","2","Movi3DO"," Almost had a seizure

"720","This was a movie that I'll be honest, jumped on to my radar as something to see for this year thanks to Duncan from The Podcast Under the Stairs. Him and Mr. Watson did a season of Opera Omnia that covered the filmography of writer/director Ben Wheatley. He's a director that I believe I've only seen one of his films at this time, but that one I really liked. For this, I came in blind just knowing it was getting some buzz, that it was horror and getting to see it in the theater. The synopsis is as the world searches for a cure to a disastrous virus, a scientist and park scout venture deep in the forest for a routine equipment run.We start this movie off with someone with a sledgehammer breaking a rock. They are smashing it into tiny pieces and the reason for this, they are creating a booby-trap. One of these placed in the ground and hidden with grass over it. We then shift over to Martin Lowery (Joel Fry) approaching a cabin. As the synopsis states, there is a virus pandemic so they have precautions here. He has to be sanitized before he can enter. There are more tests and checking out his paperwork that is done by James (John Hollingworth) and Frank (Mark Monero).Once everything has checked out, Martin then meets with Alma (Ellora Torchia). She is the park ranger that is going to take him out to the campsite where the experiment is being done. The two meet in a room where on the wall is an old hand drawn picture. There is an entity of the woods that has become folklore according to Alma. The people from the nearby village have reverence for it as it almost seems like a god of sorts. What he sees makes Martin uncomfortable.The next day, the two of them set out. It is a 2 day hike to make the campsite. Things seem to be going good until they're attacked in the middle of the night. They wake up to find the equipment Martin was bringing was taken. Their shoes are gone and most of their supplies. They continue on, but are slowed when Martin steps on a stone that gashes his foot. Their fortunes seem to be looking up when they encounter Zach (Reece Shearsmith), who is living off the land. He takes them, but living out here might have made him a bit crazy. They aren't too far from the camp they're going for and it becomes a nightmare as they try to survive this ordeal.That is where I want to leave my recap for this movie. Where I want to start is giving credit to Wheatley. He wrote and directed this movie all during this COVID pandemic. I think it is quite strategic in what he did here with the writing. He is establishing that it is taking place during a pandemic, but having it out in the woods, he isn't under the constraints there as you would setting it in a city. There is a limited cast, which also helps. It also feels that he research Olivia Wendle (Hayley Squires) is doing out there might help with finding a cure.Taking the setting even farther, I love the idea of the isolation that comes from putting us deep in the woods. Once they are out in the wilderness, it would take too long to get back so most of the time, they're closer to their destination. There is the feeling that they might never be found on top of that. This all builds tension. Making things worse is that you have Zach, who from the beginning we learn that there's something off about him. I don't want to put him down, but at first we just think he's a hermit. These people tend to be a bit off due to lack of human interaction. There is more to him than that though. Wendle has a similar feel. For her though, how long she's been out there, mostly alone has she seeming to descend into madness. I think how far into the woods this takes place builds that feeling of dread in the movie.There is also the idea of this entity in the woods. The moment I heard that, I really started to look for things in the background of shots. I have to give credit to the cinematography here. There are times where I think there could be something there, but it is only for a frame before it disappears. This helps with the atmosphere for the movie for me. We get more about this potential entity from Wendle as well. I like what the reveal is here and there is an interesting idea brought forth that could explain this virus as well. It really makes you wonder if some of things happening later are really happening or we have madness induced by nature and/or isolation.I believe that is enough for the story without going into spoilers. Where I want to shift next then would be the acting. I was excited to see Fry as I've seen him in other things. I think he does a really good job as Martin here. I feel bad for him though as a lot of bad things seem to happen to him. Shearsmith looks great as Zach and I love the character he plays here. Squires is solid as Wendle. The big thing here is that we don't get to meet her until late, but once we do she does a great job in building the atmosphere as well as establishing more of the lore. Torchia is good as well as Alma and the rest of the cast rounds this out for what was needed.I've already said a bit about the cinematography, but I'll double down that this movie is shot beautifully. It does a great job at giving us nature shots that still give a creepy vibe. On top of that, the editing with certain shots helps. We also get some strobe lights later in the movie that adds as well. Aside from that I think the effects we get in the movie are great. They are done practical and are quite brutal. I was cringing quite a few times.Then really the last thing that I wanted to go over would be the soundtrack. It is used masterfully here. The vibe that the music gives to some scenes we are seeing helps to make them feel creepy, even when nothing is happening. We also get some great use of sound off screen like people yelling. The music that is used during the climax also adds on top of this as well.In conclusion, I really dug the concept and the story of this movie. It is taking something that most people in the world are sick of dealing with in a pandemic, but giving us a different look at it. I think the setting of the woods is great for the isolation that comes with it. The lore that is established and built on as the movie goes is great as well. I would say that the acting is really good across the board. The effects, cinematography and the soundtrack all work as well to build the atmosphere that this movie needs. This is one that I plan to rewatch before the year ends to see where it falls. After this first viewing, I'm sitting on it as a good movie.","8","david_rudy_lee"," Atmopsheric Return to Horror for Ben Wheatley

The dialogue is just boring to listen to, even if the actors are believable as ""real"" people having the conversation.Directing-wise it's typical Ben Wheatley (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). There's some gruesome moments in it which, as an old school gore lover, I enjoyed but I need more than that to keep me watching a film, and more than fancy visuals too.Unfortunately I turned it off after 58 minutes because I couldn't stomach watching anymore when time is so short.

"734","First off, let me say that the trailer was a huge disservice to this film. What it advertised was a horror movie of the purest form; man with an axe, body horror, perhaps pagan ritualism? It really sold the movie, didn't it? So how did the final product end up being so damn boring?The movie starts out fine, and although things are dreadfully slow, it sets the scene for act 2. That's where things really fall apart. The movie nosedives off a steep cliff and falls so heavily, I'm surprised focus groups didn't tear this movie to shreds when it was first screened.Who was this movie made for. Exactly? Fans of horror will be sorely disappointed, as there is very little of it to be scared of. Body horror? Bits and pieces (no pun intended). Pagan ritualism? Yes, but it factors very little into the overall film. It's just a mess of a movie that is saved by the great acting and the unnerving musical score, and that's literally it. When the movie ended, I rushed to scrub it from my memory with an actually good film.It's bad, people. Just utterly horrid in almost all respects. It will test your patience, and you will not come out of it better than you went into it. Movies like these are an obvious exercises in creative vanity; make a movie that you know most people are going to hate simply because you can and no one around you tells you just how bad it will ultimately be. It's also an instance where you know that if the critics love it, you know for a fact it's going to be garbage.A waste of time for this viewer.","3","manuelasaez"," Absolute rubbish, as the British would say.

"735","In the Earth (2021) is a recent release the Mrs. And I went and saw in theatres this past Friday. The storyline focuses on a scientist and a Ranger's trip into the forest on a research expedition that goes terribly wrong. They find someone they hope can help them; but as we know in horror, help isn't always what it appears to be. This movie is directed by Ben Wheatley (Kill List) and stars Joel Fry (Game of Thrones), Ellora Torchia (Les Cowboys) and Reece Shearsmith (High-Rise). The storyline for this at first felt a little like Blair Witch until the researchers run into the couple that live in the woods, then this took a drastic turn for the interesting. I loved the scenes with the ax, stitching, the head bleeding special effect, the hazmat suit, the eye at the end and the main character walking with no shoes.

All that is given is a very quick sentence regards a finding.Did I miss it - what was the vital piece of equipment that got taken? It's this sort of thing that raises questions that never get answered.Also, you've just had the stuffing kicked out of you in your sleep, had your gear and shoes stolen, but then immediately accept help from the only person within 30 miles, whose feet happen to be the same size.The film just seems to be at times almost unrelated cuts stitched together which does take any tension out of it, I reckon if this could have been addressed the film would be a much better experience, as it is, it is just an act of observing things happening and waiting for some kind of payoff.Final message is that nature wants to help us if we listen, but on it's terms not ours, hence why the tech couldn't break through.","4","philiprooke"," Going down to the woods again

"756","A successful horror movie should be enthralling enough to suspend any rational reasoning, because, let's face it, logic is seldom found in the genre. Sure sure, there's usually a plausible mystery setting the table, but soon enough the dining tablecloth is pulled out and all hell breaks loose.This is the sink or swim portion of the experience, where audiences are either reeled in or lost to whatever's on Netflix. And though ""In The Earth"" has a lot of loose end, batshit explaining to do, it provides just the right amount of vibrant thrills for a passing grade.There are curveballs a plenty here to swing at, which makes the developing, tangly plotline tough to decipher, but who cares, there's a slinky temptation about the proceedings that just works. What appears to be a pandemic epic, quickly turns into a scientific camping trip that is equal parts Dr. Moreau and Blair Witch. Spoiler: not fun.Science mixes with mythology, wacky experiments are run, relationships are strained, tenting goes awry. Mother Earth, as welcoming friend, vengeful foe or perhaps just a vibrant backdrop, dominates the screen in a rich tapestry of greens and reds, unforgiving terrain, and impenetrable fog. A feast for the eyes, especially the throbbing, pulsing, sporing mushrooms. She breathes!As horror 101 would dictate, we have the bewildered innocents hunted by the psychotic elements. There's another worldly ""Deliverance"" desperation feel here, as our reluctant couple scramble for survival in an ecosystem they can't seem to escape, captured and tormented by a lunatic fringe on a crazy Pagan ritual bender.Joel Fry is especially well cast as the gangly, stumbling, helpless Martin, who spends a good chunk of the adventure trying to avoid various foot problems. Not for the squeamish, these podiatry sequences escalate to comical proportions. That is the sign of horror success: when a guffaw is elicited during what is otherwise considered a most unfortunate circumstance.Filmed economically, with scalpel precision by Ben Wheatley, ""In The Earth"" proves the power behind the less is more aesthetic, especially when clever camera work is employed.The end may be a bit lacking and open ended for those who prefer proper, paint by numbers closure, but hell, the throbbing ride alone is worth the ticket. Recommended unless over stimulation, aurally and visually, proves too disturbing. But then again, this is not the genre for the weak. Buck up!hipCRANK.","8","js-66130"," FOREST FRIGHT

"758","So before the movie got released I've read multiple articles about it. I've even seen somebody writing in a review that it's the best British horror in years. I don't know what the person writing that review taken before writing it, but I want some as well.The movie seemed interesting for about 25 minutes, then I've watched the rest of it as I've already started. I will never get the time I've spent on watching it back.There was literally no plot in the movie whatsoever, nothing made sense at all, as if the director didn't have a clue what he wanted to make in the first place. Acting was also pretty bad. The only good thing about it were gore effects that were top-notch.There was some sort of a virus having its origin in some sort of a fungus so I thought that there will be some kind of people turned in to some kind of fungal-infected monsters, this would make it far more interesting.Just avoid it if you can.

"760","I'm not a fan of horror movies and this film demonstrates why. Despite the cool cover art, there's NO science fiction in this film. They took elements from Alien Covenant, The Happening, Avatar, even 2001 A Space Odyssey, threw them into a blender and presented this stinking pile of trash as a horror film.I challenge anyone to watch and try to make sense of whatever happened during this nearly 2 hour film of people wandering through the forest wailing and screaming. There's no story here, it's simply a ""people walk into forest and stuff happens"" kind of film. We hear about a virus pandemic, but it's never referred to outside of the first act. There is, however, a dump truck full of exposition as the third act begins, almost as if it's a completely different film?! There's little gore and when there is, the characters are miraculously healed and apparently feel zero pain. That's one of the most irritating things about this film: People don't act like people. They are driven only by what the script requires.I'd have surely passed on it had I known it was directed by Ben Wheatley. He seems to have put more effort into the end credits than he did the entire film. How he keeps finding funding is astonishing, considering his past films which range from strange to downright ridiculous. File this one under the ridiculous category.All the theaters might as well stay closed if this is the swill we can look forward to. It's much like a visit to the dentist, when you actually pay for the pain you receive. You can do so many other fun things in an hour and 45 minutes.","2","ToeCutterZero"," Why so many BAD horror movies?

If those movies don't mean anything to you, or if you have come to known the director by some of his more recent productions like 'High-Rise' and 'Rebecca', this will be a confusing and potentially disappointing ride. While this is not a pandemic-flick Ã  la 'Outbreak' I consider it the truest, even the only, depiction of a pandemic-ridden world I have seen to date. The mundane and low key depictions of pandemic coping rituals are fuelling the core value proposition of the film as a dark horror fantasy about our biological mandate to make sense of it all even where there might be no sense to be made.

The movie opens as the world has seen a pandemic (familiar, huh) and scientists are in search of a cure. Just a hint, this has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. A red herring. Then we are emerged in a folkloric tale of environmental horror. Granted, i wasn't overly fond of the flashing lights, but i understood the purpose they served in the plot and they didn't last that long.I have to be honest. I haven't seen this much hatred for a movie since Midsommar and In The Earth did remind me of it. Don't get me wrong, In The Earth is no Midsommar. However, it does evoke that same sense of isolation and otherworldliness that Midsommar was so wonderful with.I gave In The Earth 6 stars. I would've given it more but i didn't care for the ending.

"773","I really enjoyed A Field in England, it's a very experimental movie, and in my opinion it's one of the most underrated art films ever made. So naturally I was excited for this film. So, how is it? Well, I'm not so sure if I'm being completely honest.First of all, I love the concept. I think it's interesting and there's many avenues to go down. Second, most of the acting is great... yes I said MOST. As expected, Reece Shearsmith was fantastic, and I wish I see him more in movies. Whenever he was on screen, I was having an absolute blast. I think the lore side of the ""creature"" is really interesting, but I'll get to the later. This movie is very well shot, and the sound design is pretty great.Here's what I didn't like... I don't like Alma. She's an annoying and boring character, and I don't understand why she's even in the movie. Martin is an interesting enough character. I hated the dialogue at some points. There were a lot of times where I rolled my eyes because of how poorly written it was. Like I side, I enjoyed the lore and worship part of the creature, but the science aspect was boooooooooooring. I don't understand the point of Olivia at all. It would be wayyy more affective if Martin goes out to find Olivia, and turns out Zach killed her. Not only that, it would make more sense. And my biggest complaint with this movie is the lack of ambiguity. One of the reasons why I love A Field in England so much is because of how ambiguous and interpretive it is. And there's none of that here. Every bit of ambiguity is explained away. It's really obnoxious when you have an interesting and cool story, but you explain every bit of interpretation you could have. This could've been a story about Martin coming to terms with death, but instead it's about Alma killing a hobo. It's laaaaaame.Ben Wheatley is just trying to create a more digestible version of A Field in England, but obviously it wasn't as affective as he wanted it to be. I hope Ben Wheatley will try and experiment with weird ideas again, because this was a disappointment. Like I said, there were moments that I loved, but if anything those moments just confirmed why I love A Field in England. Anyway, check this out if you want. I'm giving it a 5/10.","5","foxypoo"," Some parts I adored, other parts... not so much.

"777","An electrifying and spectacular film that through the strength and magic of cinema, denounces the abuses of people who at the time fought for their people and who unfortunately continue to do so, not only establishing itself as one of the best films ever, but managing to be the bearer of profound and devastating messages. The film through the telling of the story manages to shine and to be a real manifesto for the struggle of men who have done everything possible to say ""I am a human and I have a value"", in this case a community of black people who have suffered injustices and abuses without a valid reason. Judas and the Black Messiah is directed by Shaka King with extreme intelligence and tact, with creativity and honesty; excellent choice of the cinematography and music that enhance the scenes and emotions of the brilliant cast (including Jesse Plemons, always a pleasure to see him acting), but above all the impeccable and perfect LaKeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya who lead the film with commitment, honesty and dedication, once again managing to establish themselves among the best actors of contemporary cinema, not only increasing the value of the film, but creating a real acting masterclass. Judas and the Black Messiah is rich in elements that blend between reality and cinema, but in this case is nothing more than a single and well-defined world to be taken as an example and therefore as a purpose to follow, as well as the characters of the true story tried to do.","9","RinoBortone91"," MASTERFUL FILMMAKING CARRING A DEVASTATING REALITY
"
"778","This movie was quite well made. I have read about Fred Hampton before, but the absolute terror of the FBI upon his life was really made clear by this film. Daniel Kaluuya emulated the necessary leadership and charisma to portray Hampton. My only issue with his casting is that he is in his thirties, while Fred Hampton died at age 21. I think this is really crucial to the story- his assassination at such a young age is not a minor detail. I do appreciate that Akua Njeri (known at the time of the film as Deborah Johnson) and Fred Hampton Jr. were consulted for this film, and I think that is clear. While Bill O'Neal takes the forefront as a double agent, Fred Hampton's character is still highlighted and preserved. The ending was absolutely devastating, particularly the choice to include footage of the real Bill O'Neal. I think this film launches an important conversation about being complicit vs. actively harming someone, especially in the context of the Black Power movement. I also think it's important for people to learn about the FBI's assassination of Black Panthers, something which isn't typically taught in history classes.","8","ellagilbert-23101"," relevant

"779","When I saw ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" less than a year ago, I commented that there was likely a more interesting movie to be made about Fred Hampton. Well, here it is! This film avoids all the traps of traditional biopics. Its tight timeline and electric performances distinguished it from similar stories that wind up feeling like nothing more than historical dramatization. I knew how this movie would end. I knew the basic story of the main character. And yet I hung on every moment. Kaluuya is that good, and Stanfield is that good. More importantly, the filmmakers are smart enough to figure out that this could be a story of betrayal, advocacy, loyalty, and fear...something that transcended one person's story. What results is something both universal and uniquely relevant to the present day. This movie deserves whatever awards it wins.","8","cliftonofun"," Universal and unique
"
"780","After seeing The Trial of the Chicago 7, I read about the people involved and came across Fred Hampton's story which really fascinated me. I believe Judas and the Black Messiah did it justice.Judas and the Black Messiah follows Bill O'Neal, a man who becomes an FBI informant to gain inside information on the Deputy Chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party, Fred Hampton.After watching the first trailer, I got goosebumps. Even after repeat viewings of the trailer, I still got goosebumps. No trailer has made me feel like that before and so I was anticipating this film for a long time. This film was unflinching in its portrayal of its events and I loved every bit of it. It may be a disappointment to some as Fred Hampton isn't in the film as much as you would think but I thought showing this story through the perspective of O'Neal was a great choice. Bill O'Neal was an interesting person who did make choices that were questionable and I liked the conflict that built over time between his allegiance to the FBI and the Black Panther Party. Lakeith Stanfield gives one of his best performances here as O'Neal. There are so many layers and nuances in his performance to give an idea of what his character is like. Despite knowing the story, I was still stunned by some of the things O'Neal does and somehow Stanfield still manages to make him somewhat sympathetic by the end.The main attraction here is Daniel Kaluuya who is mesmerising as Fred Hampton. He pulls off the accent brilliantly and adds so much charisma and power to the dialogue by Will Berson and Shaka King. A particular scene where he's speaking to a large group of people is made so powerful by the energy and confidence Kaluuya brings to each word that comes out of his mouth. I couldn't believe this was the same man from Get Out. This is the biggest chance for him to win a Best Supporting Actor award and I hope he does. Jesse Plemons is also amazing here. I'm so happy his career is flourishing. Dominique Fishback is also fantastic and brings a level of emotion to the film.For a second feature, this is really impressive from Shaka King. I see a great amount of confidence in his direction and writing and I'm hoping to see more of him in the future. There are a couple of shootout scenes and its depiction of violence was hard-hitting and held a substantial amount of weight to it. The score is very unusual but at the same time I liked the way it was used in the film.All in all, Judas and the Black Messiah is a powerful film. It brings to a light an important time in history and educates us on someone that wasn't that well known. With striking performances from Kaluuya and Stanfield, this is a film that should be watched.","9","ronakkotian"," Kaluuya and Stanfield are striking in this unflinching film

"781","So let's start with the good. The cinematography and period setting is top notch and really puts you in the era. The acting is very good and helps with holding together a porous story.Now for the bad. I really really wanted to love this movie. But...If you're looking for a biopic of Fred Hampton, this ain't it. Plain and simple. If you're looking for a movie that tells you more than you already knew about an understated important figure in black history, again this ain't it.What you will get is a movie about an FBI informant who's motives are questionable at best, that happens to have Fred Hampton featured in it. If you're not versed in the names of people in Hampton's inner circle, you will be confused and have a hard time remembering who's who, as characters come and go constantly, with virtually no character development.The movie is entertaining for the most part as the acting is quite good. But the story itself is all over the place and some scenes are longer than they need to be. You won't know much more about the great Fred Hampton, than you did before you watched this movie. It's too bad because I was waiting for this one.People will trip over themselves to give this positive marks, but as a student of history and someone who loves a good drama in a period piece, this movie missed a great opportunity for sure.","6","airborne_trooper"," Intriguing but rather shallow

Instead of focusing on what made Fred Hampton such a powerful person - his politics, his words, his analysis - we are forced to sit through a bunch of cop-shoutouts and a fairly shallow version of an informant - FBI relationship story that we've seen done better in plenty of other movies.As for the character of Bill Oneil, who unfortunately becomes the main character of the film, we have no insight into his ideology or his motivations, only that he wants money. The most interesting thing we learn about him is the real footage of the documentary that features at the end - which makes me wonder why I'm not watching a documentary instead. Throughout the film there's nothing about him that makes it believable that he'd be liked, trusted and even integrated as an important person in the Panthers and as a close friend of Fred Hampton's.Overall, pretty lame","5","fdeveaux11"," A poorly developed FBI-Informant relationship distracts from Fred Hampton's story

Don't get me wrong, after all I've read and seen over the decades, I STILL can't say that I know the full Fred Hampton story. But I know THIS film isn't anywhere NEAR a true depiction. This movie here is just trying to get some empathy awards during/before Oscar time based on race and the BLM movement. All that ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" really is is a slow emotional buildup to a black mans assassination. The SAD part is that this film could have easily been about ANY black man, because it never once depicted the true Fred Hampton. The title "" Judas and the Black Messiah"" doesn't even focus on who Bill O'Neal (Judas) was and what his motivations REALLY were. All we know from the ""filmmaker"" is that she views O'Neal as a traitor. Why not tell us why? Because emotion kills logic, so there doesn't have to be any truth OR logic right? If there are any people who are interested in more truth about Hampton or BBP?

"792","I was thinking to myself ""Wow, at last. A new movie that might actually be good."" Boy, was I mistaken, and disappointed. This is pure garbage. What's the point in having actors read lines if barely a word they are saying can be understood?The actors are just mumbling away incoherently. Is there really any point in having dialogue in a script if hardly any of it can be understood? No, there isn't. Why did Hollywood put this garbage out? They do check for this type of thing beforehand, so it's deliberate. Maybe they don't want us knowing what the actors said.Regardless, this movie was only made because of the lunatic woke agenda, and we all know it. If the woke Left hadn't cried ""racism"" so many times, this would not have been made. Or would it? Maybe it would have, but it would have been made by a better director - a competent director. And maybe it would have been made using actors that can read lines that can be understood by the audience.This garbage was nominated for an Oscar? Give me a break. The Oscars have gone the same route the Nobel prizes took: straight down the worthless road to lack of credibility. There's no talent in this movie. Its Oscar nomination was purely politically motivated. This garbage deserves zero praise.","1","ratiocinator"," ""Mumble, mumble."" What the hell are the actors saying?

"793","This is exactly the kind of film that gets an 'empathy' nomination. A half baked, slow paced, poorly made boring film. The execution is just terrible and the story is a less than 5 minute script dragged over 2 long hours. Those rating this film 9's and 10's do y'all have any sense? Rating such a stupid and time waste of a film so highly. The story is nothing we are not aware of, so at least the execution should be good. But gosh, is this the most boring film I've watched! Wasted and spoiled my Sunday watching this horribly made film.This director should not make any note films. He doesn't know what he is doing. The ridiculous shoot out scenes were tedious to get through as was most of the film. The shoot out scenes reminded me of the painful to watch Bollywood gangster movies.

"795","Huey P. Newton, Bobby Seale, Eldridge Cleaver are familiar names in Black Panther historical lore. Fred Hampton's story, however, is not well-known by the general public. This movie rights that travesty. The movie is simply fantastic, well-acted, produced and engrossing from the first frame. Daniel Kaluuya wears this role like a second skin. Whoever says a Brit cannot play an American revolutionary convincingly, can go pound sand. LaKeith Stanfield plays Bill O' Neal, a Judas, with such conviction, it was difficult not to hate his character the entire movie. However, he does manage to muster some sympathy as you see he begins to believe in the Black Panther's cause and is torn between the cause and his deception. Dominque Fishback does a nice job playing Hampton's love interest. Jesse Plemons, as the crooked FBI agent, was appropriately sleazy. Overall, one of best movies so far this year. I hope it picks up some nominations.","10","denise-99445"," Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield Are Fantastic!

"
"799","Given the subject matter, this movie is an unflinching, unvarnished, uncompromising look into the life and revolutionary thought of Fred Hampton.For those who are unfamiliar with Fred Hampton, during the time of the Chicago 7, in the late Sixties, Fred Hampton was the leader of the Black Panthers (not of course to be confused with the recent movie, Black Panther) of Chicago. Long before the term was fashionable, Hampton was able to forge what he called a rainbow coalition with other brown and white revolutionary groups, which no doubt hastened his death. In December 1969 he was shot dead while he sleeping by members of the Chicago Police and FBI. There is no historical disagreement that J. Edgar Hoover personally directed the assassination of Fred Hampton. None of the participants were prosecuted nor even questioned following his assassination.The story is told through the eyes of the Judas, the traitor in the organization, Bill O'Neil, and his FBI handler. In life, O'Niel was Fred Hampton's closest associate, so you can see how deep the FBI was able to penetrate the organization. While there are moments when the movie digresses into Hollywood hokum, on the whole this movie is a sympathetic and accurate portrayal of the revolutionary thought of Fred Hampton. The focus of the film is Hampton's thoughts and dreams. By watching this film you will see the care with which that revolutionary thought was presented on the screen. It is both surprising and gratifying at the same time to see a major studio embark on this project and preserve Hampton's life, memory, and thoughts for a new generation.","10","kaljic"," An Outstanding Portrayal

"806","The tragic story of former Black Panther Party leader Fred Hampton has found a worthy recipient in director Shaka King. In his second feature film, Shaka tells the story of the rise of the young Hampton in Chicago in the late 1960s. The latter is unaware that a member of his own ranks is cooperating with the FBI to put a stop to him and the party.Judas and the Black Messiah is marked by outstanding performances. Lakeith Stanfield acts as the ""Judas"" in the film, i.e. traitor William O'Neal, who is infiltrated into the Black Panther group as a mole by FBI employee Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons) after attempted car theft. The two share a very believable and atypical chemistry that almost makes you suspect a friendship of sorts. The real person behind William O'Neal even said years later that he admired Mitchell. Stanfield is the real protagonist of the film. Large parts are taken up by Daniel Kaluuya as Fred Hampton, the ""Black Messiah"" beloved by many but just as much opposed by many. Kaluuya is tailor-made for this role. He is electrifying, powerful and does not hold back in illustrating his emotions. It is above all Kaluuya's eyes that say a great deal about his character and illustrate the determination Fred Hampton displayed to assert his values. Especially during speeches he lets it all out and combines all kinds of emotional states: suffering, passion and anger towards the ""Pigs"" (racists). Dominique Fishback, as Hampton's partner and mother-to-be Deborah, takes up quite a bit of screen time and displays enormous poetry and passion in her few dialogues. She and Kaluuya also have terrific chemistry.Judas and the Black Messiah is ultimately just a semi-biopic about one of the most significant black freedom fighters in American history. The focus is on O'Neal's betrayal and Hampton's relentless fight against racism and for equality. Besides the superb acting performances, the cinematography and King's atmospheric direction stand out as major strengths. If the film can be criticised for anything, it is that due to its lengthy structure it often fails to find a red thread and gets lost in arbitrary subplots a few times. These have relevance to the main plot, but take up several minutes of the running time. Without Stanfield's authentic acting, his character would lack a lot of humanity, because it is difficult to empathise with him despite him being the protagonist. The exact opposite is the case with Kaluuya, who absolutely dominates and captivates the film. From start to finish, he fills Hampton's big shoes brilliantly, honouring a historical figure who unfortunately flies far too much under the radar. Judas and the Black Messiah is an excellently realised film and communicates important and educational incidents.","9","severindringel"," A well-told story about an important event

"807","My only complaint was for whatever reason the dialogue was super low on HBO Max. Kaluuya deserves an Oscar for his performance.

"818","Bolstered by two powerhouse performances from two of the brightest acting talents working in Hollywood today, Judas and the Black Messiah is a potent & provocative slice of American history that renders the life & legacy of Fred Hampton on film with endless zeal, charged intensity & bracing authenticity, and definitely ranks amongst the first cinematic gems of 2021.Co-written & directed by Shaka King, this biopic is crafted with as much restraint as it seethes with rage and King does a brilliant job at placing & highlighting the issues of the present in this dramatisation of the past. The plot stays compelling, the script retains its sharp edge & King's direction exhibits deft composure from start to finish, plus neat work in other aspects help uplift the narrative even more.The finest aspect however are the performances. Daniel Kaluuya has an undeniable aura about him and his screen presence here makes his commanding performance as Black Panther Party's deputy chairman all the more convincing. Lakeith Stanfield plays the informant whose betrayal leads to Hampston's assassination at the hands of the FBI and his input is just as impressive as Kaluuya. Jesse Plemons is always reliable and he's no different here.Overall, Judas and the Black Messiah packs a raw power & vicious energy which it channels through its sophisticated imagery & skilful storytelling to offer a biopic that not only honours the life of Fred Hampston but also emboldens everything he stood for. An incisive indictment of the oppression & injustice of minorities in America and its corrupt system's incessant need to silence any voice of reason & revolution that rises from the subjugation, Judas and the Black Messiah comes recommended.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","CinemaClown"," Worth Viewing For Daniel Kaluuya & Lakeith Stanfield's Electrifying Acts Alone

Shouts out to the whole cast, crew, director and producers! This is an amazing piece of historical Cinema that does not pull any punches! It is not for the faint of heart and will definitely evoke strong emotions and anybody who is a human being so I would go into this with caution! **spoiler** it is quite sad that it took a 21 year old young man named Fred Hampton sacrificed his life in the quest for unity and equality, and we are nowhere closer to that dream. All of our leaders, we the people, are either dead and gone or weak, cowardly and afraid to make a move. The FBI and all of these government and federal/private organizations that do dirt are the problem. What they did to that young man and the whole Black Panther Party organization that was trying to better communities is absolutely horrible and they should not still be around! William O'Neal died knowing that he made the biggest mistake one could ever make and that is betraying not only his people but a great young leader who could have potentially United the world, all for a piece of change and to save his own ass from 5 years behind a prison cell.

"822","Watching ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" for me was more academic than entertainment. Some years ago I read the Jeffrey Haas book titled ""The Assassination of Fred Hampton,"" so I was apprised of all the events surrounding Fred Hampton's death. More importantly, I went through several stages of anger when reading the book which prepared me for the movie. So, the question for me going in was: how will the movie measure up factually to the book I read?I say that the movie was brilliant. It was a fair and honest assessment of the Black Panther Party (BPP) especially at that time and it was a fair representation of Fred Hampton (played by Daniel Kaluuya). As far as the Judas in this saga, William O'Neal (LaKeith Stanfield), I knew very little about him and I didn't care to know much about him. I knew all I needed to know: he provided the floor plan of Fred's home for Chicago P.D. to bust in and kill Fred in his sleep. Still, ""Judas"" gives the audience a deeper look into the life of O'Neal just before his involvement with the BPP up until the fateful day on December 4, 1969. We get a picture of a confused man who, while working for the FBI, seems to want to help the BPP in its goals. But, in all of his confusion he remains selfish in that self-preservation comes first for him.Fred Hampton, on the other hand, is the total opposite. Self-preservation and selfishness is not a part of his DNA. And what needs to be remembered is that Fred Hampton was only twenty-one when he was killed. He was a bright, charismatic, and sincere young man who accomplished much good and could've accomplished so much more, and I think ""Judas"" did a phenomenal job portraying that.I'm biased, I know. I have an affinity for Fred Hampton and the BPP though I wasn't alive during their reign, so any positive portrayals I'd probably like. Having said that, I still look for accuracy and I've read enough to be able to spot BS. Every movie is going to add dramatizations and an event here and there to increase the drama and I think that's acceptable so long as it doesn't significantly alter the facts. ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" toes the fact-line and also entertains.","9","view_and_review"," I'm Biased, I Know

The story here was very interesting, because we have an African American working with the FBI against his own people. I was not aware of this story, and I was glad to learn about the character of Fred Hampton through this movie.Daniel Kaluuya was so good. Through his passionate acting, he captured the character of Hampton as an electrifying and inspirational orator who genuinely wanted freedom for all people. I enjoyed his presence in every scene he was in. LaKeith Stanfield as the Judas was also good. I bought that he was very reluctant in participating in the operation, and also how scared he was of getting caught.The movie showed the harsh condition and oppression that the FBI had against the revolutionary. The violence and brutality were shocking and unbelievable.My only problem was that I wish I could learn more about the work of Fred Hampton.

"833","Absolutely stellar performances in this film, especially from Kaluuya and Stanfield. Honestly, with the two of them I feel like we're getting glimpses at the future acting stars in Hollywood because I've yet to see either of them in something where they're not delivering. Those two aside, the rest of the cast here is solid as well with no real low notes to speak of. This is an acting film, 100% driven by performances and yet that leads into the reason I don't love it as much as a lot of people seem to. These characters are all so fascinating and I feel like, in an effort to capture the movement going on, the film fails to live with these characters enough. When the credits rolled I felt unsatisfied with the amount of time spent with them and not in a ""Oh my god I could watch another three movies with these guys"" kind of way. So much is happening here that I never felt I got enough time to really focus on the journey some of these people are taking. Stanfield specifically feels like he's on a Donnie Brasco-esque journey of self discovery but rather than moving along in a natural, steady pace it seems like his character jumps from stage to stage in his progression and I so wanted to see more of the turmoil and struggle he was going through.Thinking on that now, I wonder if this would've been better off as a limited miniseries just because there is so much to cover and trying to push it all into one movie doesn't give enough time for all of it. Even a 5 hour long miniseries would've given enough time to really capture all the complexities, the dilemmas facing these characters and I think would've been devastatingly powerful.As it stands, Judas and the Black Messiah feels like a phenomenal display of acting talent but a bit of a misstep in terms of story and plotting and that latter hangup really prevents the strengths of this movie from being as powerful as I feel they could have been. I know I'm in the minority here, I know people are loving this movie and they absolutely should. It's solid and has an very prescient message. I just can't help but wonder about the greatness that could have been. Still recommend everyone watch this. It's worth it. I just didn't find myself swept up into the hype machine.","7","questl-18592"," J and the BM

"839","IN BRIEF: An earnest but flawed exposÃ© with a star turn by Daniel Kaluuya as the Messiah.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) It seems it is more than just documented facts that J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI illegally investigated any Black subversive protest groups during the 60's, with the Black Panther Party as their No. 1 target. Recent films seem obsesses with that matter (One Night in Miami, MLK/FBI, The Trial of the Chicago Seven, the soon-to-be -released The United States vs, Billie Holiday). You can now add to the fold, Shaka King's searing indictment, Judas and the Messiah.This bio-pic tells the true story of Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya), chairman of the BPP, who is ultimately betrayed by an FBI informant, William O'Neal (Lakeith Stanfield). The film chronicles Mr. Hampton's life and death with a searing performance by Mr. Kaiuuya as the doomed crusader. There is no doubt that this performance will be recognized this award season. (More on that later.)We follow Mr. Hampton's journey from to skillful orator to full-blown leader, his sweet relationship with Deborah (Dominique Fishback), and his so-called friendship with William. We also view Mr. O'Neal's involvement in petty crimes and criminal activities before he becomes the stoolie for FBI agent Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons, under the behest of J. Edgar Hoover (Martin Sheen, with heavily applied make-up that borders on buffoonery).The script by Mr. King and Will Berson is a bit of a jumble and skims the surface before presenting its case. The movie allows a more liberal point of view from the filmmakers and crew in retrospect. The director/writer interweaves archival footage to his biographical tale most astutely and knows how to film his action scenes to full throttle effect. He does not shirk from showing the violence from both the police brutality and the Panthers' own militant stance and pro-gun attitude. The director envisions his drama like an unfolding gangster saga, with fluid camerawork and stylish flourishes, although his decision to use an annoying atonal music score just add more injury to one's eardrums. All in all, the film still resonates with its factual baseline and superb acting in general. One cannot discount the redacted facts and the shady cover-up that are now part of historical record.This is an honest but empathetic view of the Black struggle which shows the desperate violent lengths the Black Panthers would go for their cult-like cause which almost seems to justify Hoover's insistence about this group's dangerous origins and his underhanded tactics in taking this group out. But the portrayal of the FBI and their fearful leader is strictly one-dimensional. The Feds are predictable cardboard bad guys that become absurd caricatures rather than real figures. That seriously hinders the film's impact.The film loses much of its momentum whenever Fred's story is pushed aside in favor of showcasing scenes of O'Neal's issues and the FBI arch villainy. The reliable Mr. Pleson is fine as the cold and calculating FBI agent, but Mr. Sheen is miscast as Hoover. Granted, the waxy make-up doesn't help his performance. It only makes him look like a supporting cast member of The Sopranos than J. Edgar. The screenplay would have been wiser to eliminate the physicality of this well known figure entirely.In accurately conveying the 60's era of racial unrest, the main Judas role is underdeveloped. Mr. Stanfield is very good as William and the actor tries to fill in the gaps to this solitary loser, but, as written, O'Neal is more a series of nervous tics and fearful glances than a real person who one cares about.What the film does best is honoring its Black Messiah and his Lady Madonna storyline. As previously stated, Mr. Kaluuya is sensational. His role has more depth and emotional nuance. Mr. Hampton's revolutionary speech after his arrest is totally mesmerizing in its delivery. But it is the film's quieter scenes with Mr. Kaluuya and the captivating Ms. Fishburne that provide the gravitas needed. They are the emotional core. Their final scene is a heartbreaker and staged so powerfully in its straightforward use of graphic violence and human cruelty.Well crafted and skillfully performed, Judas and the Messiah has many strong moments scattered between some scenes of loose and meandering storytelling. It takes a while to build its narrative, but it does so by its tragic end. (GRADE: B-)NOTE: The R&B song during the closing credits, Fight for You, is a real winner. Take a listen.","7","jadepietro"," Looking for a Savior

"841","I'm seeing a lot of black berets in this movie. The problem is, they're not accurate. Clearly the makers of this movie purchased a lot of modern military berets for the film. Unfortunately, these berets are nothing like the berets the black Panthers wore back in the day. Today's military berets have a smaller crown and they're much stiffer, so they need a lot of work to get them to sit right on a person's head. The berets the Black Panthers wore were bigger, softer, and with a bigger crown.Also, Fred Hampton wore hats, but I've never seen any photo of him wearing a black beret. He may have worn one on occasion, but it was clearly not a hat he liked to wear.If the movie makers can't get details like this right, I worry that they'll get other details wrong too. At some point, I hope Fred Hampton gets the movie bio he deserves, but I have doubts that this is it.","5","beeryusa"," What's with all the anachronistic berets?

Though Mary remains a curse word among informed U.S. citizens for ruthlessly slaughtering John Garfield, Ethel Rosenberg, Errol Flynn, Malcolm X, JFK, M.L.King, Jr., Jimmy Hoffa, Norma Jean Baker, Walter Reuther and Bob Kennedy, JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH highlights his assassination of Fred Hampton, 21.

"844","This movie is definitely going on the re-watch list
The title accurately describes the relationship between ""William O'Neal"" and ""Fred Hampton"" for a brief period in the 60's before O'Neal assisted the FBI in killing Hampton.It begs the question ""does the time/moment make the man or is it vice versa""? The probability at the time based on the events happening in the United States with race relations and Edgard Hover (then FBI director) doing everything in his power to orchestrate the deaths of black activist, naturally gave rise to a Messiah ""Hampton"" and a Judas ""O'Neal"" who would betray him.Both Daniel Kaluuya (playing Hampton) and Lakeith Stanfield (playing O'Neal) do a fantastic work embodying their characters and re-enacting them to life. Very much like the carpenter from 2000 years ago 1/3 the world still worships, Fred Hampton was indeed a Messiah that pointed out the hypocrisy in the American system and preached sermons that empowered and brought unlikely factions of people together. He frequently said ""power anywhere there's people"", a wise timeless insight.","9","mrlami"," This movie is definitely going on the re-watch list

"849","This was one of the most moving and well put-together films I've seen. Every moment was expertly paced, Daniel Kaluuyah was absolutely tantalizing, and the score was a perfect mix of fresh and old sounds of blues and jazz- new and old. The wardrobes are immaculate and the color schemes stay in brand in their entirety. At this point Jesse Plemons has played every reproachable human being beyond salvation and his performance here is no difference. His performance is profoundly disturbing.The dialogue is endlessly quotable but what it does as a whole is take the viewer with the Black Panthers into their mission and introduces them to the brotherhood and the community that surrounds the revolution. Many scenes make it easy to humanize and love the Messiah, showing Fred in his everyday life, steadfast and incorruptible. The love and spirit extending through the Panthers makes it even more reprehensible that someone like Bill (Lakeith Stanfield acting his face off) could remain a rat for so long. Themes touch upon racism, systematic oppression, and the duality of individual survival versus community good.This is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen. The acting was amazing from all angles and there was not a single moment that felt lacking in suspense or sentiment. I left feeling sad and angry at America's recent and shameful history but also inspired to learn more about the history of the Black Panthers and the immense sacrifices they made as a group and as individuals.An example of the comedic timing punctuating the film: during opening minutes

"850","Both are based on the true story which happened in Chicago in 1968 and 1969, so two movies give the whole picture of what it was like in Chicago in late 60s. Social oppression, protest in reaction, police's excessive force of use, discrimination against the weaker are the words to describe atmosphere around that time. It's interesting to compare and contrast how Fred Hampton is realized in two movies. Other than that, there are many things to compare and contrast both contents and the forms.'Judas and the Black Messiah' is disappointing that the director could have done so much more with such an important historical figure (similar with 'The Trial of the Chicago 7'). The screenwriting is stretched and elongated. The momentum and the tension have to be built up for December 4th Monroe Massacre where all the powerful emotions burst. However, the director fails not only to build up but also to have a great ending.P.S.

"856","For years I had heard about Fred Hampton. As a community organizer in 1960s Chicago, he was influential in uniting various groups in an armed struggle. Not surprisingly, this made him a prime target of the police.Shaka King's ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" focuses both on Hampton and on William O'Neal, a car thief hired by the FBI to infiltrate the Black Panthers. What the movie really introduced me to was the passion with which Hampton gave his speeches in calling for revolution, as well as how the FBI manipulated O'Neal into betraying Hampton.Daniel Kaluuya gives an outstanding performance as Hampton. His fiery orations make you feel as if you're present in his audience. The rest of the cast is mainly there to support him, namely LaKeith Stanfield as O'Neal. Nonetheless, it's an excellent movie, showing the power of one the US's most important political movements, and the government's aim of crushing it (make no mistake: J. Edgar Hoover - played by Martin Sheen in the movie - was a truly evil person). As Hampton said, you can kill a revolutionary, but you can't kill the revolution.","10","lee_eisenberg"," the revolution will stand
"
"857","Fred Hampton was only 21-years-old when he was murdered by Cook County police in an illegal home raid in 1969. He was drugged with a sedative to prevent him from fighting back and shot twice in the head while sleeping in front of his nine-month pregnant partner, Deborah Johnson.Even though he died young, Hampton had already accomplished more than many of us could ever dream. As chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party, Hampton founded the multicultural organization, the Rainbow Coalition, and allied his party with other Chicago groups in an effort to end street violence and instigate social change. He was a born leader and speaker, moving hundreds with his words at the protests and educational courses he led.Now, after fifty years since his untimely death, Hampton is getting the biopic treatment in ""Judas and the Black Messiah"".The British-born Daniel Kaluuya portrays Hampton in a performance that can only be described as electrifying. Kaluuya has already made himself known with his lead performance in Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" and a supporting turn as a sadistic hitman in Steve McQueen's ""Widows"". Here, Kaluuya elevates his game even further as he channels both the powerfulness Hampton carried in public and the tenderness he had in private. There isn't one second you're not glued to him while he's on screen. An Oscar nomination is bound to happen and a win would be deserved.Playing Judas to Hampton's Black Messiah is LaKeith Stanfield (also in ""Get Out"" as the brainwashed Andre King). Stanfield plays William O'Neal, who was a petty Chicago criminal who became an informant for the FBI as he rose the ranks within the Black Panthers. O'Neal was the one that sedated Hampton in exchange for $200,000, an act he never considered a betrayal. Stanfield rises close to the level of Kaluuya as he gives a twitchy and layered performance that is nothing short of a career-best.Directed and co-written by Shaka King, ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" meets both criteria of a biopic, which is to be both entertaining and informative beyond the top-layer Wikipedia facts. We learn about Hampton through O'Neal, as we watch him ascend from the bottom to the top within the party, interacting with Hampton at various points in history.King doesn't commit the sin of falling head over heels with his subject. Like the Messiah in the holy book, Hampton had his demons that he had to constantly wrestle with. King takes a similar approach that Steven Spielberg took with ""Lincoln"", where we get a compelling real-life hero and learn about what they had to overcome both externally and internally. This treatment also extends to O'Neal, whom King doesn't wholly vilify or pardon. We're shown the path O'Neal initially led himself down and how he saw an opportunity to work for the FBI. While it's an easy decision to make, King lets the audience decide how to perceive O'Neal's actions.With Steve McQueen's go-to cinematographer Sean Bobbitt in his crew, King makes this one of the most surprisingly gorgeous movies of the year. Incorporating a mixture of long takes and over-saturation, King and Bobbitt perfectly illustrate the vibrant urban setting. And the jazz-infused score carries the sharp tension with its low trombones.At just over two hours long, King carries his film with great energy from beginning to end. Expertly filmed action is interspersed throughout as well as sharply edited speeches that contain more action than the actual shootouts. Even when King falters for a few brief moments at the beginning of the third act, he picks himself back up and delivers an utterly spine-chilling and infuriating ending that properly uses the clichÃ©d element of postscript.""Judas and the Black Messiah"" is an all-powerful work from director Shaka King and the two leads of Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield. Both timely and historical, this biopic will surely land near the top of my best-of-year list and is not one to miss.","8","hunter-friesen"," ""Judas"" invigorates Fred Hampton's legacy

"858","Maybe I had too many expectations about this one, and I felt let down by the linear and unsurprising story-telling.I honestly don't think it deserves the high praise I read in the comments.
On the exact same subject, the recent Trial of the Chicago 7 set the bar so much higher in terms of plot and story unfolding.Despite some great acting performances, I find Judas and the black Messiah kind of flat and empty. Not to sound like a broken record, but watch the Chicago 7 instead.","5","rklemm05"," Not joining the cult
"
"859","There's definitely a bunch of interesting stories to tell about the Black Panthers and their battle for civil rights, but while it's hard to put my finger on the exact reason why, I felt that Judas and the Black Messiah wasn't quite as good at telling its story as I was hoping it might be. I think one of the biggest problems I had with this script is the fact that it is bisected down the middle, and doesn't stick with a singular narrative. On the one hand, it is about Fred Hampton and his rise to leadership in the Black Panther party. This is a powerful story and one that I think could keep an audience riveted for the full run-time of a film. I thought Daniel Kaluuya did a superb job of portraying this man who could appear larger than life, while still keeping him grounded so we could relate to him. I found some of the intimate moments he has in the film to be the most compelling aspect of the entire plot because it contrasted nicely with his big personality when in front of a crowd. Fred Hampton's story is what worked best for me, and I would have enjoyed exploring his journey the entire time, along with the general rise and fall of the Black Panthers movement.Yet there is another story being told here, and it wouldn't be hard to argue that this is intended to be the main plot of the entire film. This is where we learn about Bill O'Neal and how he rose up the ladder of the Black Panthers while still being an informant for the FBI. I know that it can be interesting to take a look at this journey, but it didn't connect with me as deeply. For starters, drawing the analogy to ""Judas"" feels flawed, because this was not a man who belonged to the Black Panther party before being recruited by the FBI. He's basically an undercover agent, and that makes it hard to feel tension or stress for him the entire time. The movie makes it crystal clear that he is in the wrong for what he is doing, so why should I care if he is unmasked. LaKeith Stanfield even plays him a bit weaselly and conniving, which just makes him even less likable. I will say that I appreciated the way this film utilized Jesse Plemons' character, because it is rare for a movie like this to show a white person with some conflicted feelings (typically they are all shown as pure evil and 100% racist.) There is a decent movie in Judas and the Black Messiah, I just wish there wasn't also a lackluster movie in there.","6","blott2319-1"," 2 movies in 1, should have just been 1

"862","Ive been waiting for this film for a while and man, I have to say I was not disappointed at all. The performances are phenomenal, especially from Daniel Kaluuya. I challenge you to look up a clip of Fred Hampton, watch the film, and then spot out a moment where Kaluuya's demeanor, mannerisms and voice weren't akin to Hamptons. Lakeith Stanfield is also really great. While I understand Daniel Kaluuya's Fred Hampton is the central character of the film, Stansfield's performance and character William O'Neal, helps drive the movie. He convincingly plays a man who's drowned in the cynicism of being black during the 1960's. In addition to the performances, the entire film is crafted extremely well from the costume design and music to the cinematography. Especially as the film concludes, there are scenes directed and shot so well, they will stick with viewers long after watching.I really had to force myself to think of something negative here. One thing I wish however, is that certain female characters were written with a little more depth. For example, Dominique Fishback is stellar as Hamptons significant other, but I feel like she could have been utilized a bit more. Some may also have a problem with the story focusing on O'Neal just as much as Hampton. I also felt some of the prosthetics, particularly in the case of J Edgar Hoover were a little distracting as well.Overall, its rare in which almost every aspect of a film is remarkable, and this is exactly that. I see many Oscar nominations in its future with Stanfield getting a best supporting actor nod. As for Kaluuya, there is no doubt in my mind he will win Best Actor. Aside from what the film achieves technically, it offers an inside look into one of the most misconstrued political movements of our time. It's as informative as it is emotional. Regardless how hard aspects of it may be to watch, I encourage you to do so.","9","alistairpmcduffie47"," Daniel Kaluuya's 1st Oscar win coming up!

"864","Greetings again from the darkness. Electrifying. Towering. Ferocious. Choose whatever superlative you prefer to describe Daniel Kaluuya's performance as Fred Hampton, Chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party. Remarkably, Mr. Kaluuya captures Hampton's legendary oratory skills, and his stage presence reminds of Forest Whitaker's Oscar winning turn as Idi Amin in THE KING OF SCOTLAND (2006). And the most stunning part is that this isn't even really a story about Hampton. Director Shaka King, who co-wrote the script with Will Berson from a story by the Lucas brothers, Kenneth and Keith, actually devotes more time to Bill O'Neal, the FBI informant played by LaKeith Stanfield (SHORT TERM 12, 2013).The film opens with a montage of activists in the 1960s, including Bobby Seale, and transitions right into a 1968 FBI symposium where director J Edgar Hoover (Martin Sheen in botched make-up) tells the auditorium full of agents that the Black Panthers are the greatest security threat to America. From there we watch as Bill O'Neal, wearing a trench coat and fedora, steals a car from a group of men in a pool hall simply by waving an FBI badge. When he's apprehended, it's that badge, not the car, that puts young O'Neal (he was 19 at the time) in the precarious situation of going to prison or accepting (actual) FBI Agent Roy Mitchell's (Jesse Plemons, I'M THINKING OF ENDING THINGS, 2020) offer to infiltrate the Black Panthers as a federal informant.One of the film's most memorable lines occurs when Agent Mitchell asks O'Neal why he impersonated an agent. The reply: because ""a badge is scarier than a gun"". It's a belief that still holds true more than 50 years later. And that sentiment is a key part of Mr. King's film. Blatant racism within law enforcement is on display through both the Chicago Police Department's harassment, and the FBI (and Hoover's) strategy to prevent the rise of black people.As fascinating as Hampton and O'Neal are as characters (and real life men), the script falters in a couple of ways. We never really get to know Hampton except as the fire and brimstone speaker on stage. As impressive as that is, it's a mystery to us how this 21 year old man became so inspirational and skilled at forming alliances. His ""rainbow coalition"" goal to unite local groups to battle 'the establishment' is remarkable, but we are left to wonder if feeding the poor and opening a local medical center were possible through any method other than all-out war. And if so, why the stock pile of guns? Another letdown with the script is that we are not shown how O'Neal manages to become so quickly trusted, and promoted to head of security.Most of this is told through the eyes of O'Neal, and Stanfield is terrific at capturing the internal conflict and constant danger. Included here are dramatic recreations of O'Neal's interview on a 1989 PBS documentary entitled ""Eyes on the Prize 2"", and he admits to considering Agent Mitchell a role model. Unfortunately, the movie never shows this type of connection between the men. Rather, it's an awkward and forced bond between two men, neither of which are comfortable with the actions required of their situation. That's not to say the two don't share some tense moments, because they do. Especially effective is when Mitchell explains to O'Neal that the Black Panthers are the same, and equally destructive, as the Ku Klux Klan.Writer-director King and writers Berson, Lucas, and Lucas are all best known for their TV work, so this is a huge step forward for them. It's a powerful movie that explains some of the Black Panther ideology and how it was treated by law enforcement. The ""War versus Politics"" explanation cuts to the bone, as do the actual clips played over the opening and closing credits. Dominique Fishback deserves mention for her terrific supporting turn as Hampton's girlfriend, especially in her final scene. If you've ever wondered about the responsibility of leading a revolution, or the inner turmoil of being a snitch, then you'll find some answers in this memorable film from Shaka King.

"869","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Judas and the Black Messiah was a last-minute addition to this year's Sundance, which basically changed every list about the most anticipated films of the festival, including my own. The buzz surrounding its Oscar chances, the remarkable cast, and mainly its important narrative based on true events were more than enough reasons to generate an undeniably powerful hype. When I watch movies inspired by real people and/or true stories, I want them to teach me about the historical moment they're depicting. I want to finish my viewing sessions and know more than what I did at its beginning. I want the film to be enlightening, thought-provoking, and, most of all, impactful.I'm just a young white man living in Portugal with no previous knowledge of who Fred Hampton was or what he did. The closest I got to learning something about him was during last year's The Trial of the Chicago 7, but that movie wasn't even focused on the Black Panther Party, let alone one of his most important revolutionaries. My voice is far from being meaningful in regards to this film, and I will share Black critics' articles that I find to be worthy of investing your time in reading. However, I do have an opinion about this movie, and I'm in my right to share it. I find Shaka King's flick to have all of the qualities I mentioned above and much more. One of the best films of the festival, and I'm not risking it by writing it will end up as one of my favorite movies of the year.In all honesty, I found myself struggling to completely understand Fred Hampton's intent during the first half or so. His goals are clear and can be summed up in simply trying to offer everyone a better life, one that was fair and where everyone was treated equally. My issue wasn't in his motivations or beliefs, but on the violent, murderous path that Hampton was *apparently* inciting people to take - I repeat, I didn't know a single thing about the real story nor Hampton himself. However, Daniel Kaluuya's very first words as the character stuck with me until now - ""We're not gonna fight fire with fire, we're gonna fight it with water. We're not gonna fight racism with racism. We're gonna fight it with solidarity. We're not gonna fight capitalism with Black capitalism. We're gonna fight it with socialism"" - and he kept developing this idea, which I find incredibly timely.The scene that ultimately cleared my perception of Hampton's ideas was when William O'Neal takes the latter's most famous speech at the end of the second act in its most literal sense, which leaves Hampton baffled and shocked at O'Neal's interpretation of his words. Hampton's reaction, as well as a more emotional moment with the mother of his child, Deborah Johnson (Dominique Fishback), was the click I needed to fully comprehend the revolutionary's desires. This is one of the best compliments I can offer Shaka King and Will Berson's exquisite, detailed screenplay. It doesn't make Hampton a flawless superhero that never makes mistakes but instead depicts him as a human being who fought for everyone's rights. The latter is closer to being a Messiah than the former.The intricate narrative might feel a bit too heavy for some viewers, but it packs extraordinarily energetic, inspirational, chill-inducing speeches that I won't forget that soon. Both Hampton and O'Neal raise sensitive themes that will definitely leave the audience thinking and discussing them throughout the year. Despite it being the longest film of the festival, its two-hour runtime feels adequate and well-paced. In addition to this, the terrific, ""in your face"" cinematography (Sean Bobbitt) focuses on the actors' performances, not giving a chance to the viewers to be distracted with anything else besides the characters' words. The emotional investment in the characters elevates the well-edited (Kristan Sprague) shooting sequences that left me on the edge of my seat (couch), which ultimately serves as a huge praise to the movie's writing.I left the cast for last. Now, I know 2021 just started, but if Daniel Kaluuya isn't nominated in every single awards show for the respective Best Supporting Actor category, I'll riot. I've yet to witness a less-than-great display from this unbelievably talented actor. Kaluuya is exceptionally captivating from the very first time he shows up on-screen and never drops his level. Lakeith Stanfield is also brilliant as a conflicted William O'Neal, delivering an extremely complex portrayal of someone who has to deal with actions he knows are wrong. Dominique Fishback and Jesse Plemons (Roy Mitchell, an FBI agent) also deserve a shoutout.Judas and the Black Messiah deserves all the hype it's been getting and some more. Shaka King and Will Berson deliver a film inspired by true events with all the qualities this type of movie needs: enlightening, inspirational, thought-provoking, and tremendously impactful. Boasting what I'm sure will end up as one of the year's best performances (Daniel Kaluuya), the story of Fred Hampton and William O'Neal is told through an incredibly captivating narrative, filled to the brim with absolutely epic, riveting, chill-inducing speeches and dialogues that will leave no viewer indifferent. Both characters bring timely themes back to the spotlight, hopefully generating a critical discourse regarding freedom, human rights, and equality. Besides Kaluuya, Lakeith Stanfield deserves massive praise, and I can't forget about the lingering, character-driven cinematography that elevates every single scene. Final shoutout to Mark Isham and Craig Harris's unforgettable, addictive score that plays a significant role in the narrative.Rating: A","9","msbreviews"," Sundance 2021: Judas and the Black Messiah is enlightening, inspirational, thought-provoking, and tremendously impactful.

"871","Judas and the Black Messiah is,in my opinion,The Best Film of The Year.
Shaka King's movie has achieved every task in order to become an Academy Award Film,King talks in Judas and the Black Messiah about:racism,the human nature,the human rights as well as showing us that being diferent,in America,is a crime.
I have to say that the cast is beyond amazing,especially the duo between Daniel Kaluuya(Fred Hampton/The Black Messiah) and Keith Stanfield(Wiliam O'Neal/Judas).
By the way,the soundtrack is something that I'd never heard in a long time.Every sound/song is electrifying and great.
As for the plot/story arc of the film,the 1st and the last act are beautiful but the 2nd act is a bit confusing but nonetheless is still great.
Watching Judas and The Black Messiah,for a second,it made me feel like I was watching either a Spike Lee film or a Martin Scorsese movie.That's how great Shaka King's motion picture is,even better than some of the films produced by Lee or Scorsese.
I just hope that either Kaluuya or Stanfield,if not both,will win an Academy Award for their magnificient performances.
Overall,Judas and The Black Messiah is definitely the best film of the year and try and see it as soon as you can because you won't know what you miss.","10","lacatusalexandru"," One of the most powerfull films.

"872","What most of us know going into Judas and the Black Messiah is that the 1969 Illinois chairman of The Black Panther party, Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya), is destined to be assassinated like his counterpart Malcolm X and in the spirit of Martin Luther King. What we don't know is that Fred was only 21, shy, a father-to-be, and a warm-hearted devotee of human rights.Director Shaka King's docudrama is strongest when Fred interacts with his fellow revolutionaries like Bill O'Neal (LaKeith Stanfield), albeit Bill will turn out to be an informant for the FBI and contribute to Fred's death. As Fred encourages his colleagues to violent overthrow, he is light as air in his embrace of those closest to him, especially his love and future mother of his boy, Dominique (Deborah Johnson).Writers King and Will Berson carefully show the ambivalences that permeate the parlous circumstances, such as Fred's awareness of his life in danger versus the blinding need to put himself in harm's way to further the cause for liberation of Black people. And the torn allegiance of Bill to his role as informant versus his growing affection for the movement. And agent Roy Mitchell's (Jesse Plemons) lack of affect when he guides Roy to Fred's death but our suspicion that he is becoming sympathetic to the cause.The camera is our guide--it takes us up close to the participants, making us as claustrophobic as they while the doom slowly approaches. In other words, drama is present even in the cold reality of bloody history.Kaluuya and Stanfield should be nominated for Oscars as should the film. Yet the real winner will be the audience, which will have a front row seat to history and a heavy heart for those brave young idealists who gave the full measure to their dreams.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","jdesando"," One of the best of the year, and an outstanding docudrama.

"873","Judas and the Black Messiah is a richly told story of the leadership, revolutionary activism, and eventual assassination of Black Panther Fred Hampton, and powerful addition to the social revolution films of the 1960s and early 1970s.
Seeing history brought to life in a viscerally real and emphatic manner, made the work very compelling to me.Fred Hampton was killed at the age of 21 on December 4th, 1969. The aggrieved parties would wait well over a decade for justice with a civil suit settlement of $1.85 million in 1982 after an initial coroner's jury inquest in January of 1970 found Fred Hampton's death justifiable homicide.The writing pulls heavily from historical texts with Black Panther phrases such as ""War is politics with blood. Politics is war without blood."" King also manages to pose questions about how to make progress as his characters address the concepts of reform and revolution. While the film is set in 1968-69, these issues are still prevalent today. On HBO Max. Do yourself a favor and check it out. You'll be glad you did.","10","lkgleeson"," Judas and the Black Messiah

"875","As someone who did not know the real events or people this movie was based on, it was an eye-opening experience into what life was like back then. The camera work is rock solid, with genuine tense moments and powerful performances from the main characters.Watching the events unfold back then brings an interesting juxtaposition to recent events in America. Police brutality rooted in racism is still a reality. People in power with discriminatory beliefs still exists. It made me think about several realities that are still going on today. It made me think about how people in power can easily abuse their position. We like to think regulation is important to keep these people in check, but who's regulating the regulators? People in power can easily hire regulators to maintain the status quo.And what about crime rates? It disproportionately involves people of color because of centuries of racism that become rooted in the very culture of children born in lower socioeconomic groups. Violence begets violence, and crime begets more crime. We're definitely living in a better time now than what it was like 50 years ago. But we can do better. And nothing is more powerful than educating the next generation about the truth, about critical thinking, and about actively doing what they believe is right.I have barely talked about this film, but I appreciate that a film like this exists. It allows the viewer into a glimpse of the past, informing the audience about an issue that perhaps they may not understand. It puts us directly into the shoes of a group of people doing what they think is right for their future generation. It is creative works like these that may challenge your world view, and it may help you understand about the struggles and plight of people that are different than you. To that, I applaud the film.For those who have no idea about the real events like I was, this is a great film to increase your awareness on a subject you might not know much about.","8","cornerofspace"," Eye-opening.

"876","An excellent film, brilliantly interpreted and directed by Shaka King telling the true story of a young leader of the black panthers murdered by the FBI. The film is told from the perspective of an FBI infiltrator within the movement.
This true story is a violent slap in the face, as things have not changed since then and reminds us of the extent to which injustice, political bashings and an oppressive police force are still on the rise. Numerous archive images slipped throughout the film illustrate this drama and its issues which unfortunately have not aged 50 years. Any attempt to emancipate the people from the system is systematically drowned out by a minority of powerful wishing to preserve their way of life by using endless methods of division, stigmatization, and mounted blows, including assassinations.

"878","This movie can be complementary to ""The Trial of the Chicago Seven"", and it deepen the story of the Black Panthers party, and how were subject to injustices by the FBI and the Police Department, in an historical time where racism was extremely bad and costed a lot of innocent lives. Such a tragedy, that here is portrayed in a realistic and bloody way. Definitely not an easy watch.Daniel Kaluuya's performance was simply amazing, he has such an intense energy during stage scenes, and he simply nailed Freddy Hampton characterization. For sure one of the best portrayal of the first part of 2021, he completely captured me. Also LaKeith Stanfield did a good job. Bill O'Neill, a man that in order to run away from crime charges, was infiltrated by the FBI into the Black Panthers headquarters, in order to provide information to authorities and avoid prison. However he will pay a really high toll, and the real guy, not able to handle anymore this weight, decided to end his own life. He was really on a though spot, but the FBI definitely used him to do the dirty job. Unfair agency strategies are very often reported in the film and, even if these are well known facts, it is still disgusting what the USA were able to do, in order to meet their own agenda.""Judas and the Black Messiah"" is very balanced, it never tried to paint Hampton as a hero, director managed to be impartial, by highlighting both negative and positive aspect of the movement: the main objective was definitely noble, but means used were not always orthodox. No politically correctness involved here, and I am happy that WB just let the director tell the story in his own way by presenting real facts.

This movie is based on the true story of Fred Hampton, the Chairman of the Chicago, Illinois Black Panther Party during the 1960's & 70's. Daniel plays Fred. LaKeith plays William O'neal, the man recruited by the F.B.I. to infiltrate the Black Panthers and inform on Daniel and his associates. Martin plays the head of the F.B.I., J. Edgar Hoover-in almost unrecognizable make_up-and Jesse plays the F.B.I. agent that is blackmailing LaKeith to be a rat. Punches are not pulled, as far as storytelling goes. As our former president once said, 'There is good and bad on both sides.' Daniel is shown as uniting people of different races at his meetings-he gets people of all colors, including white and brown to attend-and he also has militant people working for him that want nothing more than to bring bloodshed to 'The Man'. Some of the normally thought of as good guys are shown doing.....well, let's just say, less than good guy deeds. The end credits inform you of what happened to certain people after the events of the movie are over.
It's rated ""R"" for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 6 minutes.

"895","In a day and age where acknowledgement of marginalized American citizens has become more prevalent than ever, films like Judas and the Black Messiah feel like necessary additions to the struggles of the black panther movement in the late 60s and early 70s. With beloved actors Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield and a healthy distribution from HBO Max backing the project up, this film is surely to be a contender for the eventual 2021 oscars. So what makes this film worthy of not only critical appraisal, but also Kaluuya's Screen Actor Guild award?As the film depicts the rise and fall of revolutionary activist Fred Hampton (Kaluuya), what makes the film striking is how it presents all these details in a powerfully bold manner. Not unlike the movements from Malcolm X or Bobby Seale, the way Hampton struck fear and determination through his brash speeches allowed the movements for racial justice to grow bigger and bigger over the years. Considering just how many enemies Hampton had on his shoulders as much as allies, it made the movement he helped lead that much more of a target to the racist FBI. And yet, this movie itself is just as focused on FBI informant William O'Neal (Stanfield) coaxing with Hampton in an attempt to reimburse his status to lead in on the movement, even if it does cost him the solid relationship he builds with Hampton. While one could argue O'Neal's special agent handler Roy Mitchell doesn't quite have the same developed amount of substantive screen time as he could have to make O'Neal's time with him memorable, at the end of the day, the relationship between O'Neal and Hampton wins by default in terms of plot points.One could even argue the movie is at its peak in sequences rather than the whole. While the scenes of Hampton's partner Deborah Johnson are gorgeously romantic and all the more heartbreaking as the film goes on, the scenes with Martin Sheen portraying J. Edgar Hoover are so hamfistedly jingoistic that it comes off more as a parody than a serious stake. Fortunately, Sean Bobbitt's phenomenal cinematography and Kristan Sprague's tight editing allows the pacing of these scenes to smooth well enough, even if some are written and performed better than others. Also, director Shaka King does not hold back on displaying just how violent this film can get in depicting what the panthers and FBI get themselves into, as it allows more of a gut punch to the viewers than first expected. It seems that today, the views people have towards the federal police have grown steadily worse overtime, especially from the views of African Americans. So with films like this, showcasing the paranoid induced violence sticks out like a necessary evil that should not be forgotten anytime again.If you own HBO Max and you're in the mood for a solid biopic on racial injustice and ambivalence being its own downfall, Judas and the Black Messiah is a healthy contender. It's debatable if the movie will stand the test of time as one of the great biopics on black historical events, but nevertheless, it will hopefully make a cultural impact in this still ongoing pandemic. With many audiences desperately in need of being reeducated on black history, this film will mark a triumphant return to the month's prevalence in reminding us why we shouldn't take these objective tales for granted.","7","elicopperman"," Necessary Look into the Black Panther Movement

"897","Judas and The Black Messiah (2021)Two things that come to mind when hearing the name Judas: Jesus Christ and betrayal. Judas loved Jesus, he believed in his ideas, he was his close friend and yet he betrayed him for 30 silver coins. After being arrested by the FBI, Bill O'Neal finds himself joining the Black Panthers as a spy. Initially, he doesn't care about their struggle as he is in it purely to avoid incarceration. However, once Fred Hampton's revolutionary ideas manage to crawl into his mind, Bill finds himself at a moral crossroad.On one side, he likes staying out of jail while getting paid by the FBI; on the other, he feels the rebellious spirit coursing through his veins as he gets closer and closer to The Black Messiah and LaKeith plays that part to perfection. Daniel Kaluuya gives a volcanic performance as Fred Hampton and yet it felt like a miscasting despite his tremendous energy. The real 21 year old Fred looked like a man of knowledge with wisdom beaming out of his eyes; the same couldn't be felt about Daniel who is also 10 years older. Furthermore, instead of delving deeper into Fred's life, the movie limits his time while choosing to focus on shootouts.What is important in any revolutionary film, specially if it aims to be realistic, is to portray both sides of the coin and I think this movie doesn't achieve that objective. Instead of focusing on counter politics, Bill's motivations or Fred's backstory, the film runs all over the place as events and characters are introduced without any development simply for the sake of adding layers and creating noise.Despite losing it's focus, the movie successfully establishes a core idea which will hopefully inspire peole to read about these events. Aesthetically, the film felt immersive as the revolutionary spirit was flowing through the screen; Kendrick Lamar's Hiii Power would have fit nicely here. Giving credit where credit is due, the movoe stayed true to the title by managing to make it all about Judas and his weakness. On the day when he was tasked with the ultimate betrayal, Bill burst into tears just as Judas cried when he had to betray Jesus and in a way, that felt poetic.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for Movies and Tv shows","7","arabnikita"," Lives up to its Biblical Title

"898","A knowledge of American history over the last fifty years and, in particular, a knowledge of what went down in the Black Panther Movement would help but is far from essential in getting a great deal out of Shaka King's superb new film ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" which tells the story of how Black Panther leader Fred Hampton was betrayed by F.B.I. informant Bill O'Neal leading to his assassination by J. Edgar Hoover's thugs supposedly acting in the name of the law. It's a shocking story and since I wasn't aware of these events before I suppose I approached the film like a piece of good fiction, (it's certainly not trying to be a documentary), and it grips like any really good thriller should.A terrific Daniel Kaluuya, (in Oscar-worthy form), is Hampton and the consistently brilliant LaKeith Stanfield is just as good as his Judas while Jessie Plemons has his best big-screen role to date as the F.B.I. agent who recruits O'Neal. Dominque Fishback is also very good as the activist who falls for Hampton and has his son. This is an actor's piece in the best sense of the term and it's beautifully shot by Sean Bobbitt. Of course, it's also a deeply political film and the audience for political films is limited and without that prior knowledge I spoke of, you might find some of it confusing but as a thriller about betrayal and as an expose of how ruthless governments can be, (nothing new there, of course), it works superbly and ultimately that's all that matters. How much of it actually happened in the way King tells it I have no idea but it certainly feels right and it deserves to be widely seen.","8","MOscarbradley"," A shocking slice of recent American history.

"899","""Words are beautiful, but action is supreme.""Judas and the Black Messiah has taken storm since its release. It tells the story of Fred Hampton, Chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party, and his fateful betrayal by FBI informant William O'Neal. At its release during the Sundance Film Festival this year, I was lucky enough to see this. After seeing almost 30 movies, I felt the fatigue at that point and didn't feel as strongly about the film. I did give it a higher score than I felt initially because I knew that I would like it more had not felt the way I did. Let me tell you, watching this a second time was phenomenal. Shaka King made an incredible piece of work. It exceeds as a thriller. The whole time I felt like I was on the edge of my seat. The scenes are so intense and it's King's great direction. I love how the technical aspects are presented. Firstly, the score is both unnerving and fitting for the time period. The cinematography looks stunning and is shot in a way to make you feel like you're apart of the story. And the editing only helps with the thrill of it. King also wrote the screenplay along with Will Berson. The dialogue is really good. Sometimes with biopics, writers are more focused on the factual aspect that they forget to use dialogue to further develop these characters in a meaningful way. All the characters, or rather real people, had a connection with the audience. And I really like how they don't necessarily take one side to the story. Yes, we're supposed to side more with the Black Panthers, and we do the whole time, but it also shows how it could get extreme sometimes with Fred Hampton's views.Speaking of Fred Hampton, Daniel Kaluuya is phenomenal. There's no possibly way he won't win the Oscar. This is one of the performances that sticks with you long after watching. He captured Hampton's essence perfectly. Another great performance comes from Dominique Fishback as Deborah Johnson. Her performance is going to make her a well-known actress in the future. LaKeith Stanfield also gives a wonderful performance as always. You can see the conflict in his eyes the whole time. This is just one of the best ensembles recently. There really isn't much to hate here. I had a pacing issue at one point, but the film is stellar. I can't imagine anyone really hating this, unless they have a vendetta against the Black Panthers or something. Even CinemaScore gave it an A. As the Oscars approach soon, I'd hope that this gets the attention it deserves. Though it hasn't been showing up at many awards (other than Kaluuya), it's accessible to all with its release in theaters and HBOMax. Also the reviews have all been positive except just a few. I think Judas and the Black Messiah is one of the best thrillers out there and will be remembered as one of the best of the 2020s.","9","sweidman-28016"," Phenomenal Thriller

I felt that the dialogue was so unauthentic, i don't believe this would be a real fight.. one talks and the other listens then reply back.. this doesn't happen. They used big words that no one ever use in a fight. There whole part about the filmmaker complaining from the critics is so forced.. i felt it was so irrelevant to the whole story.
The whole of black and white, is kind of forced so people would feel that it is a deep artistic movie, while in fact i felt it was so shallow.
For example, marriage story was a movie about couples arguing and was so authentic than this one, we would be lessening marriage story if we compare it to this one.
Zendaya's acting was disturbing.. i felt she was also forcing the drama, and forcing the reactions, there was something so weird about the way she talks and reacts.At the end i guess that if this movie is divided into separate stories, in a separate short film, it would be much better.","4","salmamahfouz"," Fake deepness

"905","This movie starts out really solid, the first 20 minutes feel like a really good short film. The movie should've just ended there. Basically after that the conversation and conflict between characters just go in circles for another hour and a half. It's basically pointless. Movie is also very pretentious, with this black-and-white filter making it look all artsy but it's really just trying to act cool. The acting is pretty good, but nothing can save this movie from it's terrible pacing. It is very dull and feels like we are hearing words directly out of the directors mouth. It's more like an autobiography or a blog post than a movie.","4","dashtag1234"," Should Have Been A Short Film
"
"906","Probably would have been better as a short film, because it really started to drag and feel a little repetitive in the second half.It's a decent effort to do one of those one-location, limited cast kind of movies, but it is let down in the writing, with some dialogue that feels very overwritten at points, and a lot of scenes that feel like they hammer home the same point again and again. You could argue it's intentional, but I'm sure there would be ways to have that repetition as a theme without making the film feel like a bit of a chore to sit through after about the 50-minute mark.That being said: even though the black and white cinematography doesn't seem to serve a concrete purpose, it does look fairly nice. And the film is saved by its two performances, who do surprisingly good work with a screenplay packed with lines (and whole scenes) that would be difficult to act convincingly.Overall, it's far from terrible, and I did get a fair bit of enjoyment out of the first half and small parts here and there in the second, but it doesn't quite sustain itself well enough to justify the feature-length runtime, in my opinion.","5","Jeremy_Urquhart"," Has its moments for sure, but can't quite sustain itself through all 106 minutes

"907","This movie was exactly what i was expecting when i saw the poster.It is insanely pretentious that it is sometimes cringeworthy.I think this is an interesting concept, a film consisting of just two people and showing their relationship over the course of a single night. After watching i think it might work better as a short film as by the end of its run time it seemed like it just had nothing else to say and felt like the same arguments over and over again.The male character is a film maker that thinks he is the best film maker since slice bread and the whole time i just couldn't stop thinking that he was just a mouth piece for the director. His words felt like the directors. It was like film school pretentiousness with him constantly talking about certain directors and certain moves and not understanding them like Citizen Kane.The whole shooting on film and in black and white was just done to be artsy in my eyes. Maybe it added something a little different to it but i thought it made this gorgeous house look terrible because the film was so noisy resulting in it being so grainy.The construction of some shots were really nice.The acting was ok. Zendaya was pretty good but the male lead was a little over the top for me. The script was another issue. It was so over written. It didn't feel like people talking, it felt like words of a page.The plot was sort of infuriating. It repeated its self so much.The worst part of the movie though was the plot regarding the critic. It was wrote from such a bitter place. The director obviously had a bad review from the LA Times probably the review for Assassination Nation. It was so awkward to watch. It is brought up so much and so often. Really really bad.I would say you could definitely skip it.","4","Golden_Hope"," Insanely Pretentious

"909","Let me just sate the obvious firstBRILLIANT ACTINGI love Zendaya she's absolutely outstanding in this film and in general, but if you watch this film for Zendaya only and literally nothing else, you have absolutely no substance and no appreciation for ones art and are clearly ignoring an equally brilliant performance by John David Washington.Anyone who has a problem with seeing the story of another couple or human emotion either has an unusually stable relationship or has never been in a relationship at all.I'm seeing so many mixed reviews and the more negative reviews tend to say the same thing with absolutely NO originality. ""it's pretentious"" ""not engaging"" ""it's just about a couple fighting"". You don't have to like the film but at the very least be original in your criticism.It's clear to me people are losing their sense of realism with being glued to the enormous trend of superhero sci-fi films and unnecessary sequels. Cinema is also about intriguing dialogue with realistic earthly circumstances. Sometimes you need to appreciate a more realistic emotional story.This film is simple yet at the same time complex as what most relationships are. Human emotion and romance isn't sappy or cheesy one liners you see in sitcoms. It's deep, its raw, its cruel, and it crosses boundaries.I give it a 7/10 overall it's a good film with excellent acting however the only critique I have with the film is that it remains the same with no unexpected twists or turns revealed.","7","tbunker-88294"," Cinema is not just about superheroes and explosions....and I'm a huge comic nerd

"911","This film has a good script with consistent argument-building. It's easy to follow and good enough to keep you interested throughout. For the rest, acting is ok and the youth, looks and fame of the protagonists helps the viewer get more invested in the film. Cinematography is looking alright and the black n white was a good choice; character blocking looks also vibrant and there's plenty of energy in many scenes. Indeed, some might find that small parts are pretentious or unnecessary and other parts rather hilarious such as the one JDW eating with his mouth open while shouting...but these do not spoil the entire film. Overall, the director/writer did a good job creating this piece, giving moments of debate about love, politics, existence and all delivered with a great pace. Maybe this is the new Valentines Day fav movie..? 8/10 strong effort by Levinson.","8","ThomDerd"," The script is buzzing-The actors are trying...

"915","Lots of reviews mention how repetitive the film is without appreciating that real-life arguments like this tend to be repetitive. Arguments with a loved one are often tense and rambly and passive aggressive and have their lulls and climaxes-- just as we saw with Malcolm and Marie. If you couldn't get through this film, maybe it's because there's someone in your life who you need to make some peace with...? Maybe?I appreciated the messiness and moral ambiguity of both characters, but I fully hated Malcolm's long-winded rants about filmmaking-- and I'm a Black media nerd. Malcolm's character felt too much like a vessel for directors' gripes about The Industry, and for the life of me I couldn't understand why Marie chuckled at him like his belligerence was charming. (But maybe *deep sigh* it's because she really loved him) The erratic emotions were raw and real and I honestly think it pays off in the end.Things I hated: the fact that they didn't just go tf to sleep when they got home

"917","This review is a mere speculation of what i observed of the movie.
firstly may i say i am so impressed with the dialogue in it, and the fact that with only Zendaya & John alone as cast, managed to pull a masterpiece.
one would say that that's very considerate given the fact that we're in a pandemic, i say: that's all he needed anyway.here's my speculation on the movie:Malcom (Sam as a producer) Marie (Sam's past as an addict)
it seems to me like Sam is arguing with himself in the movie; Marie was angry at the fact that he didn't thank her for the influence she had on his film, while he thanked everyone else.
Malcom apologizes and argues back that it wasn't ONLY about her, and starts to mention other people and situations.
to me the movie was very rich and real, touches subjects that usually linger only in the mind, and so little spoken.
it felt like a journey through Sam's mind and life struggles,
i could be wrong, nevertheless it's an incredible movie.","9","lenawal"," Sam ripping himself open

"922","I've to say i agree with other reviewers' stances that once you've seen the first 30 minutes, you've seen it all. it was exhausting to watch an hour and 40 minute long argument, especially one that went around in circles and repeated itself several times. a contributing factor to this is the characters who, despite being played by good, likeable actors, are both completely insufferable. zendaya gives a pretty good performance, but i can't say the same about jdw. he wasn't awful but it almost felt like he was acting for stage instead of screen. and the mac and cheese scene??? terrible. although i think the director is more to blame for that one, speaking of whom... i have to say i think on the part of levinson this film is incredibly self indulgent. you can tell he thought he was making an insightful and emotional drama, but as i wrote before, there is nothing new to be found in this film after the first half hour. unless you love watching people argue for way longer than you need to, you can skip this one.","4","robynjanecahill"," unjustified

"929","They fight - they try to have sex - they fight - they try to have sex - they fight - they try to have sex. Thats the whole movie in a nutshell. And you as the audience wonder if they end up having sex or not. That's the plot.
Ok that was really a very shallow view on this film as there is indeed more it tells but its nothing really new. We had that intimate look at a couple's relationship a lot of times before and there is not much to add. Sometimes the film feels like an extended version of the fight scene between Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in ""Eyes Wide Shut"". We learn a lot about the two characters lives, their past and they emotions. There are a few heartbreaking moments that really make it worthwhile. The acting is great, too which is the biggest bonus the film has. Without John David Washington and Zendaya there wouldn't be much left except for an excellent cinematography. But the screenplay is not really that thrilling. It just plays around with various topics of fights, a couple that questions their relationship, their motives. And all of that. Again, had that a dozens time before. The acting and style is what makes it special. The direction by Sam Levinson is also not too shabby. John David Washington is great and shows another range of his immense talent. This is also the film that hopefully gives Zendaya the respect as an actress she deserves. Both are fantastic, both have showed scenes. Both play off each other, its hard to say who is better, but in the essence we see a great showcase of two actors who will have a long and exciting career in Hollywood, who are about to become the leading actors of a new generation.

"931","IN A NUTSHELL:
Brilliantly written and directed by Sam Levinson, this is one of the very first movies to be written, directed, and produced during the Covid-19 pandemic! The entire movie was filmed in black and white, a visual symbol that speaks volumes, making this movie a piece of modern art. The film is already earning Oscar buzz for the film and the actors...all well deserved.John David Washington plays a filmmaker on the night of his premiere. As a film critic myself, his character's perspective and comments gave me a lot to think about. He and Zendaya's character talk about film, love, relationships, gratitude, politics, and art.THINGS I LIKED:
The fact that this movie only has 2 cast members is extremely impressive, especially considering how compelling they are to watch for almost 2 whole hours.
I'm such a huge fan of John David Washington and thought he was stellar in Blackkklansman. He's also EXCELLENT in this film. Did you know he's the son of Academy Award winner Denzel Washington? Not surprising. There's a scene at about the 40-minute mark that was truly amazing. It immediately reminded me of some of the unbelievable monologues his father gave in the movie Fences. It also reminded me of Adam Driver's jaw-dropping performance in Marriage Story. John David also joined the team of producers on this film.
Zendaya is only 24 years old and is already so incredibly accomplished in cinema. For being 12 years younger than John David, she sure did match his performance in this movie. I felt like she really grew up and gave an extremely impressive performance that puts her on the map. Because the movie was filmed during the pandemic, she did all of her own makeup, costume design, and set dressings. She also joined John David as a producer for the film. In fact, she was the one who contacted Sam Levinson to kickstart this project. They grew close during their time together filming Euphoria and continued to collaborate artistically. They all should be very proud of this work.
The direction and camera work were artistic masterpieces. Truly stunning.
I love that the movie was in black and white. Every frame is immaculate. There is mention of the classic black and white movie Citizen Kane. I think Orson Welles would have been proud of this film.
Fantastic one-shot scenes.
I thought the references to The Lego Movie movie were hilarious.
There are so many insightful comments about cinema. If you watch this movie, consider watching it with captions turned on and the pause button in your hand so you can really analyze and savor each flavorful line.
The Cee-Lo song that played during the end credits was perfect when he sings ""There's a fine line between love and hate."" The song is from the Outkast track Liberation
You will feel all the feels, especially if you've ever been in a romantic relationship.
Word has it that part of this movie's story was inspired by when Sam Levinson forgot to thank his wife during his speech at the Sundance Film Festival. Ouch.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Some viewers won't like watching a new film in black and white.
When the actors whisper to each other, it's hard to hear what they're saying.
I hate seeing Zendaya smoke, ruining the health of her cute body.
The constant fighting is exhausting. Sooooo much yelling.
I felt like I was being physically assaulted with all of that crude, violent language.
I wish Zendaya hadn't been in her underwear for most of the movie. Then again, I understand the visual portrayal of vulnerability.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
You see a woman sit on a toilet and later in a bathtub, but her private parts are covered. Later you see her in skimpy, revealing underwear.
Profanity, crude language, and sooooo many F-bombs
The ""N"" word is used several times.

"945","I want to start by saying that I LOVE Zendaya as an actress, I mean since a child she has had such a cute, genuine approach to every single role that she portrays. I mean how many actresses do you know that can go from a drugged out teen to a super hero one? She is AMAZING... But I don't think pitting her up against John Washington in this film was fair on any account. First of all, John's energy throughout the entire film, gave a sense of urgency and realism while Zendaya's character seemed very performative the entire time. And I understand that her character was meant to be ""weak"" to some extent, but during an argument, when someone is coming at you with that amount of fire in their words, no person in a serious relationship is going to be that willing to just cry and listen. I say this not because he is the son of Denzel, but because he carried the role, and the movie with such grace that kept you intrigued: He carried this movie all by himself. From listening to his music in the beginning, it was so real and honest, to the hurtful words he was saying while Marie was in the bathtub even to the subtleness of apologizing to Marie and finally thanking her like she asked, it was all open and real. Yes, relationships are messy and there is always going to be one person who is the ""dominant"" but Maries character was much to unrealistic in this movie. I feel like it would've been much better with an actress who could keep up with John's energy.","6","chrisdannie"," One Person Carried The Entire Movie... Can You Guess?

This is a simple film, with a simple premise but it's executed to perfection by Washington and Zendaya. The only problem with the movie ? It's being released in 2021 where audiences have the attention span of a gnat. There's no action or explosions or quotes to hashtag. It's just a story about a couple working through a handful of issues. Some of the dialogue is over the top but most of it is beautiful. Most of all, this movie has what most things do not in 2021: Authenticity. I appreciate people taking a chance and being unique, especially in our over commercialized culture.Kudos to the very small amount of people who made this movie happen so quickly.

It's certainly a glorious film to look at and the performances of Zendaya and Malcolm Washington are so captivating that I almost forgot that what I was watching was pretty much pointless.Watch it cautiously.

"964","I waited all night to watch this movie.
First of all I really like that it is black and white, because one can actually concentrate on the emotional dynamics. The whole movie is about those dynamics and in my eyes the way that the actors executed it all is brilliant. I think that all the people that see this piece only as a two-hour fight just fail to see the emotional journey that this film takes us through. I personally as a person that has been in a toxic relationship can really relate to many things I saw.
Another thing that i find so good about this film is that you don't know what's coming next. It is not predictable. I also laughed.. but because it was sad.
I admired Zendaya before this movie, now even more so. John is now also in my favorite list.

"970","First, so it doesn't get lost in the rest of this review, let me make it clear that this movie offers two painfully first-rate performances that will rip your emotional guts out. I've seen ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" several times, and I have to say that this movie is even more gut-wrenchingly powerful and well acted than that masterpiece.It also comes off as a lot more ""authentic"" - a word played with a lot n this movie. While I like WAOVW a lot, the dialogue is very often very theatrical. Here, while there is also dialogue that sounds as if it is being recited from a stage play - Malcom's remarkable speech, delivered half in the kitchen and half in the garden, that drops the names of MANY famous movie directors and script writers, all at remarkable speed, for example - that is less often the case.But this movie also plays with what we perceive to be natural. Perhaps the most remarkable instance of that is the scene where Marie presses the carving knife on the tile floor while truly terrifying Malcolm. You hang on every word of it, terrified of what she might do - only to discover that she is ""acting,"" making the point - very well - that sometimes you cannot tell when a person is using real emotions to act and when they are just expressing ""authentic"" emotion. Elsewhere in the movie Malcolm describes that as the difference between creating a work of art and just making a video of oneself emoting and then posting it on YouTube.That is brought home yet again at the end when we see that this movie was written and directed by a young white man, Sam Levinson, a point for which Levinson prepared us during Malcolm's garden-kitchen speech when the character asks what two Jewish men, David Selznick and Ben Hecht, could have had to contribute to Gone with the Wind. (A great deal, evidently.)Watching two people who have feelings for each other rip each other's hearts out is not fun - though Marie at one point says that audiences love to watch it. But when the script is good and the acting and directing first-rate, it is a powerful experience. I strongly recommend this movie, but only to those in a good enough mood that it will not drive them into depression.","9","richard-1787"," Few movies have held me like this one, but it is often a very painful experience

"971","So much deeper than what people are calling 'just a couple fighting for 100 or so minutes'. It's unique and refreshing and raw and I loved every minute of it. Granted, this movie won't be for everyone and I think it will be lost on a lot of people. But if you love movies and I mean truly love them then you'll love this film.The acting is incredible and award worthy. The writing passionate and bold and poetic. I think 'pretentious' is used too flippantly when you aren't as immersed into a world as someone else. But you don't need to relate to the showbiz part of these characters, that's surface level. The complexities deeper in their personalities are what this film is really about.This film is a character study of two flawed but brilliant people and portrayed so cleverly. You HAVE to look deeper than what they're saying.Beautifully shot. Zendaya is wonderful, John is wonderful. This film deserves more love.","8","chrissyhumphreys"," This film deserves more love

"980","On paper, this was set out to be a great success. Two great actors and an original style, but it didn't deliver. I thought the visual style was very nice with some interesting choice of shots and visuals. The acting from John David Washington was also quite good, I didn't think Zendaya was as good.However, the story has no depth. In a film, you are supposed to sympathize with characters and go through their journey and change, but here I found myself hating both characters. They simply didn't seem like good people so I didn't care for them. They argue over and over about the same thing, they swear too much to attempt to add intensity and the story doesn't really take different turns.

They don't give 8 minutes Monologs and psychological Analysis of their partner and yell for one hour and thirty minutes straight.

It is not a movie to be watched sitting back waiting for drama to escalate between the two characters until the great ending presents itself, glorious and full of emotion and absolution.I was really surprised to watch a movie like this on Netflix, and I do understand why the reviews are so low, since the people on the platform are not expecting this approach to cinema being shown in such a commoditized way.","8","123123BROCOLLI"," People consume movies like a junkie consumes narcotics

"984","This movie tries hard to be different and something that pulls you in. To me, it falls short on both.The main issue I have with this movie is the casting of Zendaya as the lead actress. Her acting is similar to Brie Larson's. They both are very ""dry"" and boring when delivering lines and both make scenes dull. Zendaya ruined the first Spider-Man film she was in for me with her acting. She is being overly sexualized in this film. She will be forever be looked at as a child to most due to her childish looks. This role should have been played by someone else.The dialog in this movie has powerful messages about Hollywood, but the overdone and uneccesary cursing deducts from it. They also say each other's names entirely too much.I wanted to like this movie, but it was not good at all.

Trying to deal with a conflict and reflecting a problem that has risen.Director Sam Levingson, Zendaya, and John David Washington coming together during the pandemic shutdown to create a short budget and small film might as well really keep this locked out.

The scene is so terribly plaid that it was even difficult continuing watching the film.
So thank you John D Washington for showing us you can be an excellent actor in silence (Tenet) and even in really long monologue (Malcolm & Marie).

"989","As we learned from 2019's divorce drama Marriage Story, a true conversation piece is traditionally between two people, there's generally a lot of shouting, debating, arguing and occasionally there's the odd flourish into serenity. It's often cathartic and quite thereputic for two actors with very good chemistry to vent at each other, Marriage Story was successful because of that - one reason why it's lead actors walked away with an Oscar nomination each. Malcolm & Marie is less the success story, more of a flawed conversation caper, though it's two leads aren't the film's main problem as both Zendaya fresh off her Primetime Emmy win for Euphoria and John David Washington who's starting to sound a lot like a young Denzel ever time we see him, their performances are solid, you'll be sold on it just for that alone they have fantastic chemistry almost as good as Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson in the aforementioned Marriage Story. Everything in Malcolm & Marie works, the script is good, the directing is gold and it receives an A+ in acting, but the thing that sinks it is it's less a conversation piece about a couple that's on the verge of braking apart more a thesis on how awful film critics can be, and even the film takes that into context when it leads into venting about white frustration. But other than that this quarantine written and directed film is provocative and seductively stylish that it's such a shame the film is brought down by wrought self indulgence. 3/5.","6","coreyjdenford"," Meh & Meh

"993","I absolutely love both Zendaya and John David Washington. They both gave phenomenal performances in the film, but the plot is where my real problems lie.Movies about relationships and moments in time are amongst some of my favorites. However, it has to have more. It has to have the heart that pulls us in and makes us really believe in what were watching. As if we are there, watching these characters lives unfold before us as we, the audience, try desperately to keep their fictional love alive. I live for movies I like that. I wanted to be invested. Malcolm and Marie missed the mark.There were some really beautiful scenes, but why was it filmed in monochrome? Black and white movies are fantastic, when it serves a purpose. It worked so well in Roma and The Lighthouse, BECAUSE IT SERVED A PURPOSE. Rather, in Malcolm and Marie it came off as a pretentious student film.The characters had the same arguments over and over again. Although I wasn't bored, it felt repetitive. I needed something more to grab onto. I needed a jaw dropping ending, I needed to think about when I made dinner and dream about when I went to bed. Alternatively, it left my mind the moment I switched off my TV. This isn't a movie im ever going to rewatch, and I doubt I'm alone in that respect.I'm giving it a 6/10, although the weak plot and ranting dialogue deserves less, Zendaya and John didn't disappoint. They both really know how to act.I don't know wether to recommend Malcolm and Marie or not.

I decided not the judge the movie too harshly just by the trailer so I gave it a shot. It's was extremely boring and slow moving. Just because it stars Zendaya doesn't automatically mean it's good. It was stretched out way too long. If it was on color,had more cast members,and was around 30-45minutes or so. I would of liked it much more. The story line is extremely basic and has no appeal what so ever. 3 stars for the ability to stretch out angsty argument throughout 2 people for an hour and 46 minutes and get it on Netflix.

"996","This is a film reliant on dialogue and if you can't watch a film with a run time of 100 minutes this isn't for you. But if you are someone you is invested by good writing, this film definitely has the right elements. This writing is good but could have been improved but that is purely for some of the dialogue. The acting itself is great, the chemistry feels real and very believable that these two actors actually are in a relationship which is very key for the film. For me Washington is that standout, he is amazing in this film and definitely shows glimpses of brilliance. Zendeya is good but not better than Washington, her character can either be extremely confident or emotional, and those emotions can switch a bit too quick which doesn't feel realistic or true to the material. The directing is good and the cinematography is visually pleasing, especially for a film in black and white.

"998","""Malcolm and Marie"" is not really my kind of movie, but I was very curious about it, as is the first production to be ever completed during the pandemic. So I wondered what the director could come up with, considering all limitations that this period bringed.The movie is set during one single night. For the entire length we see a couple going back and forth to the most painful and excruciating fight of their relationship. A lot of deep feelings are involved and the cast managed to portray extremely good the emotional weight of a story that is going to be tested really hard, and that maybe is on the brink. Cast nailed it and I liked both actors. Washington is on fire, he always kept such an intense energy for all scenes, he was dedicated to the role and you can clearly see this. Zendaya was a surprise for me, never heard of her, and even if she is not at the same level of her colleague, she still delivers a convincing acting.The first half of the movie is well conceived and kept me glued on the screen of my TV, but then on the second part it is just too repetitive. The couple fight always on same topics, two monologues portrayed by Malcolm are basically the same, nothing is added. Was it really necessary to make a movie almost two hours long? I think that this could have worked better just with a shorter runtime. The film could have been way more effective if it lasted just a little bit over one hour. It is more than enough to introduce, develop and end the story, At some point I was really wondering when it was going to end.Even though the entire film is set in a house, it feels very dynamic and intense. I suggest to watch it just out of curiosity, but do not expect a masterpiece. I personally liked the fact that was shot in black and white, I think that it just work better in this way, instead of using color.","5","fciocca"," Starts really good, but then it becomes repetitive.

However, she delivered but the movie is just outright pointless and exhausting. Two people yelling for around 100 minutes, playing music, smoking and cooking that's all you get. You wait for something to happen but it never does they fight, take a break then fight again.John David Washington is becoming bit of a disappointment, he was great in BlackKKlansman but since then his boring uncharismatic turn in Tenet and now here with Over the Top performance makes you wonder about his choices as an actor. A good actor should be good in anything regardless of the director but he just can't hold on to his own.Sam's Assassination of the Nation was over the top but fun timepass which lead to Euphoria but here he went 2 steps back instead of forward.

"1008","My wife and I happened to catch a program on PBS radio where this movie was being discussed, and the people (I believe they were critics) who were talking about it absolutely trashed it. But it got our curiosity up, so, with low expectations, we gave it a watch. I guess we just aren't as smart as the critics, because we both enjoyed it. None of the criticisms the critics made (i.e. overacting, stiff acting, poor dialog) was valid to us. I'm wondering if one particular scene that was rather critical of a movie critic simply ticked the real critics off, so they were trying to exact their revenge.Anyone who's been in a serious relationship could likely relate to the feelings the actors portrayed, and the amount of dialog they needed to perform was astounding. For us, even though the movie featured only 2 people in a conversation over the course of one long night, it held our attention.

"1014","As ""Malcolm & Marie"" (2021 release; 106 min.) opens, the couple arrives home late at night, after Malcolm's latest film has premiered to apparently great buzz. Malcolm is putting on some great music, while Marie starts preparing some mac and cheese. As the conversation turns, we learn that Marie is quite upset with Malcolm as he failed to thank her in his post-movie's speech, despite the film being inspired by her drug addiction in a prior life. It marks the start of a looooong evening...Couple of comments: this is the latest project from Sam Levinson, best known for the HBO TV series ""Euphoria"", starring Zendaya. When ""Euphoria"" shut down production due to COVID-19, he pitched some ideas for a feature film to Zendaya, who eagerly accepted this particular idea. John David Washington equally jumped on it. It all sounded so promising, and when I saw the film's trailer recently, I couldn't wait to see this. Alas, something doesn't quite add up. The biggest shortcoming is without a doubt the script. It's just not equipped to provide 1 hr. and 45 min. of in-depth characters. To be clear: there are only 2 characters in the film. The trajectory of the characters is too obvious: from hot to cold, to hot again, and then to cold again, and at some point you just want to yell ""enough already!"". Check out the long monolgue that Malcolm gives upon reading the LA Times review of his new film ""by that white chick"". I mean, even John David Washington collapses in the film at the end of that rant from sheer exhaustion! But then there are scenes that are very powerful. So in the end it's a bit of a bixed bag, and frankly this feels like a missed opportunity. Please note that the film is shot in B&W, and features an outstanding soundtrack with choice cuts from James Brown, Outcast, and many others. It is also noteworthy that this is touted as the first Hollywood film produced and shot entirely during the COVID-19 pandemic, adhering fully to the COVID restrictions during the movie's production.""Malcolm & Marie"" was self-financed by Sam Levison and his wife (with a minuscule $2.5 million production budget), and then Netflix snapped it up for an eye-popping $30 million. The film was released for a limited theatrical run this past weekend, before then moving on to Netflix in the near future. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at turned out to be a private screening: I was the only person in the theater (and the rest of the theater complex resembled a ghost town). I honestly don't know how movie theaters can operate profitably in the current pandemic. And it's not like this will change any time soon. Meanwhile if you are interested in a relationship drama or are simply a fan of Zendaya or John David Washington, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (if you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","6","paul-allaer"," The thin line between love and hate (but the sum of the parts doesn't add up)

"1015","A pretentious man and a mentally unstable woman fight for almost two hours. That's it.The cinematography is gorgeous. The directing has its moments. And actors are certainly talented. But my goodness, this movie felt like being hit with a hammer in the head repeatedly for its entire duration.After the first 20 minutes I thought to myself, ""That was a pretty good short film. I didn't mind that."" But then it kept going and going and going. And the longer it went the less relatable and more awful the two leads were revealed to be.The man is an egotistical and pretentious sort who keeps a list of all the favors he does for his girlfriend and holds it over her head when she asks for anything in return. The woman is mentally unstable and verbally abusive, gaslighting and playing the victim in a toxic manipulative way. The way they portray the supposed ""fine line between love and hate"" bears no actual semblance to real life or real relationships - at least not in mine. If your relationship is like this - RUN. This is not normal. This is not okay.Every argument that starts back up again only shows more why both characters don't deserve our sympathy. We do not know anything about either character except what they tell us by screaming at each other over the course of the film. It's exhausting. It's unwatchable at times.I gave this a slightly higher rating at first - a 5/10 - because from a technical standpoint, it's very well made I just didn't care for the handling of the plot. (That's not to say I didn't enjoy the idea, I think films like Locke are intriguing and Marriage Story was fantastic. This didn't quite do it for me though because... well, the toxicity of it all) But after seeing how women of Twitter have responded, my feelings toward the movie have soured a bit more. This honestly reminds me of when Fight Club came out and the narcissistic a-holes who watched that idolized Pitt's character and turned him into a hero. Now it's the turn for the abusive, toxic women to have their hero.","4","SimonsRants"," Stop. Just Stop

"1018","Straight out the gate, don't think of it as the black version of Marriage story, it doesn't have the maturity of characters nor the same depth of conflict together with the stakes that film beholds. Malcolm and Marie is not pretentiously profound like how other critics try to make it seem, it is a beautiful film featuring the outburst of emotions from two unstable lovers with contrasting personalities and we go with them as they go through a night of intimacy intertwined with toxicity. Well-shot and well-directed, it looked liked a ""high-end disagreement"", and amidst the pettiness between two lovers their environment blends well with their situation, the mood right from start glued me to my screen from start to finish.Both actors did an amazing job and huge part of it is because of the superb writing, but I see people criticizing the chemistry between Zendaya and John, and I honestly believe Zendaya is a very replaceable part of the film, but nonetheless she did great and delivered her best performance of her acting career, John is so versatile and honestly, he could be a leading man of an another romantic film. This is one of those films where we supervise and go where the characters' dialogue take us, don't go looking for a huge arc, just enjoy and feel the actors' performance cause for sure both gave heart-felt acting.","9","Bviruiyan-Chwordervosky"," SOON TO BE CLASSIC

"1019","Malcolm and Marie tells us the important yet struggles of a relationship. It is almost as if the movie that Malcolm wrote in the film almost has the same effect on us viewers. Pain , conflict , the passion that was written in the script alll is similar to the movie. I feel as if zendaya did a wonderful job as playing a depresssed drug addict yet intelligent and open minded girl. And John Washington had an even better role playing malcom after seeing his wonderful performance in Tenet. You can feel the tension between the 2 characters and actors.

The directing was phenomenal, I couldn't help but be entranced by the shots throughout.This isn't an exceptionally exciting movie.

"
"1024","This is a fascinating one to read reviews for, including, if not especially, the ones with which I disagree. I think that's because ""Malcolm & Marie"" is explicitly about the creation and appreciation of cinematic art. The two-hander, one-house lockdown set (made as it was during the pandemic) talkfest takes place after the eponymous couple return home on the night of the premiere of Malcolm's debut film, which he wrote and directed. Their series of monologues--organized almost as if they were part of a formal debate, each talking at length largely uninterrupted and each taking time to formulate rebuttals--begin and end over his neglecting to thank Marie, herself a former actress turned ""muse,"" in his public remarks at the premiere. Another focal point of the couple's arguments is an LA Times review of the unseen film-within-the-film. Indeed, the review makes some similar criticisms that have been leveled against ""Malcolm & Marie,"" over authenticity, authorship, gender, race, stylistic choices. It's an argument about artistic values, within the film and continued in reviews of it.I'm a sucker for this sort of reflexive construction. Initially, or instinctively, I had the urge to dismiss it, though, which some others seem to have, as an artsy and self-indulgent stagy exercise in overwrought overacting on black-and-white celluloid. A lot like in some ways two recent filmed plays, both of which I also liked, ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"" and ""One Night in Miami"" (both 2020). All three are unrealistic and dialogue heavy in their own ways where actors are sometimes playing ideas or arguments more than they are characters, and they're all artistically reflexive debates about art. ""Malcolm & Marie,"" however, is more cinematically designed than them, while in form highly reminiscent of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" (adapted from the play in 1966), with so much attention given to composition and the highlighting of that by its unusual nature as a modern black-and-white film. It's also focused on film--down to the celluloid vs digital debate--whereas the other recent movies are more about music or other media.Regardless of whether this is semi-autobiographical of writer-director Sam Levinson's marriage, as filtered through actors John David Washington and Zendaya, and all the gender and racial issues that brings up with a white man telling the story of black characters, one female, within the film the neat suggestion is that it's making itself: that it's the result of the writer-director character, Malcolm, and actress, Marie, having made it themselves--and that it, too, is about talking about a prior film that's also semi-biographical. It's a multi-layered narrative mise-en-abyme. On top of that, the gorgeous high-contrast black-and-white cinematography is often framed through the home's many windows, creating another framing within the already-existent frame of the film--a visual mise-en-abyme alluding to the fact that this is a film. I like, too, how most of the score is diegetic.Of course, this review is a reflection of how I interpret the film and approach cinema in general, while others may be more interested in discussing character deficiencies, the supposed realism, or socio-political issues and especially race, if they don't dismiss it out of hand as artsy, self-indulgent, etc. All valid criticisms, more or less, and I even agree with them in part, but every time a diatribe verged on obnoxious or at least exhausting, it's turned around, just as Malcolm and Marie go tit-for-tat in their verbal abuse and, then, to shared joy, breaking for a cigarette now and again in between. I found a lot of it to be quite funny. A film where the two characters unnaturally speak in long-winded monologues, as photographed in black and white, but which also plays out largely in real time and is so realistic that the camera follows them to the bathroom. Some of Malcolm's anti-academic rants, also for instance, ironically become academic in their criticisms--bringing up race and politics or the male gaze to refute them, as if Levinson were defending against accusations made of ""Malcolm & Marie"" even before it was released. Malcolm's movie criticized for gratuitous nudity while we see Zendaya as Marie in various states of undress, only for Malcolm to point out that if this were a film that could be similarly rebuked. Marie, an actress who may sometimes be acting and as played by a real actress, has her moments, as well, especially at one point when it seems as though the lovers' quarrel has really gone off the rails. It's not whether it's right, or who wins the argument, or even that the picture is profound or pretentious, but it's a thoughtful engagement with film on film.","8","Cineanalyst"," Who's Afraid of the Film Critic?

"1026","The film is 1hr 45 mins.I really like the first 45 minutes. It was funny, well written and well acted and for the most part I was hooked. The black and white looked slick - the cinematography and direction were all really good.However after this there's a 15 minute period where it kinda dips in energy and I started to notice myself checking the time a couple of times.The biggest problem however, comes in the final 45 minutes... because they literally just... repeat the first hour. It follows the same format, arguing back and forth and gets stale way too quickly than it should. It falls into the trap that other contained films do, one where they just kind of run out steam and energy and just ideas of where and how to progress the story forwards. So the end up repeating the same stuff and it becomes, unfortunately, extremely boring.Zendaya and John David Washington are both good but don't make this film worth watching. At least 30 minutes could have been cut and it would've been a lot better, but it wouldn't have solved all the issues.Quite disappointing.

Washington and Zendaya both give stellar performances, working well together with great chemistry.
The film focuses on a theme of critics and how film as an art form is perceived by audiences. There is aggressive dialogue towards the LA Times when reviews start to arrive to Malcolm, which could be controversial, resulting in esteemed critics taking this message to heart.
One flaw I have with the film is that, as amazing as Washington was in the film, there is a moment where he goes a bit over the top, and it starts to become a one man show almost.Overall: 8.4/10","8","jakemelin1217"," Malcolm and Marie

"1032","John David Washington continues to show his dominant and powerful presence as an actor and how prevalent he can be on the screen. Zendaya was not outshined by John David Washington however as she gives a very strong and heartfelt performance. These two actors showed their range, emotion, and talent incredibly well. The writing could have been really bad if it were different actors in the role however John David Washington and Zendaya made some bad lines seem good purely off their performance and talent.Malcolm & Marie depicts emotional trauma, resentment, lust, fame, and heartache in a relationship and the affects it can cause in a fantastic way. Each character has their own monologues about the relationship, their life, or past trauma or past relationships that brutally hurts the other person. The film shows how all of these things in a relationship are detrimental to both people and how it forms toxic emotional attachment which is unhealthy for both people to be in.Where the film falls short is in the run time. This film is not long it stands at an hour and forty six minutes and towards the end of the last act it feels like it is dragging on and they are arguing or talking about the same thing. If this film were a little shorter then it would have had a better impact on people but the end of the film took so long it kind of makes you not invested.

"1035","I'm giving this movie a 10 for artistic quality, story, the fact that it held my attention with only two actors commanding the screen and cinematography. I might have given it an 8 but it scored a bit higher because it gave me a story about black people that didn't mention the typical stereotypical stuff most of us black folks don't identify with, like drugs or crime, or traumatic topics like police violence, slaves, or the white savor trope (i.e., The Help or The Blindside) basically topics Hollywood seems to think black people are limited to or care about. I look for stories about black people that don't insult my intelligence, like a Tyler Perry movie. No screaming adults or ignorant folks (the language Perry seems to think black people think and speak in). I can barely stomach his movies. I can watch and enjoy a Spike Lee movie, who... now that the rest of America is ""woke"" is better understood.Ironically, Spike is mentioned a few times, so the director may have been thinking of Spike when selecting the soundtrack. Or maybe he was thinking of him when he cast David Washington (son of Denzel Washington, who worked with Spike on two of his most important films, three total).What surprised me is that a white director could write black characters so succinctly, much less direct them without reducing the characters or the conflict to stereotypes. David Washington embodying that young cool, black dude swagger, and Zendaya in an unexpected role that was sexier than I was used to, because I still saw her as a girl rather than an adult. So it took a few minutes for me to dismiss any expectations I had about her age.Is the fact that the entire film is black and white a bit pretentious? Yes. Does it work? Yes. Malcolm and Marie held my attention throughout. It's a long movie, but I didn't notice the time passing because I wanted to know what would happen to this couple. I was anxious to find out. Like 2020's The Photograph, I enjoyed it. It's a movie for adults.Maybe we can get back to a time when we have more black films with something to say. Even comedy that has more to say and doesn't involve a black man in drag disguised in an insulting caricature of black women. Maybe we can get back to a time where there were movies like Mo Betta Blues, Jungle Fever, or The Best Man, Love and Basketball, and a few others that left us feeling a certain way.

You don't care for them and feel no sympathy whatsoever.The most annoying part is that Sam Levinson seems to think is the only one who has seen movies by Kieslowski, or Kubrick's Eyes wide Shut, and endlessly references them and steals ideas, but in the end serving no point and no climax.Zandaya dressed the same way as Nicole Kidman in Eyes wide Shut, (a brilliant movie I have seen 20 times, with easter eggs hidden along the way, unlike this piece of garbage). Levinson referencing the idea of deep conversations and fights in EWS, but unfortunately to no result, no creative meaning, no point. Zendaya peeing in an evening gown in the first scene (hello?! Again Eyes wide shut). But why??? Makes no sense, in the nineties this was groundbreaking to show this in cinemas, but now?? Nothing interesting, nothing new.I've gotten already pretty annoyed by Levinson using the soundtrack from Kieslowski's Double life of Vernonique in Euphoria, like it was completely new, his idea, without any references. But this movie beats the cake, because it's fake, boring and pointless, at least Euphoria had a story to tell. Perhaps Levinson thinks the only people seeing Malcolm and Marie will be teenies from Euphoria, treating all his ""borrowed"" ideas as new...
Not to mention that the interior and the wide shots from outside the house with Malcolm dancing in the beginning of the movie are a straight copy of Mia dancing to ""Girl, you'll be a woman soon"" in Pulp Fiction....Most cringe-y scenes: Malcolm eating mac & cheese (this scene will hunt you with its annoyance), Zendaya making weird cringe-y faces, making her look like a teenager and not like an intelligent, wise adult, she's supposed to portray.Sorry to say, but as much as I enjoyed Tenet, in this role Washington is also just plainly annoying, full of himself and not a likeable character...

Makes you think about filmmaking, writing, but mostly life, love and respect.Zendaya with a mesmerising performance. I didn't believe the hype until today (never watched Euphoria). All the emotions are there. She is perfect balancing the right mood for the right moment, even with few words sometimes. It's a crime if she is not nominated for Oscars. The same crime they are ready to commit with Lindo.John David Washington is almost as good as her, on the best performance of his career. Really great dealing with critics (and wannabe critics, like this site is full of), but also with insecurities, the creative process and all it takes from you.Kick the ass of politically correctness and old and new critics stereotypes about men, women or black people.

I felt like I was listening to a neighbors hour long fight but I could not turn away because it was brilliantly done and I wanted to know how it ended. I love this film. This film has classic written all over it. JDW is a brilliant actor, I have been a fan since Ballers. I hope these two do more movies together because this is wonderful. If you have ever had a long conversation or a fight with the one you love you will enjoy this movie. I found myself laughing at JDW when he was fighting while eating mac and cheese, and when he was having an argument with himself outside. I will watch this again.

I genuinely do not understand why this movie has so many negative reviews. Yes, the concept is similar to ""Marriage Story"" and more but is that really a bad thing? We all loved those movies, didn't we?
They took it and made a whole new movie out of it. Filed it in 14 days with a 22 person crew and 2 amazing actors who really know what they were doing.
I'm also happy to see Zendaya in something more mature, even though I love her other characters and productions just as much.

"1065","I must say I was really excited to get immersed in this movie as I saw the trailer, especially seeing Zendaya had a part in it.
Overall, the movie is engaging, shows an awesome acting and performance, the cinematics are on point and the soundtrack is good. For me the win in this is definitely the dialogue that is taken to a very deep yet rational level. You witness the deconstruction of two people analyzing each others points of view and feelings while making a reflection on how they perceive and see each other. Also, how those very same perspectives and behaviors affect them.I think it has a different format from the usual and the way it centers on the psychological realm of two individuals battling to be heard and understood makes it very fascinating and intriguing to watch.On the other hand, I believe the pace of the movie throws away most of the beauty. It quickly switches between intense/loud and calm, with the repetition of these two dimensions becoming exhausting and sometimes dull.The strategic exclusion of some scenes would have elevated the movie and originated a more balanced and gradual development of the plot, keeping the spectator interested. This aspect reveals a certain disappointment, leaving you imagining what could have been a great movie if the duration was reduced and the events sequence was more harmonious.","6","telmamariapaz"," A good movie with great potential that has fallen short

"1067","This film is amazing. The way Zendaya and John did not half ass the scenes kept me from leaving my couch. You can tell the both of them took time to practice and build their emotions throughout the movie. Their chemistry as a couple in this film is top notch; you'll think they are in a REAL relationship. One moment you understand Malcolm's side of the story. While you can also (and DEFINITELY) understand Marie's story.One moment I am amuse, in shock, laughing, sad, and understanding of both characters struggles.' Sam did an amazing job to balance his screenwriting abilities, plotting (directing), and screening each plot. Sam does not skip the storyline. He goes from A, B, C, D, and then back to A. I honestly do not understand some of the critics rating the movie low because of the screenwriting.Personally, the screenwriting is amazing. Sam balanced the whole movie that happened inside of the house, outside of the balconies, and the yard. That is not an easy task to fulfill, but he did it. The critics just do not get the movie or how love and envy in a toxic relationship works. Malcolm and Marie show this and that is why the critics are praising the acting. John and Zendaya delivered, which made the film more enjoyable.Sorry if this is long, I must say how I feel (without spoiling too much) of the film. This film is great and I hope Zendaya, John, Sam, and whoever played apart of the film gets accolades for their work.10/10 - Highly suggest to watch it. Also, Leave Zendaya and John alone. They are grown adults. I don't care how ""young"" Zendaya looks to be John's love interest. In real life, I've seen 20 something year olds with guys not even ten years older than them.

"1068","Overall, Malcolm and Marie is an intense but passionate insight into love and life. The performances from Zendaya and John David Washington are fantastic and it wouldn't be wrong to argue that these are their career best performances to date, their chemistry is there for all to see.

"1071","I liked it, even though I was expecting a lot more, considering I knew who was involved with this film.
The camera work was beautiful, just as expected from Levinson, the acting was good, the set design was really good, the music was about the best part, I think, and the writing was fantastic, but the 'f this/f-ing that's and 'give me a break's got exhausting at some point. It's supposed to make characters more real, annoyed, theatrical and to the point, I get it, but it was like ""less is more"" for the most part.
I was getting a 50s Hollywood, but also a 70s France feeling during some of the shots, which was really interesting and beautiful, but also sometimes quite pretentious.
For me, it was the quirky remarks, funny one liners, Zendaya's middle fingers in the air after proving her point, the little things that made it so enjoyable.
But honestly, I saw someone put this is the ""straight people yelling at each other for two hours"" genre and I don't really disagree.
It's solid, it's worth watching, but I didn't necessarily feel a whole lot as the story was unravelling. I was mostly in awe with the chemestry, because both Zendaya and John were just so captivating, it was excellent. I absolutely loved them together.","6","heyyyoliver"," Less than expected, but it holds up well

"1072","This movie is plain proof that 'great acting' doesn't equate to a great movie. It's obvious that the duo are no amateurs in their
field but it doesn't help if the materials they're given to work with doesn't correlate or just GETS TOO MUCH.Why didn't it work?Zendaya, playing a model slash retired actress and yet having the vocabulary range of Maya Angelou seemed inauthentic. I could understand that from Malcolm, a writer but not Marie. It felt like the writer was more bent on showing off his words than actually creating an authentic character.JDW on the other hand would've been perfect if only he wasn't so loud all the time. His frustrations got me frustrated and it kept going and going on like a vicious cycle. One question I keep asking is, if there was so little material, why make it last for 106 minutes?All these mismatches ended up making them sound less of who they were supposed to be and more of a medium the writer was using to vent out his 'words'. Which is funny because, isn't that the point?The good acting really came through at various moments but it was always immediately replaced by cringe disconnections due to excessively repetitive expository arguments. The characters never really quite clicked.The only difference between Malcolm & Marie and Before Midnight would probably make Levinson bawl his brains out.

However, I think this movie tried too hard to be authentic that some of the dialogue came across as pretentious and the film overall fell short of true authenticity.

It's ambitious in a good way and it does make some valid points on criticism that in turn made many a professional film critic attack the movie for beating them to the punch (of course it would), which further validates its point.

"1085","The young couple of Malcolm and Marie (John David Washington and Zendaya) arrive at an impressive house in Malibu. He is a film maker who has just released his debut feature, and everything indicates that it will be a success. She, an actress who has had addiction problems. Both will engage in a series of recriminations and arguments.Sam Levinson directs this elegant drama, beautifully photographed in black and white and aims to reflect a crisis triggered by that premiere.
Malcolm & Marie has no shortage of themes, which, like theatrical works, reveal ever deeper facets of their characters: inspiration in real people and situations (with their permissions and implications), their relationship with critics, their belongings cultural and racial and its presumed legitimizing role, the link between a director and an actress wife.Malcolm is an outgoing, narcissistic, and partly resentful character. His character begins very ""up"" and borders on the unbearable and from the beginning marks the contrast with the more introverted Marie, who feels displaced.The structure of the film could be summarized as a series of verbal skirmishes in charge of one or the other with successful moments of silence, with a virtuous camera direction that seeks to translate the theatrical essence of the dialogues into cinematographic terms.But unfortunately we are not facing ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" far from it. There is something that is not working (despite the good acting, especially Zendaya's) that hinders the emotional (and also the intellectual) connection with the characters: the lack of dramatic progression and the overly analytical or cerebral nature of the dialogues. and discussions, which erupt almost from the beginning and with little incubation time.Finally, an interesting metafictional aspect is worth noting: Levinson directed Zendaya in the remarkable series Euphoria, with a similar character, but in her adolescence, in such a way that Malcolm & Marie could be seen in this sense almost as a sequel to Euphoria.","6","danybur"," Much ado About Nothing

"1086","""Malcolm and Marie"" done in black and white is clear a discussion and conversation like film that's in the moment and it challenges thought as life and love collide.

The acting and on screen chemistry between the two is tense and great as both of their emotions spill out as they question their sanity and the meaning of love and their current state of being together. The movie may not be everyone's cup of tea still it's thought provoking and makes one see how love, doubt, passion, and life all clash in one.","5","blanbrn"," An in the moment type film that challenges life and love.

Overall rating 64/100
Malcolm and Marie is about a director and his girlfriends relationship which is tested after they return home from his movie premier and await the critics responses. I feel very conflicted over this movie, there was some excellent moments but the movie for me was weighed down by it's significant flaws, so let's get started.First of all, I loved the cinematography, the classic tone the performances and the chemistry between the leads. The movie looked absolutely fantastic, the stylistic choice of making it black and white was an excellent choice, and the set location was truly beautiful, there was just some excellently crafted shots to signify how the characters were feeling in that particular scene, I also loved how classic the movie felt, it felt like it was made in the 60's or 70's with the credits at the beginning and the soundtrack choices it was really refreshing to see. I do have to say that the performances in this movie were absolutely fantastic, they both had heaps of charm and depth to their performances and bought there characters to life in an exciting way, showing great nuance and depth to their performance and different layers to their characters that felt authentic and powerful, and in general they both had excellent on-screen chemistry and bounced off each other excellently on screen, I would gladly see them both work together again.However, my first few negatives would be that there were some repetitive plot points, there was some oddly set up and just unneeded conflict, and the character of Malcolm was not very likeable at all. Due to the movie being very restrictive as it was only set in one location the movie felt very repetitive in places, there was a lot of scenes that were just repeated a lot of the time therefore limiting the movies creative shots and cinematography and just making the film feel not as fresh and creative as perhaps It wanted to be. Also, due to the limited setting a lot of the conflict within the movie felt oddly set up to me, one-minute Malcolm and Marie would really be getting along and then they would walk outside and come back in and start another argument, it just made the pacing very clunky for me and some of the conflict within the movie just felt unnecessary and didn't contribute enough towards the overall plot and depth to both of the characters. I also thought that the character of Malcolm was just very unlikeable, he said some unforgiveable and nasty things to Marie and considering her mental state and the sensitive topics for some of it, Malcolm just came across as nasty and lacked any form of empathy, yes Marie said some hurtful things as well but most of the time she justified and explained why she was saying it and how she was feeling. Malcolm came across as cocky, arrogant, and ungrateful.My final few positives for the movie would be the fantastic script, balance to both of their relationships and the key themes within the movie. The excellent character depth and the development of the plot and characters. The script for this movie for me was the strongest part to Malcolm and Marie, the amount of depth it went into with its characters was astounding, the dialogue was clever and well delivered, with some deep themes on the representation of racism within the media and in film as well as certain aspects of news tabloids and film criticism that really made you think. I thought that the character depth and development of both Malcolm and Marie was truly excellent, this movie laid everything on the table for both these characters, the audience knew every single minor detail to both of the characters and their lives and how they behaved this was well paced out throughout the movie and was an excellent in depth character study of both of these characters. I also loved the balance to both of the characters as well as the themes conveyed to the audience. The movie had an equal balance of showing the flaws to both characters and showing it from both of their perspectives offered a healthy and consistent balance to the movie despite me connecting with and agreeing with what Marie had to say more than Malcolm and having both characters perspectives of the deep themes of the movie was a nice touch offering two different sides to the same issue.My final couple of negatives for the movie that really made it too flawed for me was its dull and emotionally draining tone as well as it's unsatisfying ending. This movie was hard to get through, having repeated arguing for most of the movie with two characters constantly screaming at each other just isn't an exciting premise or idea for an audience to watch, it was emotionally draining, and I had to take a break about halfway through if it had more of a balance of the positive side to their relationship then perhaps it could of worked better but with the amount of arguing in this movie it would have worked better as a short film. I also thought the ending was very unsatisfying in terms of both Malcolm and Marie's arc as a couple and Malcolm's arc. By the end of the movie they should have separated there wasn't any real satisfying closure to their arguing and it just felt like there was too many negative things about their relationship, I felt like the arc for Malcolm was also weak, he apologised but for three seconds it wasn't enough to make his character likeable and he should have been much more willing to try and change and become a better person for Marie but the audience got none of that so therefore it left me very unsatisfied.Overall, Malcolm and Marie boast some great visuals, a well-constructed and deep script highlighting issues with the representation or racism and drug addiction as well as news tabloids in great detail, as well as having some awards worthy performances from John David Washington and Zendaya. However, is too flawed in its repetitive and dull plot that makes it hard to get through, and its flawed structure that left me very unsatisfied with both of the characters relationship, therefore making the film's awards chances very low.","6","rnixon-15663"," Malcolm and Marie

"1096","Aesthetically this movie was amazing, visually beautiful however it did feel too pretentious and repetitive to be authentic. The acting is incredible from both leads in what unfortunately feels like a sloppy script - arguments felt fake and it lacked passion. I ended the movie with no attachment to either character - normally I get quite emotional at any movie, but this just didn't resonate with me at all, both characters just seemed annoying and pretentious. Amazingly artistic but I feel it could have worked better as a short film. Also they both said each other's names way too much to be real.","5","siandrew-57119"," Felt unauthentic but visually is stunning

"1097","Remember when you were out in public - when we could go out in public - and you notice a couple within earshot having a ""discussion."" You're not really doing anything, so you get really quiet so that you can eavesdrop on their back and forth. He says something crazy, and she has a ready comeback. You lean your ear a bit closer, but you're casual about it so they don't notice your nosiness. If it's really juicy, you may get really lost in it and grab some popcorn, but really after about 10 minutes or so, you're bored and you move on to your own life. Malcolm & Marie is that but you're stuck listening to the couple argue for almost 2 hours - well after the initial interest has waned. Malcolm & Marie is this week's big Netflix premiere starring John David Washington and Zendaya in the film produced during last year's COVID-induced lockdown. Here's how I found it.Malcolm & Marie was written and directed by Sam Levinson, who is the creator of HBO's ""Euphoria"". Shot in lush black and white, John David Washington plays Malcolm, a director, whose latest film premiered this night and was well-received; and, Zendaya plays Marie, the director's girlfriend, who comes home after the premiere with tension boiling within. The film is a series of arguments throughout the night between Malcolm and Marie about art, criticism, and the various issues in their relationship. A lot of shouting, primarily from Washington - monologues, pontification, and talk and talk and talk all contained in the rooms of this home.First things first, Zendaya is special. She really can infuse her characters and lines with feeling and energy even when they don't deserve it. Marie is a fine character, but there's not much to it but a sparring partner with Malcolm. Zendaya does her best to give it more and succeeds most of the time. Malcolm is a self-centered, egomaniac and Washington plays into that well enough. The problem with Malcolm is that there is so much talking and shouting that it becomes unbearable. Why is Marie even still there?Secondly, interspersed through all of the talking are some good music cues. The music gives a good respite to the arguing, but it also is supposed to fill in some of those emotional gaps. It is used well and not overdone. The real problem here is that there's no urgency to anything these people talk about. He's screaming about his movie and the critics and blah, blah, blah, even as she's trying to get him to acknowledge her feelings. I was wondering throughout Malcolm & Marie, do I care? When will this be over? And, are these people still fighting? The arguing was just exhausting and not in a good way.Ultimately, there's too much talking and the subject matter of the argument is not interesting, or emotionally fulfilling. This is an argument that you'll want to check-out of early. Even though Zendaya does her best, I only give Malcolm & Marie one popped popcorn kernel and find something else to stream.","4","Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews"," A Quarantine Double Feature, Part 1: Malcolm & Marie

This movie calls back to the early 60's independent arthouse projects when they wanted something less surreal or abstract to draw in more people. It harkens back to scripts from the likes of Ibsen, and on that note can easily be translated to stage.
The acting is top-notch, the language is hard-hitting, and the cinematography is beautiful. It shows that art can easily prevail through even the worst pandemic.

"1104","Malcolm & Marie is a movie that starts with the fine performance of both Zendaya and John David Washington and also ends with it without anything special in the middle other than the performance. The story that this movie delivers us is the one on one conversation between the two actors. Both the actors put all their dedication behind their performance which makes us wanna grind those scenes. It makes us wanna watch their performance again and again considering the fact that how well it's made. Screenplay needed some work. One thing that really struck the presentation of the movie is the cinematography and the grayscale tone was a big part of it.

"1105","*WARNING: MINOR SPOILERS*When I heard John David Washington and Zendaya were gonna be together in this film, I got excited. Despite their brilliant performances, I have mixed feelings towards this film.Malcolm & Marie takes place during one night where Malcolm and Marie's relationship is tested after Malcolm's movie premiere as they wait for critics' reviews.First of all, I have to admit it's impressive how they were able to make this film during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the restrictions they had to place to keep the set safe and its low budget, Malcolm & Marie is a gorgeous looking film that features fantastic performances from both actors. I've been rooting for John David Washington ever since I first saw him in BlacKkKlansman and here he delivers one of his best performances yet. At times I did feel he went over the top but for the most part, he put a lot of passion and emotion into his character. Zendaya is easily the biggest surprise for me in this film. I haven't seen her act extremely well before until now. Her character is much more subtle than Washington's but she deserves every ounce of praise she gets for her portrayal as Marie. Zendaya is certainly the highlight of the film.Whilst the performances may be strong, I have issues with the story itself. The film is essentially a 1 hour 45 minute argument and after a certain point it becomes repetitive. After a point, I understood the structure and that's where I didn't engage with the film as well as I did at the start. They fight, then they make up for a short time, then they fight, and then make up again. The formulà became repetitive and dragged the film as a result. The film is very gorgeous to look at and I feel the black and white suited the film well. The camerawork is also stellar. There is a fantastic one take sequence towards the beginning which gave the actors a lot of room to work with. Sam Levinson's script has a lot to say. It's evident that there is a lot of anger built up inside Levinson that he wants to get off his chest especially during a scene where Washington goes on a long rant bashing a critic. Levinson's film talks about relationships, critics and filmmaking through its runtime which does promote for interesting discussions. At the same time, there are moments where the dialogues feel like they're being read off a page instead of sounding natural and that's not due to the performances but more on the script being overwritten. Like Ma Rainey's Black Bottom and One Night in Miami, this film does also feel more like a play than a film.Malcolm & Marie is one of those films that will split audiences. There are aspects to appreciate but had Levinson put more time in perfecting the script, Malcolm & Marie could have been better.","6","ronakkotian"," Extraordinary acting in a film that ends up getting repetitive

"1111","IN BRIEF: Fine acting covers up some flaws in the story department in this well directed two character drama.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) After a successful movie premiere, filmmaker Malcolm Elliott and his girlfriend Marie return home to ""discuss"" the events of the evening, or more so, their imploding relationship. It seems he made the ultimate public faux pas: a glaring omission of not thanking his beloved for her undying support. The verbal fireworks are lit in Sam Levinson's two character drama. Malcolm and Marie. However it appears that director/ writer also forgot to thank Edward Albee too.Now if you are planning to do a two person drama, then you best have a script filled with thought-provoking dialog and a duo of actors who know their craft. Kinda to the former, a definite yes to the latter.
After all, words become the action in this scenario. In fact, they matter the most. Malcolm & Marie loses track of that fact as the couple bicker and yell and their topics range from ex-girlfriends, white privilege, mediocrity, and famous film directors with much talk in-between about love and hate. This marathon plays out in real time, so this nearly two hour gabfest exhaust rather than enlightens. After all, when was the last time you made your significant other feel insignificant by calmly saying, ""I can snap you like a twig"". Such sweet talk!Filmed during the COVID quarantine, this film maximizes its social distancing in showing an unhappy couple with deep-rooted commitment issues. It also keeps its distance from its moviegoers, which is not a good thing. Throughout this long morning hour session, our temperamental filmmaker and his ex-addict girlfriend throw themselves into sadomasochistic behaviors that would rival George or Martha, but the payoff feels incomplete.Mr. Levinson sets-up his drama with various rants about art, guilt, and shame in his first act and finally questioning authenticity in his second act, a quantity that his film lacks. Often, the dialog seems contrived and manipulative. The film never builds to a satisfying conclusion and one wonders why these two would ever stay in this combative relationship. He is so narcissistic and egotistical with definite anger issues; she is unable to admit her own flaws and jealousy issues.Now, dear moviegoer, you would think I could not recommend this film from my words thus far...but I do. Although some of you would not enjoy this movie at all, there is much to admire here. Mr. Levinson solidly directs his fight scenes with style, even if he sometimes fumble with his wordplay. This is not to say that his screenplay doesn't have insight and bravado. It does, many times over. But where the film truly excels is in its quieter moments and its use of a soundtrack playlist that helps convey the emotional wreckage this couple endures. The fluid b&w cinematography by Marcell Rév is some of the best you will see this year. And foremost is the talented cast of two who are building quite an impressive resume.John David Washington has the more difficult role as Malcolm. As written, his unpleasant character is angry and angrier. Not a wide range, but he does rage very well. He also brings some charisma and nuance to his underwritten role. This is his personal best and one is greatly encouraged to see more of his future work. Zendaya has the better written part as both victim and attacker. She creates a vivid figure, showing her character's determination and vulnerability. Her final seven minute ""thank you"" speech is mesmerizing and the actress may earn some accolades just for that speech alone. Both actors handle the movie's frequent lengthy monologues most astutely and their chemistry together makes the film more palpable.Like that proverbial glass of water, Malcolm and Marie asks its philosophic questions about life, but yet the debate remain unanswered. Is it half empty, half full...or all wet? (GRADE: B-)NOTE: See the recent drama, Marriage Story (2019), for a definitive film on this subject very done well. It's sheer poetry.","7","jadepietro"," Well Acted but Lacking in Authenticity

"1112","Malcolm & Marie is an extremely intimate and exhausting (in the best way possible) film.
The whole runtime is filled with pretty much one huge argument with some breathing room in between. It was very engaging and was carried heavily by amazing performances by both John David Washington and Zendaya.
Malcolm & Marie also has some pretty gorgeous yet simple cinematography combined with black and white coloring that just made the film feel weighted down and emotional.
Yes, this film is really just one huge argument with no big plot. But it's simplicity and beauty is really what makes this film shine.","8","chandean-69762"," Malcolm & Marie 2021 Review
"
"1113","Malcolm & Marie follows an extremely simple premise of a filmmaker and his girlfriend coming home after the premiere of his movie, and then proceed to argue for almost the entire night. There are a couple of things to unpack here.First of all, the positives.
Both actors deliver. John David Washington is oustanding, and continues his run of excellent performances over the last couple of years. His character is very expressive and intense, and you can clearly see he's all for it.
Zendaya's star is still rising, and she also delivers in a genre that has up until this point been uncharted territory for her. Her character leaves a little to be desired at the start, where she seems somewhat monotone and held back, but she later gets her moments to shine and totally nails them.
The relationship between the two characters portrayed by these actors feels and seems authentic, with all manner of genuine relationship issues being covered and discussed.
There's also John David Washington's rant on how contemporary movie reviewers tend to look for things that aren't there in movies and try to make everything political, which I just liked.There are some issues I feel like I have to address.
The movie feels too long, and most of that has to do with the dialogue.
There are quiet moments, but the movie is otherwise stuffed with dialogue. The movie follows a pattern of a constant back-and-forth between the two leads, with long speeches or rants given by each one at a time. There's some impressive acting here, but this schtick does get repetitive and is not as interesting or poignant as it's supposed to be. The dialogue is furthermore very exposition heavy, which is logical given that the movie largely plays out in real time and we don't get to see any details about the characters' past. Also, the script makes use of a lot of big words and some very coherent sentencing, which to me makes the whole conversation feel a little too fabricated.
There's also the fact that the movie is shot in black and white, which honestly doesn't really add anything. The camerawork and editing are still very much done in a contemporary style, so the supposed authenticity one is meant to gain from shooting in black and white is somewhat lost.All in all, the starts deliver, but the movie's premise and execution are just not that interesting or innovative. 6 / 10","6","roel-willemsen"," Flawed, just like the characters

"1114","I feel like I wasted valuable time watching this movie. It did nothing for me. JDW was all over the place in this movie. Sometimes it even came off as he was rambling.

I don't know what the movie was trying to accomplish by doing it such a short time and by filming it during the high of the pandemic. You will have more questions of why after watching this movie.

"1118","""It's not just about you forgetting to thank me, Malcolm. It's about how you see me. And how you view my contribution.""I've waited a little bit to write this review. The first reactions were all positive, then critics became divided with it, and now the general public thinks it's just ok. Malcolm & Marie may not have captivated all audiences, but I for one found it to be a well-done film. The premise follows a filmmaker returning home with his girlfriend following a celebratory movie premiere as he awaits what's sure to be imminent critical and financial success. The evening suddenly takes a turn as revelations about their relationships begin to surface, testing the strength of their love. How I like to describe it is think of the worst argument from Marriage Story and stretch it out for almost two hours. Also add some Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? into the mix. Sam Levinson has made a name for himself with the success of Euphoria. Here, he seizes the opportunity to discuss relationships, worth, and critics. Malcolm & Marie was one of the first films to be shot during the pandemic. The story works in its favor since it only calls for two actors and one location. Zendaya and John David Washington are electric together. We see both the best and worst of the characters. Zendaya gives an award worthy performance. She and Levinson have a great understanding of each other that brings the best of her acting out. And John David Washington gives an excellent performance as well. I love seeing how the two quickly have risen as actors. The amount of work put in by the two is outstanding. Some monologues last minutes long. It's crazy how they could memorize all of that and deliver breathtaking scenes. Literally, I felt like I had to hold my breath the hold time with how intense it gets.What I love about the screenplay is how it doesn't take a side. Obviously, there are a few scenes where it focuses on the needs of one over the other, but you can see both sides. There's also a deepness to it that some may not see. Many will view this as a long argument, and I get that. I do think it uses every minute to voice some sort of topic whether it's about a character or pertaining to real life. The part that I thought was a bold move is kind of bashing critics. As you might imagine, some critics didn't like that. But if you listen to what it has to say, it's all true. I will say there are some flaws within the screenplay. For one, it does feel repetitive at times. There's a distinct setup of arguing followed by the two making-up someway. And that happens multiple times. Also some reaction to their criticism to each other feels strange. For example, John David Washington at one point essentially tells Zendaya how broken she is, and Zendaya just smiles. Accepting something like that felt almost wrong. There are a few instances of this. Also, the beginning of the third act has a very strange scene that feels all too abrupt considering all that has happened. It's resolved quickly but it felt so strange and intense that I didn't know where it would go. The issues I have are about specific parts, but I'd rather not spoil the film.Sam Levinson has an eye for the look of a film or episode. The choice to use black-and-white for one looks gorgeous. It also has a lot to say within the context of the film. Most will realize the basic significance of right-or-wrong to a conversation, but with other topics discussed it only adds to the effectiveness. Also, the house they're in looks phenomenal. It's big and they use the space well. The blocking is fantastic. As a stage play, this would work well. If that was the intention, the cinematic approach is done well. I understand all of the division with the film. Many criticisms that I've seen prove a point that I can get behind also. And some just hate it saying it's too pretentious. However, I will be one to support Malcolm & Marie (and hope that Zendaya could get a nomination for the Oscars even if it's not likely at this point). I can't say that I could recommend this to everyone, but give it a chance and listen to what it has to say.","8","sweidman-28016"," Great Despite the General Criticisms

"1120","Seems like the screenplay for this movie resulted from the aftermath of several therapy sessions Sam Levinson might have gone to.The acting is fine, except for the fact that Zendaya looks too young to be JDW's wife and I find it difficult to believe people would actually use such complicated words in the middle of an argument.Overall, it is a fairly boring movie about two people arguing but what really irritates me is the use of black and white. It is pretentious and pandering to the extreme, as if to say ""Look, this is a deep movie about the underlying friction between two people who love each other and it's shot in black and white so it is awards material"".Watch it if you have nothing else to do, or if you like Zendaya and/or JDW or you are curious about the movie (all three reasons I watched it).

If instead you are intrigued by the functioning of the human psyche, by the dynamics of human relationships, by the impact of emotions and of their expression (or lack thereof), then you'll probably like Malcolm&Marie .
From a cinematographic standpoint, the movie is sustained by great screenplay and dialogues enacted by superlative acting; so much so that the whole thing might look at times as overdone, hence self-indulgent and self-conscious.

"1123","It reminds me in concept at the trilogy of the ""before"" movies with Ethan Hawk and Julie Delpy.While those three movies are amongst my favorites of all time, Malcolm & Marie Does not quite deliver on that level.I love the actors, the black and white film material, the architecture, the camera. Stylistically its great. The actors do a solid job too.Unfortunately the substance of the conversations is not really that interesting for a longer movie. As a short this could have worked, but contrary to the ""before"" series, where chemistry, flow and depth of the conversations really blow your mind and you get moments of relatebility, in this movie you get a message of fragility and brokenness, but beyond that is very little intellectual or emotional stimulation.Also after a while the constant swearing gets on your nervs. I get that they are fighting, but the overuse of the swear words is weakening the dialogue and its impact.Just not enough there, but i still applaud and love the efforts.Very talented trio at work, but the material is too thin, the dialogues not sharp, witty or observant enough to make it interesting.","6","Felixhug"," Thin on substance, otherwise great

"1129","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)At the time of this review, Malcolm & Marie is already dividing critics worldwide, which is far from being surprising, having in mind its expectedly provocative premise. Being a film critic isn't exactly an easy task, especially when it comes to deal with public opinion. In most cases, when one reaches a high level of success, that always comes with a heavy dose of offensive tweets and personal attacks, particularly when the author's opinion contradicts the audience's response. So, I was hoping that Sam Levinson would not contribute to the dozens of misconceptions surrounding film criticism and hundreds of conspiracy theories regarding journalists of the respective area...Unfortunately, the extremely exaggerated, borderline offensive, over-the-top monologues - kind word for rants - delivered by Malcolm (John David Washington) are simply more wood thrown to the already devastating fire. What starts as a surprisingly rational, thought-provoking comment on how (some) critics tend to make movies about something these aren't attempting to be - mainly emphasizing a non-existent political or racial message - quickly evolves to scenes featuring a childish, immature, self-absorbed behavior from the male protagonist, who blindly attacks hypothetical reviews from, in his opinion, horrible critics. Even though this is somewhat of a niche subject for the general audience, it's still a negative contribution to a challenging problem film critics face every day.I've read the following comment more than a couple of times already: ""Sam Levinson is using a Black actor to transmit his white male director's frustrations on the industry's reviewers"". In my opinion, whoever wrote something similar to this is falling into the exact same error Malcolm aggressively accuses critics of doing: reading too much into it, and once again, bringing race to a discussion where it doesn't belong. It doesn't really matter if the screenplay is written by a frustrated Levinson who decided to let out his thoughts about film criticism or by someone else entirely. Ultimately, the characters are one of the main pillars of any movie, and sadly, they're my main issue with the whole story.Despite the prologue above that I couldn't help not writing, Malcolm & Marie focuses on the toxic relationship of the two unlikable protagonists. The adjectives used in the last sentence are hardly untrue. Malcolm and Marie spend almost the entire runtime in a tiresome, exhausting, headache-inducing cycle of incredibly exaggerated fights followed by a temporary reconciliation by making out for a couple of minutes before the next big argument begins. As soon as I finished the film, Marriage Story came to my mind, and I vividly remember tearing up when the main characters had that massive fight. Why did I feel so bothered and uncomfortable with Malcolm and Marie then? Because of their personalities.Malcolm is nothing more than a cocky, egocentric, self-indulgent filmmaker who believes he's the king of the world now that he delivered a good movie. Pride and arrogance are separated by a thin line, but Malcolm definitely incorporates the arrogant persona who can't even show signs of gratitude when positive reviews come in - instead delivers another rant on how the respective author didn't understand his film. On the other hand, Marie (Zendaya) starts as an apparently nice, hardworking, lovable young woman who just got stuck with the wrong man, seemingly working as the equilibrium point in their relationship. I do feel sorry for a lot of things that happened to her. However, Marie quickly demonstrates that she's far from being a perfect girlfriend.Despite being much more tolerable and less unlikable than Malcolm, Marie carries unforgivable mistakes from her past and shows an inability to accept that Malcolm might have drawn inspiration from someone else. With constant attempts at victimization and a certain amount of jealousy, Marie is the trigger for most of the arguments that come up out of nowhere each time the two reconcile. In the end, this is the reason why I felt so much more emotionally invested in the protagonists of Marriage Story: I deeply cared about these characters and their respective lives. Not only I understood what drove them apart, but I could actually relate to some of it. Malcolm might have made a beautiful movie partially based on his relationship with Marie, but it's still a toxic, damaging romance that no one should ever need to deal with.Even though the before-mentioned problems are indeed heavy negatives, Malcolm & Marie still possesses a lot of qualities worthy of deep appreciation. Levinson might share the same views on film criticism as Malcolm, but his talent as a director is undeniable. His brilliant use of excruciatingly long takes plays a significant role in elevating the intensity and attention levels of every dialogue and monologue. Marcell Rév's cinematography - who previously worked with Levinson in Euphoria - is either based on tracking shots to follow each character across the never-ending halls and rooms of the house or static images to let the actors shine in their line deliveries. Rév waits for just the right moment to finally move the camera near the character after extensive, uncut minutes of impressive work from the movie's absolute standouts: the actors.John David Washington's performance in Tenet wasn't universally loved, and even though I really enjoyed his display, I didn't know where his career would go from there. Well, his portrayal of Malcolm may be a bit too over-the-top for some people's taste, but despite my despise for the character, only a blind viewer would not value Washington's outstanding interpretation. In a surprisingly more physical display than I anticipated, Washington literally offers his entire body and voice to his character, not forgetting a single facial expression or body movement. As uncomfortable as his rants on film criticism are, I have to show appreciation for the actor's ability to actually make me feel like that.Nevertheless, this is Zendaya's show. In fact, I won't be surprised by the inevitable nominations coming her way. For someone who never watched Euphoria or only has her performance as MJ in Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home as an example, her portrayal of Marie will surely shock many viewers. From the incredible control of subtle emotions certain scenes ask for to the extremely captivating monologues - something both actors tackle superbly - Zendaya delivers her career's best performance in a feature film. An emotionally powerful display that I won't forget so soon. A final praise to Labrinth's score, which plays a meaningful part in the storytelling.Malcolm & Marie is technically impressive - gorgeous cinematography and impactful score - boasting two phenomenal performances, but its complicated screenplay and characters push me to the negative side. From the overly exaggerated, almost offensive rants on film criticism and the area's professionals to the tiresome, over-the-top cycle of fight-reconciliation, Sam Levinson's undeniable talent as a director is overpowered by the two incredibly unlikable protagonists who are mutually damaging each other in their unquestionably toxic relationship. Despite the exceptionally captivating effort from John David Washington and especially Zendaya, who delivers a career-best interpretation, the feeling of discomfort and distress never goes away. Malcolm is a completely intolerable, arrogant filmmaker, and even though I genuinely felt sorry for Marie at one point, the latter eventually proves that she's far from being a better person. Since one of its central topics of discussion is a bit too niche for general audiences, it will probably find its commercial success through Netflix. Personally, it's my first major disappointment of 2021.Rating: C","4","msbreviews"," Malcolm & Marie boasts two phenomenal performances, but its complicated screenplay and characters push me to the negative side.

"1133","Lockdowns can do many things. Highlight tension, force you to pick up a new hobby, look within yourself and see all of the ugliness, bore you out of your skull or make you appreciate yourself and others around you more.This film seems to contain all of these elements. Malcolm is a filmmaker who returns home from a premier of his latest film and Marie is his girlfriend who sullenly makes him Mac and Cheese. She becomes gradually and increasingly upset that Malcolm didn't thank her in his acceptance speech. It transpires that she is a recovering drug addict whom Malcolm partially based the lead character on in his new movie.As a play, this probably would have worked better. As a film, it's way too long. The characters go constantly back and forth with their arguments, their anger and their frustration, playing off each other. Making up and then not making up, and vice versa.The performances are very good and Zendaya proves her serious acting chops in this one.

I don't believe anyone speaks with such eloquence in real life, especially in a fight where your emotions take over. It is a shame, as this could have been a potentially good short film. In addition, the scenes were stretched to the point they didn't make sense anymore. Malcolm's entire rant about the review was too overdone and it felt like the writer only tried to make every scene longer to get to a two hour film. Also, I feel as though the writer tried to hard to come across as artistic and original and made it seem very fake. All in all, it is watchable and a good way to see what mistakes to look out for when writing a script.","5","enyakvarantan"," Shallow and streched

"1136","This movie failed to impress me. If you like a bit of plot surprise and prefer that the character's subtext is somewhat veiled, beware. The writing is a tired loop, which tortures the viewer with it's obsessive, relentless details. The pacing was also stagnant.Malcolm and Marie is written and directed by Sam Levinson, who has done some episodes of ""Euphoria"", which I really liked. But this movie feels like a vanity piece which is straining in a ""cool"" way to be relevant to Black people. Or maybe he is trying to show that all races of people have the same type of arguments.One ironic thing is that part of dialogue refers to film critics, but Levinson's redundant dialogue is as bothersome as the character who is irritated by critics. Who knows, maybe this ""picture within a picture"" is intended. Or, perhaps one of the director's goals was to emulate the filmmaker John Cassavetes, who so lucidly revealed the raw complexity of human interactions.I did appreciate the commitment of the actors (although several scenes were overacted by JDW). There was lovely cinematography and production design. But these elements cannot rescue this. At about the 30 minute mark, I found myself literally shaking my head, while groaning aloud ""oh, no"".I hope that Zendaya chooses her projects more carefully. She deserves better.","3","seemingly_reel"," Failed to Impress - Lackluster Writing

Makes me sad how us people are willing to hurt the people we love the most and it actually happens so often, actually I do it all the time. Its a reminder that we all do it and maybe we should not.

It would have been an amazing short, but there's not enough going on to justify its 100 minutes. The conversations become repetitive, with the characters talking about the same subjects for too long. They keep coming back to the same issues and fighting and making up and then fighting again for THE SAME REASONS. Also Malcom's monologues are very unatural to me (not an acting issue but more of a script issue, the words he use, the whole structure of the speech is just not realistic).In the end, this left a strange taste in my mouth. Analyzing the scenes separately you're able to fully enjoy the performances from the talented leads but watching the movie as a whole you just get...bored.","5","gg2507"," Great acting, terrible pacing

"1145","In my opinion this film is not as much about the relantionship as i first thought.I feel like their relantionship problems are what keeps the film interesting for most spectators but the the directors true objective was to critique some things about the film industry and specially the way they are perceived. The points made are really good and gave me a new perspective so i really enjoyed that side of the movie.The writing was too eloquent making the fight a little bit unrealistic. I feel like that was a sacrifice by the director as he wanted to make his points very clear and in a normal fight no one woud be able to make such points so clearly.In conclusion, it is not an easy movie to digest as it can get a little bit too repetitive. It is worth watching nevertheless as it makes you think and also keeps you curious all throughout the movie.","7","tonyfp"," Misunderstood
"
"1146","If it weren't for the first 50 minutes and some brilliant performance throughout by the leads, i would've given this movie less than this.
The movie is... i don't know what this movie is really. Sam Levinson was just trying to create a dramatic art. Sure it has drama, a lot! Sure it is artistic in a way, but what happened after the first 50 minutes? If you noticed the movie, watched the movie, the way i did, you'll see when the movie started to fall apart.The first half of the movie genuinely hooked me up to watch a new type of Drama. The acting is Brilliant, it's superb. Washington and Zendaya are at their best here. Just classic. I wouldn't even mind if they get multiple nominations or even wins.They essentially gave the tone, gave the movie, that Dramatic Feeling.
But after some time, it was okay to leave the cycle of repetitive arguments. But the director didn't. The movie is just like: They fight a lot, they start cuddling and love, they fight again, they start making love again, the again fight and sooooo on. It became annoying at a context, that i had my earphones in my ears, movie playing on my laps in phone, but my concentration was on my doggie. I was playing with him while the movie was running in back. I wasn't even interested at a point that what would happen now. The way the first half, first 50 minutes opend, it was really brilliant. I really loved them and also thought that the movie would be a great ride. But after that it just became boring and annoying. There was no point of the movie. Levinson didn't focused that the movie had to go somewhere, to achieve a satisfying climax. But instead just kept the arguments on the core. At the end, the climax, the conclusion was sooo unsatisfactory. It made me thought: What was the point of the movie? What just happened? Are there sooo much convolutions and misunderstanding in a relationship? I really don't think so.. and if yes, HOW? LOL the movie made a joke here. All i wanna say, after the first BRILLIANT half, the movie missed the execution and potential. I was even ready to see a Brutal or Negative outcome at a point. But NOTHING HAPPEND IN THE MOVIE! I was bored as hell.. even the arguments, which felt nice in the first half, became boring and sooooo long afterwards. I wasted my 1 hr 40 mins of sleep. And had to wake up my dog just to pass the time.","5","thevision-44664"," Malcolm and Marie: Movie Review
"
"1147","I'm in the middle when it comes to this film. I appreciated the format it's done in. I have understood this was a last minute decision since this was one of the productions affected by the pandemic. It's done like a play, a format you don't see often in recent movies. It reminded me of 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' in terms of the way it was filmed with elements of 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ?' It's a movie where you have to pay attention to the dialogue to know what's going on. However, as much as I like that they chose this format, I don't think it worked out for them and the repetitive dialogue doesn't help either.I like the points it brings up about movie critics who use their critiques as a way to show off their college education, sometimes making connections that aren't present for the sake of appearing oh, so intellectual. Obviously this struck a nerve with the Los Angeles Times, since they panned this movie and mentioned the reference that's made to them in their critique. Both characters mock the little ""white girl"" movie critic from the LA Times who is bent on appearing ""woke"" in her critiques yet is just as (if not more) racist as the critics on the other side of the aisle. I loved these observations that were made in the dialogue, I agree with many of them. My only issue is that they can be dragged out to death and I'm not sure if that's to fill up the movie's runtime but I feel that some of it could've been cut back a bit. Malcolm in particular is the character that can stay talking forever about one subject. One scene that comes to mind is after he's read the ""little White girl's"" critic's review on the LA Times website and he goes on a whole rant about how these type of critics add to the race problem rather than solve it. They complain about the white savior trope by playing the role of the white savior, themselves, in real life. Very valid points, but Malcolm stays on this tangent for way too long to the point that he's very repetitive.Some of the lines Malcolm and Marie are made to say don't sound natural, they sound like spoken essays. Which is ironic considering they both discuss how cringe it is for movie critics to feel the need to flex their college education by making everything sound like a cultural studies essay. The main conflict in the film is that Malcolm forgot to thank Marie in the speech about the film he just released which is loosely based on Marie's life and her struggles with addiction. We go back and forth between the two protagonists arguing who's the problematic one in the relationship. Infidelities are revealed, character analyzations are made, Mac 'n' Cheese dishes are made on this hectic night. Who wins the arguing in the end ? No one. Personally I sided with Marie throughout the whole film cos she definitely was the smarter one between the two and definitely deserved at least a small nod in this dude's speech since it's obvious that she was his muse regardless of the other struggling addicts he's met.In terms of acting, both do a pretty good job. I felt John David Washington kind of tried too hard in some scenes. A whole lot of yelling on his part to play the frustrated/ misunderstood director and boyfriend. Zendaya on the other hand is more subtle and her gorgeous, expressive face says more than any of the lines she's given. Maybe Washington's yelling and Zendaya's coolness is supposed to balance it out, but because of the fact that this movie drags on, that balance gets lost. All in all, the play format didn't succeed with this film because the dialogue was repetitive. A point was made 3 scenes back and it's brought up again but with no new insight to offer. It's hard to have any form of attachment with these characters, I did with Zendaya's Marie, but for the general audience I don't think you care whether they stay together or not or who's right or who's wrong, the movie goes nowhere. I see what the director was trying to do but it just didn't work out. This movie couldn't survive in the play format, those other sets and characters were needed to really let this story come to life and do these characters justice. If the script was revised and cut back I still don't think the movie would have succeeded the way it is now. Perhaps they should've waited until the pandemic was over to continue working on this film.
Right now it's just a writing outlet on the screen for the director where he let his inner battles and thoughts loose with a couple's story in the background.","6","stefstars"," Makes Good Points but Dragged Out

"1148","""It's not just about you forgetting to thank me, Malcolm. It's about how you see me. And how you view my contribution; not just to this relationship, but to your work. Specifically, in a movie you made about my life."" Marie (Zendaya)
If you've ever wondered why a film or play has been called a ""two hander,"" here's a fine example: writer-director Sam Levinson's Malcolm & Marie. No other actors are needed, thank you. These two, John David Washington as Malcolm and Zendaya as Marie, eat up the lines without eating up the scenery without other actors.
Living together, they wait at their lavish beach home for the reviews of his new film, whose premiere from which they have just returned. Fueled by passion, narcissism, and plain old intelligence, they argue about the authenticity of his directing and the elements of the film based on her life as a recovering addict (See quote above). Think of just Taylor and Burton in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? without the two younger characters (in fact, the name of the unseen actress in his new film is ""Taylor"").Through cycles of bitterness and love, the two characters in Malcolm define many of the important elements of art, most about the honesty of character and point of view or perspective of the artists. But underneath is the nagging is our suspicion that their solipsistic obsession with their craft keeps them from fully loving each other.This romantic depiction of the conjunction of life and art is to be sipped like a fine Cognac, perhaps revisited to savor the brilliant script and watch two fine actors update the histrionics of Burton and Taylor into modern minimalism.

"1149","So, I was kind of excited to see this film. I think Zendaya was great in Euphoria and John David Washington seems to have a good talent. Also, I was intrigued by the fact that the movie was in black and white.From the beginning to let´s say somewehere in the middle of this film, I was invested in it, I listened to the dialogues carefully and enjoyed most of it. But then I just couldn´t keep my attention anymore and the movie became so very repetative for me. And yes, I mean it repeated itself over and over again. All the points they made, it was repeated.The vizuals were nice, the acting was okay. But I couldn´t bother with its content anymore, with the back and forth between the two characters, so just spaced out totally and at the very end I really couldn´t wait for it to end already. And that right there is just not a good enough movie for me that it makes me wish it would end. The movies I love, I watch them over and over again and fully enjoy every minute, even the longer ones.So, I give it a 5 out of 10, because acting was okay, vizuals were nice and the theme of it had potential and I could relate to some if it. I just really really wish it would have been a bit more exciting, thought provoking and not so repetative.","5","inker-13614"," Almost unique, almost very good

"1150","Malcolm & Marie is the newest film from Sam Levinson, produced during Quarantine, and starring John David Washington and Zendaya. It takes place over the course of one night and details a fight between Malcolm, an up and coming filmmaker, and his girlfriend Marie. The argument stems from Malcolm forgetting to thank Marie in his speech before his film's premiere.It's an excuse to showcase John David Washington and Zendaya as performers. Two performers who I have lukewarm feelings about to begin with. Both are good in the film, but the acting is very stage-y. It all does feel like a play, but after like ten minutes, I just accepted the style. They work well together and have pretty fun chemistry. In fact, both are so good, they almost distract me from the glaring weaknesses of the script.I will say that for the first part of the film, I was really digging it. The low-fi aesthetics with the quick snappy dialogue really put me in the mood. The main issue of this film is that it is a one location, two character, movie. Neither the location, nor the issue between the characters are dynamic enough to sustain the momentum the film is going for. What really sucks is, since there is a restriction of time and space, we don't get to see anything of this relationship outside of this one hour. Not saying that you need that, but it might help let us in to the argument a bit more.Taken as a whole, Malcolm & Marie is an interesting experiment that I don't think fully pays off, but there are some strong elements. I think this subject matter deserves a better film, and maybe one day we'll get it, but for now? This is fine.But I have to ask: what has happened to Sam Levinson? The provocateur, the rebel, the absurdist. The guy who made the truly bonkers pop-satire Assassination Nation, and staged that breathtakingly gorgeous carnival sequence in the fourth episode of Euphoria? Why has he been replaced by this stoic, self serious, drama mama, just bleeding my time with these emo dirges? It's almost as if Levinson refuses to acknowledge his own artifice, trying to trick you into thinking that his characters are deeper and more complex than they are.","6","anthonygiancola24"," It's Fine

""A Marriage"" was another recent film that pursued deeper examination of relationships within the confines of the human condition. This film left me wrung out in that very satisfying way that ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff"" did, and in the way that only exceptional writing, directing and acting can.

"1153","Malcolm and Marie is a pulchritudinous, realistic but suffocating film about an ostentatious, navel-gazing filmmaker (John David Washington) and his recovering addict, relentless girlfriend (Zendaya) that come home after Malcolm's (Washington) first movie premiere. During the film the couple toxically argue over and over, make up, tease the audience with a sex scene and Marie (Zendaya) exhaustingly and frustratingly starts arguing with Malcolm again. It's a cycle that becomes more monotonous every time it begins. Within half an hour it becomes conspicuous that this is going to be the entire narrative. Despite this, cinematically it is beautiful and unique in appearance and has that quality of a ""film having a heart"", to quote Malcolm. An excellent film for filmmakers; but a tedious one for everybody else.","4","tallulahdenyer"," Tedious, titillating and turbulent

"1154","Over the past few years, a black and white movie trend has been unveiling itself. ""Malcolm and Marie"", is a modern-day love story, written and directed by Sam Levinton, starring Zendaya and John Washington. Fully shot in black and white, and accompanied by some great pieces of jazz, it unfolds into an unsettling discussion, about adulthood, Hollywood, racism, sexism, and love.The film begins with a questionable opening scene, and although it does its purpose, introduces us to our main characters, main topic, and the set, it feels empty and somewhat senseless. Malcolm, a young and upcoming filmmaker, who has just premiered his first positively criticized movie, and his partner Marie, a failed actress, that ended up becoming a model, and has a very shady past after some drug-related problems earlier in her life. Both set the mood for a strong heart-to-heart argument between them that lasts the whole movie. Zendaya worked with Sam Levinton in his successful streaming show, ""Euphoria"", and John had just recently worked with Cristopher Nolan in his 2020 blockbuster ""Tenet"".As I see it, the movie is an authentic acting challenge. Two actors filling the screen for almost two hours is astonishing, and something to take into consideration before criticizing the acting. With that said, Zendaya was by far superior to John Washington. Just like in ""Tenet"", John Washington takes too long to adapt himself to the movie, and only half away thought it he levels with the amazing actress that Zendaya is. But above all, I believe blaming the actors would be unfair. The argument is, to say the least, horrible. It's pretentious and wants to be so much more than what it needs to. Sam Levinton must have some trauma with critics, and although some truth about the Hollywood world is in fact said, most of it feels like the writer wanting to show how much more he knows about cinema than his critics. There is no doubt in my mind, that this movie was pressured to hit the one hour and forty-five-minute mark.As far as cinematography goes, the camera work is mediocre, with some very interesting shots, but nothing truly beautiful, until the very last five minutes, where there is a game of mirrors, that I am yet to understand, which creates a brilliant shot. This is also followed by the last plan of the film, which fits perfectly with the black and white, and ends the movie in a beautiful style. The music is very good, with some very interesting choice of tracks, apart from in the opening scene where the jazz tune is, in my opinion, out of sync with the camera work. Saving the most important for last, the black and white. Does it make sense? Yes, I believe the black and white is used to emphasize the two characters, the two personalities, that argue throughout the movie and reveal themselves to us, and that is in fact a very good idea and something that I enjoyed. In spite of this, it's so badly done. When you watch movies like ""Roma"" or ""Cold War"" you marvel at their black and white, it's truly beautiful. But in ""Malcolm & Marie"" it just disappointing. It's empty and brings no impact to the movie. Once again, it seemed to me that it was just another pretentious move by Sam Levinton.All things considered, it was an average movie, a bold and very challenging concept from Sam Levinton that could have been a cinema milestone, but in the end, it does not surpass mediocracy.","6","diogobulhosa"," We get it Sam Levinton, you can name a lot of Directors.

Similar to, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" the action happens in one place, centers on a couple and zeros in on their insecurities. Only people deeply involved and intertwined are able to home in so devastatingly. The film is carried deftly by actors, John David Washington and Zendaya. The material is sophisticated and raw and the dialog delivered is perfect pitch. The contemporary house is the perfect setting for this story. I love the high note and energy of the first scene and watching Washington dance to James Brown. Zendaya is more than a pretty face, as an actor she is a force to be reckoned with. They both are!

"1160","I was excited for this movie -- I think we all were. I have loved Zendaya since I was a kid, and even more so in the last couple years as she's made her transition into more mature roles. John David Washington showed real promise in BlacKkKlansman, and I think he is well on his way to making a lasting impression in Hollywood beyond his father's. Sam Levinson has proven himself to be an excellent writer and creative presence with HBO's Euphoria, especially in the most recent bridge episodes.Malcolm & Marie had everything going for it, so what the hell went wrong?I'll preface by saying that the acting and cinematography are the film's strongest elements. People can say whatever they want about the age difference between the two leads (even though there have been much larger ones in other movies, and Zendaya is a full-grown adult), but it's very clear that they both gave their all to the material. Black-and-white aesthetics are my kryptonite when it comes to film, and the intimate setting of Malcolm & Marie allows for that choice to feel warranted. It's eye candy in every sense of the phrase.Malcolm & Marie's issues lie mainly in its script. The emphasis on monologues was definitely necessary to drive the plot forward but unfortunately, they're not always effective. A story this contained should rely heavily on its writing, yet there are too many moments when what the characters are saying feels pre-packaged. I could've lived with the two people the film follows being unlikeable and graining if the screenplay did a better job at making the audience care about them. This script was written in less than two weeks, and it shows.I wanted to love this movie. I was even ready for it to snag a couple Oscar nominations. But this ain't it. It'll be forgotten about, because sadly, too many other movies have done a story like this better (see Richard Linklater's ""Before"" trilogy). The worst part is, this is one of those films that believes it's greater than it really is -- it's the kind of pretentiousness that you can feel as you're watching. I had high hopes for Malcom & Marie, and while it has its moments, they are few and far between.Because this movie was so divided among critics, I suggest that you watch it if you're interested and form your own opinion.

"1164","I am a tv and film major who is not at all easily impressed. The script was excellent...performances....Amazing!. I do not think that many people will appreciate a movie like this due to its appearance of simplicity. But this film was both simple and complex at the same time. It's all about the ""Why"" with this movie. Zendaya (who i feel is a very very underrated actress) delivers a top notch performance. She shows her true versatility as an actress. Meanwhile JDW is really coming into his own (although at times if you close your eyes you hear his Dad's voice, he seems to be the next up and coming actor). At times it is crazy, calm, loving, hateful, vindictive, spiteful and more. But, it does a great job of connecting the complexities or relationships, appreciation and communication. I hope this film receives the recognition it deserves...because it deserves the recognition.","8","mrdferguson-35024"," Should be award winning!

Levinson does a great job unveiling this human emotions for everyone to see. Watch this movie with someone you love, and I guarantee you so many moments will resonate with you both individually and as a couple.","9","anconlon"," Full of depth and truth

But it didn't happen, on the contrary, I felt as if the story was unfolding within the space around me. It was so real and present for the way we as audience could dig into the souls and emotions of the two main characters.I do believe that Zendaya is one of the best contemporary actresses, but nine star out of ten because I felt she was too young for the role. Don't get me wrong, knowing that she was there was one of the main reasons I wanted to watch this movie, but it took me a while to accept her character and really enjoy the narrative.It was a rollercoaster of emotions and pain, pain that I felt mostly for Marie than for Malcolm.

"1174","Malcolm and Marie is absolutely brilliant. I think many people aren't accustomed to this type of an intelligent film written for Black people with Black actors especially today. Don't @ me because I SAID WHAT I SAID. Were used to lowbrau, predictable nonsense that doesn't challenge the acting chops of the subjects. This is an extremely grueling film of a couple that rips each other apart emotionally like so many of us. These two don't like each other, even though they think they're madly in love. They're just mad. Foaming at the mouth mad.The cold, exacting bitterness the draws blood almost every time they look at each other out of bed harkins back to Liz Taylor and Richard Burton in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966). More recent, Clive Owen and Julia Roberts in Closer.Malcolm thinks he's in love with someone who has not learned to love herself because of her past. At the same time, he only loves her when she's adoring him. Then she loathes him because she doesn't believe he sees her.The two are emotionally unhealthy carnage co-dependent on each other. Mutual destruction is assured but they are that dysfunctional couple that will probably stay together 10 more years nonetheless making each other miserable.The acting is mesmerizingif only because many of us recognize ourselves in the two of them. For people who appreciate excellent film with superb acting, this is a MUST see. Zendaya is incredible. She is a grown woman and she acts like one in this film. John Washington is always delicious to watch but his acting is certainly closing in on his father.","10","blaxblew"," Malcolm and Marie is a Brilliant Adult Film

"1177","Netflix announced ONE big movie for every month of 2021. In January we had The Sit, an informational, beautiful and peaceful movie, but in February the big movie is Malcom & Marie, which felt actually pretty big. Even the title itself reminds us of the tragical classic couples like Romeo & Juliet, Tristan & Isolde, anticipating a powerful conflict. It felt nice to see Zendaya actually playing a role which matches her acting standard, and I believed her, she truly deserves more serious role from now on. John David Washington's performance is a delight to watch and his strangely chaotic stile of acting really catches you. The fact that is filmed black-white amplifies the conflict and keep it there. I couldn't get enough of the protagonists' sharp lines and the knife scene is G O L D, not going to say more. I absolutely adored the outstanding Malcom & Marie and I feel the obligation to recommend it even if to some people may seem either boring, too noisy and exhausting.","8","AndrewFNU"," Raw, Loud and Extremely Accurate

"1180","The performances truly made this movie, there was not a moment that I felt Zendaya and John were lacking. The cinematography was good but it is noticeable that the physical restrictions is what formed it. They use wide shots and have the characters make up for the lack of cuts with their movement around the space. The house is supposed to be huge, but I didn't feel that it was - which Sam wanted so that's a good point. The script could only be taken so far, it was lame. There are definitely moments where the characters dig into each other's weaknesses but I don't feel the pain, I don't feel the soul-crushing words. the performances are heartbreaking but the words aren't. I don't know if I should go easier on the filmmaker because of the restrictions or if I should just treated this as any movie. There was hype around this movie and it came off as dull.another thing: the choice of black and white with black characters would have truly showed the lack of effort placed on lighting dark skin but the lighting in this movie was not breathtaking. it was very sharp at some points for a plot that was showcasing emotional complexities and other times it was very monotoned and dull. I changed by brightness as some points just to see if it was me that wasn't viewing it properly","7","nishamilk"," Here's my criticism that the movie criticized
"
"1181","This movie is phenomenal and if anyone says otherwise, it's because they're lying to themselves and still think relationships are sunshines and rainbows. This movie captures what it's like to be REALLY in love past the honey moon stage. It's raw; it's not a dipiction of some false reality of love. It doesn't portray toxicity like some of the reviews I've seen claims. It portrays two people who understand DEPTH, whilst one (Marie) actually understand their own trauma. Toxic would look like two people projecting their mental issues, past traumaS, and emotional baggage all day long. However, this is RAW In that the sense that two people are trying to rack through the mist and muck of their emotions, with logic nonetheless. If you're one who understands their own psychology, whilst understands their partner's, while all the while remaining grounded, you'll understand this movie fully. But if all you know of is booty calls, ""situationships"" , and trauma bonding, the message goes right over your head. Poor souls.","10","julissajay-48887"," If you lack depth.. you won't get it.

"1182","I saw a comment on Youtube that said: ""This movie is the feature length adaptation of that Marriage Story fight scene, shot line an Calvin Klein ad.""This quote says nearly everything what needs to be said about the film. First of all: John David Washington and Zendaya are OUTSTANDINGLY GOOD. Both deliver a very powerful and emotional performance. At some points the cinematography is also very captivating, and some of the dialogue in combination with the smooth jazz in the backround keeps you interested. That's it. You feel throughout that Malcolm isn't talking to Marie about reviews, it's Sam Levinson who talks to us. I think he's very insecure with his own work and wanted to let off some steam in this one, after getting a horrible review from the LA Times about one of his other films. He wraps this up in minute-long monologues of JDW talking about black filmmakers and on and on and on...I quickly lost interest.Due to (at some points) good directing and cinematography, and the smooth songs, still a solid 6/10.","6","Done1517"," One word: LEVINSON
"
"1183","The movie is a character study of a guy who made a movie about drug abuse and a girl who is a drug abuse survivor. The movie is in greyscale which is aesthetically pleasing and can be symbolised as figuring out a grey-thin-line of comfort in this love-hate relationship. They were failing and trying to have sex throughout which can be symbolised as them trying to know the other better or just getting under each other's skin to inflict more harm. Malcolm is scared of being called a ""mediocre director"". He also has limited self-awareness to the point he crucifies anyone who talks against his work or himself. Marie is extremely self-sabotaging and unable to share her feelings without passive-aggression.There are some good pointers discussed (don't quote)
1. Just because I'm a black man doesn't mean everything I make is political or about race.2. How indifferent/similar an artist can be to their art? (Marie says she toils with both his directional edits and him as a boyfriend for the same reasons)3. How a perspective defines one's reality? (Malcolm says you want control because you can't understand why I'm with you. The reason is I love you.)4. Is an apology enough to regain trust? (Marie always feels Malcolm takes her for granted. He, in fact, didn't give her the credits she truly deserves, but he apologised for it a million times)5. You need to appreciate yourself.
(Marie has a monologue in which she reminiscents the acts she has done for Malcolm. It can look as selfishly counting one's worth, but it was curing for Marie because she struggles with self-esteem)The whole movie was them projecting their insecurities and verbally abusing each other. Malcolm was worse than Marie in this case. This talking in circles is what I believe was the red flag. They are incapable of having a conversation without being hurtful. But since they truly in love (debatable), they are not addressing their incompatibility. It doesn't give you a second to breathe before bringing another session of screaming, swearing and tearing the other down. And this is not how normal relationships should be, there can be disagreement but not this level of abuse. Don't watch this movie if you're in a toxic relationship or trying to wind down. I was exhausted because it was incredibly overwhelming.","6","Senryu-Cherry"," In a sick relationship, couple's block every red flag.

"1184","I am truly captivated by this movie. At first I wasn't so sure about it, but the formula is something... fresh for me. I never thought that movie with two actors would be so good. I only had a occasion to see John David Washington in this film and in ""Tenet"" and in both roles he did great (but I love this scene when he went outside and talked to himself and monologue about critics), but Zendaya... oh, I fell in love with Marie. Even after ""Euphoria"" I didn't see her as ""adult"" actor like she said herself but after this... damn, she got me.","8","mindfullofdreams"," Magnetizing
"
"1185","I'll be honest this film was very difficult to watch for me, but it was cathartic, and I think it made me love it even more.
When they started the film with the credits I knew I was in for a treat.
I forgot who said this but I saw someone say that Malcolm & Marie is not a love story but instead a story about love. That seems so simple but it's so so true. Who thought that perspective would make a romance like this so profound. Because this film is profound. All we have are two people, two people in a relationship, who love each other tear each other apart, put each other back together again and then continue this cycle all in the course of one night. I'll compare it to Marriage Story in that there is no bias on either counterpart, there are times you side with Malcolm and there are time where you side with Marie. That's the key to a great romance especially when you are showing a love affair with cracks beginning to show.
The fact both of these characters are artists in their own right makes emotions even stronger because as an artists you feel things in varying levels. Sometimes more strongly sometimes less so, sometimes your art will tie you together and connect you like nothing else but it can just as easily break you. In this context it adds another layer to a complex relationship and that's why for me it just struck a core more so than anything I've seen for a very very long time. Therefore I may be biased towards this film however you can't lie it captures love in a raw and unfiltered way that hurts like a knife to the heart but you would never want to be without it.
Technically this film is a flourish of effective understatement, with the bold use of black and white and strongly framed shots. The script is just insane and although music isn't used much and it's played within the world of the film instead of underscoring the action it fits so well. Also it would be criminal of me to not mention just how amazing Zendaya and John David Washington are. Neither of them outshine each other, they light each other up on screen and leave everything on the floor. Landmark performances from them both.
From first glance people don't seem to be liking this film as much as I am, however I do think it's that kind of film, take it how you want but you'll experience both beauty and pain and that's a killer combo.","10","sfworthington"," Love & Art

Black and white makes the people stand out and their performances are great (they are also both stunningly beautiful). The whole movie is basically one big fight, so normal and so exaggerated at the same time, with all the breaks, the pauses, the deep cuts a normal fight between two people in love would have. It makes you feel and remember emotions from your life even if your background is not similar to theirs, you will feel them.Overall, it's a nice work, its different than most movies out there and this is what it makes it stand out. Zendaya and John David Washington are so great without being too much, they make it feel like an everyday couple having a fight.7/10 because the couple is great and it all feels natural and real.","7","nakisnakis"," Surprisingly captivating

Even though they seemed like to have solved the situation at first, the argument starts up again out of no where. The arguments are emotional and seems realistic. And the movie is a great character study. But the way the arguments start are ridiculous. The movie seems like a boxing match except with arguments.

Thank you to mac and cheese. You held the opening together through a series of quick cuts. Thank you to beautiful, modernist houses in the middle of nowhere - not only do you allow cast and crews to isolate during a global pandemic but you hold yourself apart from your surroundings so that we all must say ""Who the hell lives here?"" and ""I would not feel comfortable having sex in a lit room at night with all those windows."" Thank you to Zendaya's costume designer - you had a beautiful woman and you made sure we knew it. Thank you to JDW's tux - if 2020 thought us anything, it is that that man looks good in a suit. Thank you to all night arguments - we hate you at the time but we reach a better understanding because of you. At least if you haven't had too much to drink, which Zendaya had not because she is getting clean. (JDW had no shame knocking back a few though, right guys?) Thank you to cigarettes and their power to make us look cool. Thank you to strategically placed oven lighters 'cause they help us get the shot without worrying about the vagaries of matchsticks. Thank you to that lady from the LA Times who must be wondering what Sam Levinson has against her. Unless she knows - then she must be thinking ""Wow. Public way to take revenge much?"" but she gonna have hella fun writing her review of this one (I really gotta go look that up.) Thank you to star power and the perception that two people arguing all night will be more interesting if it's two gorgeous stars. (You are correct.) Thank you to the unfortunate choice to weight the movie towards Marie's side of the argument so we're never really in doubt whose side we're meant to be on, leaving JDW with a lot of ground to make up which he can never really do because his arguments are fairly ridiculous. Thank you to the act of shouting which JDW did a lot of, and it was a bold choice but it was the wrong one. Hey, live and learn. Thank you to black and white photography - hoo boy a girl can look good in black and white. Thank you to the bath tub. I would like a free standing bath tub like that. Thank you to film premieres; I have rarely been to one but I know now they are hot beds of intrigue and skullduggery. Thank you to Tana - why DID you say that thing? That was weird. Thank you to nail scissors; you're blunt and we're better for it. Thank you to John Cassavetes; you can't be beat, man. Thank you to covid-19; Sam and 'Daya woulda been making Euphoria right about now if it weren't for you so I guess we have you to thank for this. Thank you to emotional honesty, 'cause when a woman lets a man know that he has taken and taken and taken from her, and he has not not repaid her in kind, he needs to listen or he will find himself alone in the morning and not 'cause his girl is making more mac and cheese.

"1202","Likening filmmaker-critics relationship to marriage is probably the most simple thing this film has ever pointed out. Everything else is quite complicated. Emotional volatility, if you will, when it comes to handling the emotion of another human being, given any commendation and especially deprecation of someone's cinematic ""baby"" never gets any easier to accept, some things said would inevitably bug someone out. And it works both ways, so being thin-skinned is never really an option in both side of tinseltown. So Sam Levinson's exploration of the subject whether or not born out of his real-life experience doesn't really matter. It is what it is, and he has done exceptionally well in making a glorified rant out of it. Tolerability of watching such indulgence is what matters, which he has exquisitely pulled off in utilizing the talents of high caliber like Washington and Zendaya as the titular characters. One could also say it to be quite Bergman-esque. Or an unapologetic Swedish master derivative that is Woody Allen as well during his peak in some parts. The choice of showcasing his story in B&W added a heightened charm for Levinson's work which makes it only accessible to those with tolerance for such artistic eccentricities. And the music/soundtrack is top-freaking-notch.

"1204","Malcolm & Marie, Sam Levinson's uncharacteristic foray into straightforward drama, depicts an evolving argument inside of a one-act play structure. Unlike the hopeless ""cry-in-my-beer"" commiseration of the fruitless Ma Rainey's Black Bottom or the circular complaint session of One Night in Miami..., the central conflicts of Malcolm & Marie explore the deficiencies of the characters rather than the deficiencies of some scapegoat system.In avoiding rehashing cliched complaints, the arguments of Malcolm & Marie aren't just tedious arguments. They actually take the characters (and the audience) to different places all of which are real from tensions of complex relationships/people to strikingly honest reflections of phony Hollywood progressivism on race (the line: ""she thinks she's doing a public service by lifting up your mediocre a--"" describes Hollywood's diversity push among critics, celebrities and Twitter today).However, the structure of Malcolm & Marie requires its viewership to commit to its argumentative journey and take on its observations. Otherwise, it's just a tedious argument between two bitterly insecure and malformed people. Consequentially, Malcolm & Marie is designed for a limited audience. Fit with exquisite cinematography, Malcolm & Marie will either emerge as noisy lovers quarrel or an expectation-busting excursion into the personal, political and social stresses of a couple in the modern commercial artistic sphere. For me, I expected the former, and was pleasantly surprised to get the latter.","7","teriekwilliams-48053"," The Point of Conversation

"1209","This is so frustrating because this film looked very promising. Maybe I went in expecting it to be good but I was ultimately disappointed. First off, John David Washington and Zendaya do an excellent job. I believed that they were portraying these characters and they really bring out their emotional moments in a powerful way. If there is anything to take away from this film, it's the excellent performances. However, their respective characters feel very underdeveloped. Washington's character has little to no characterization while Zendaya's has some but not enough characterization. We get an interesting backstory but that's about it. The script also hampers their performances just a little bit with how basic it is. The messages the film sends are very surface level and don't leave a lot of room for interpretation. One of the messages regards white critics praising films by a black director in a political sense. While I do agree, that's as deep as it gets. This idea isn't explored more and it honestly makes the film feel like a hitpiece against critics. This film did not need to be in black and white. I've honestly tried thinking for a reason behind why the film is in black and white and I can't find one. It makes the film feel very pretentious. I did like how the film was shot though as some of the cinematography is gorgeous and I liked the song choices. If you enjoy Sam Levinson's work or these two actors then you'll probably enjoy this more than I did.","5","theredsky"," Malcolm & Marie Review

"1212","I am a film student at the Univeraity of Pretoria in South Africa. A friend of mine asked me to watch Sam Levinson's film Malcolm & Marie, to provide her with some depth to understand the film as she couldn't make sense of it. This review is strictly my own opinion.The use of black & white and one location places emphasis on the characters and their emotions. The isolation of the characters from the outside world makes it very intimate, private and timeless. This makes the viewer feel like an intruder, but also demands the viewers attention throughout the film.The modern fancy lifestyle portrayed is the ""mask"" they wear in public, how they want the world to see them. The ""American dream"" however there is some disturbing emtional depth to these characters.
Marie and Malcolm portrays each others inner demons.As they talk to each other the viewers get to know each character so well that it becomes uncomfortable to watch because we all have demons to fight within ourselves and this is exactly what both characters are going through. It is as though Malcolm is Marie's subconcious and Marie is Malcolm's subconcious because they talk about each other's insecurities, fears and weaknessess on such a personal level that it almost seems like something they would tell themselves, one could call it the ""dark side"" of each character.The repetition of the fighting portrays the endless fight we have with ourselves as we go through life, physically and psychologically.The topic of conversation is not as important in this film as the things they say to each other but it does bring about a lot of insecurities in both characters as if it triggers their emotions.During the long pauses between fights they begin to face their own truths, then only true love become evident between and within both charactersThis film was made in the early stages of the COVID pandemic. A time where we were all isolated, a time where I myself had conversations about how much self reflection this year had forced me to do.The characters made it through this timeless evening of inner and outer conflict, facing their own truths and finding ways to love each other regardless of the circumstances. It may be argued that it is about true love, but maybe we need to crytically self reflect in order to truely love ourselves in the deepest of our forms.","7","nicoleneolivier"," Crytical eyes find deeper meanings

"1214","This movie is just exhausting and it drags itself for 1 hour and 45 minutes in which the only likeable things are the decent cinematography and the soundtrack.
1 hour and 45 minutes of forced, unnatural and extremely pretentious dialogs; of poses too staged to feel authentic; of end-to-end situations that often get so exaggerated they almost get to the point to be grotesque; of mirrors put in specific places so that the director could make that totally unnecessary but so strongly aesthetic shot.
A movie, so arrogant not naive, that constantly thinks, that it's sure to be smarter, better and more important than it actually is.

"1216","Malcolm and Marie is more of an artsy somewhat pretentious movie in the fact that there is not really much going on. The movie takes place over one night and only features two characters. Many would argue that there wasn't a plot, but there are many films that have won awards without even having a plot. The point of this movie is to relate and understand these two characters. Personally i believe that some people are not as invested in the movie and thats why this movie is getting some bad reviews, but that's ok because everyone is different. Just know before watching this movie that you really shouldn't expect any big explosions, sex scenes, or big plot twists. This movie is just a simple little story.","10","dacbelcher"," Great movie, but not for everyone.
"
"1217","That is why I rate it a 6/10.
Starting with the screenplay, the dialogue between the two characters sounds a little off and over the top. It doesn't feel real and it just sound flat because the movie tries to come across as 'artsy' so they don't really say anything true or meaningful. The movie starts with a fight between the couple and ends with a fight and in between these 2 fights, you guessed it there's more fights. By repeating it self over and over the movie becomes a little boring.
If you have seen the movie there's one scene where Malcolm starts talking about a review and it just goes on and on and it just looks like Sam Levinson has some hate bottled against some critics so this scene is kinda weird and doesn't particularly fit.
All in all the acting was great and the moments where Marie isn't talking her face says it all and its there where Zandaya truly shines. John also shows his immense talent and delivers a fine performance.","6","luis151"," Great acting and great cinematography

"1218","In relationships, do not be afraid, apprehensive, shy, reluctant, when it comes to saying ""I'm sorry, you mean so much to me."" I do believe there are subtle nuisances behind apologizing and saying I am sorry. You can be 'sorry' but not apologetic. This film displays the variation between the two. One is lined in sensitivity, empathy, the other is a projection of our defense mechanisms & pride. This movie ask challenging questions about self-worth and how do you define something abstract like 'love'? Why would you ever want someone you 'love' to feel like bad? Why argue to be 'right,' so vehemently, that you make the person you 'love' feel weak,dumb, inferior, conflating facts to make a bad point? I suppose we can all be a bit of #MalcolmandMarie Two people going back and forth can be suspenseful as hell! The cinematography, the acting, the authenticity! Dope, emotional movie!

"1219","Years ago, Moonlight won the Academy's Best Motion Picture. To this day I struggle to understand why. Nevertheless, Malcolm & Marie could sweep a few Oscar categories and I'd fully understand it without effort.Those who refer to this film as being just an hour long argument are simply lost amidst the brilliance of its cinematic parlance. Malcolm & Marie is a viable study of the human condition with such genuine ferocity that it can be complicated to digest if one comes to this film with preconceived notions.I would venture a guess that there isn't a relationship of any kind, lasting more than one full year, that hasn't digressed at some point into something that resembles the tumult and pain of Malcolm & Marie-if even only for a fleeting moment. There is a realness and familiarity to these characters. We've seen them in ourselves. Perhaps in our parents. Our in-laws or other relatives.This film is often uncomfortable to watch. It slaps us with pain, empathy and raw emotion. And despite that reality, it is hard to put down.The nearly monochromatic grayscale approach serves to focus the viewer quite myopically on the two characters that dominate the screen. The choice is obvious yet subtly self-serving. A prism devoid of color. A reticle into their life. Not relying solely on the impeccable script, the adept recitation of its every emotion and monologues by Washington and Zendaya, Levinson thrusts the chaotic and strained dynamic between the characters into the faces and psyches of the viewer.Both characters are fractured in ways that are irreparable, inseparable and inconceivable. We feel their pain. We live their antagonism. We struggle with them to come out of the endless loop of loved-laced lunacy that permeates their reality. This is a film that makes those in the room constantly glance at one another in complete dismay and accordance.I've talked about this film abstractly so as not to produce spoilers, but rather to entice those on the fence to watch it and really open themselves to its cold, disturbing embrace. Yes, some professional critics are panning this film as exhaustive and laughable. Truth be told, those are the very critics whose review work I find to be both.There is nothing laughable about this film. But it's impact can prove exhausting. Because it strikes the heart with a massive thump that takes one's breath away.This is a genius piece of filmmaking. There is something new, fresh and remarkably approachable about this movie. It's chock full of complex monologues. It embodies dizzying shifts in temperament and tone and culminates in a triumphant climax that makes you want to turn off the TV and just contemplate it out of reverence.Bravo! That was worth every second. Especially the two Oscar worthy performances.","10","pharaohseye"," Stunning, eclectic, moving and inherently insightful.

"1220","Like the free jazz of John Coltrane, Miles Davis, or Sun Ra, Malcolm & Marie is a film that runs free and refuses to be constrained or easily defined, almost beckoning you to attempt to understand it, but never offering a safety net or a definitive answer for its own ponderings. It is elusive and difficult to penetrate despite its rather straightforward set up of a couple, debating amongst themselves and each other on if their relationship is truly fruitful or sustainable, almost like a stage play in its approach.It is a film that has been labeled as 'pretentious,' which is certainly understandable, some of its dialogues often go on and on, talking about topics in a way that some might find to feel wanting or desperate to sound profound or meaningful. But I never felt the condescension and self importance of The Matrix or the more egregious self-aggrandizement that Lars von Trier is capable of, attempting to convince everyone how 'deep' and meaningful he is, Malcolm & Marie felt more genuine in its approach in its ponderings. It caused me to go through conflicting feelings while watching it, I laughed (rather it be by design or not), I was shocked, I was confused, and even caught off guard emotionally. Many of the arguments and raw emotion that's touched upon in Malcolm & Marie gave me some uncomfortable flashbacks to arguments that I've had with people in my life, ones that veered into more personal matters and got extremely uncomfortable. But, if I were asked what I think of the film, I can't really say that I know what to make of it, to be certain.What I can say for certain however is that John David Washigton and Zendaya are both excellent, I must say that I've been impressed with Zendaya's change through the last couple of years, as most Disney alumni of her ilk tend to either burn out (often in dramatic fashion) or fade away into obscurity, but she's an exception to the rule, and one that I've been glad to see. She is mesmerizing in the role, carrying a bitterness and a sardonic wit, while also not afraid to let out her emotional vulnerabilities. Washington's performance is also fantastic, he speaks with the eloquence and grace, as well as the intensity that is clearly from his father, the great Denzel Washington, but also captures a physical versatility as well, which is very unlike Denzel's more reticent, cautious style of acting. I wonder if Malcolm is meant to have autism, considering that I myself have the disorder and noticed several tendencies, such as his lack of awareness for social cues, an insensitivity to others feelings, and often acting out in strange ways, such as punching and kicking around when alone and ranting to himself, though perhaps that was something that director Sam Levinson may not have even intended. Washington and Zendaya play well off of each other throughout the film's runtime, often challenging one another to see which one will break first, to see who will outclass the other. Another thing that can be praised for certain is the film's impeccable sense of design, with its evocative cinematography and score, mostly consisting of old classics from James Brown, Duke Ellington, and the aforementioned John Coltrane.The film is certainly flawed in several ways, with the film basically being a series of long monologues, it can feel tedious at points. It was quite disappointing at times when I caught myself becoming distracted with something else. It's not to say that a film of this type can't be done well, as films like 12 Angry Men, Locke, and Glengarry Glen Ross have shown full well that it's possible to have a film basically be a bunch of conversations and still be riveting from beginning to end, even Shakespeare had the remarkable ability of using language in a way where it made mundane conversations feel powerful, unique, and even inspiring. Sam Levinson is not always such a man, while he can craft scenes that are powerful and emotionally challenging, he can just as well veer off into diatribes that make him feel wanting, as if he's trying too hard to be profound and unique. While I did say that Malcolm & Marie is better with its more ponderous nature, that doesn't mean that its flaws can be excused or that it can fall into the traps of other films like it.Malcolm & Marie is a film that's often oscillating between tones, themes, character motivation, and so on. It was occasionally sad, occasionally funny, occasionally joyous, occasionally tragic. It is a film that is often elusive, leaving you more befuddled and curious than you were when you first began to watch it, giving no safety nets for the audience and only giving you. All you're given is the characters, as they are, sometimes saying one thing, while their actions suggest another. I often questioned to myself about what this film was even about, and if I truly 'got it.' If you asked me, it was about two broken people, whose lives are lost for two very different reasons, rather it be from insecurity, addiction, emotional turmoil, and so on. It's about two people who are both toxic to each other, but are also meant for each other in their own unusual way. It's a romance, one that's doomed to fail eventually, and then eventually getting up for the next day is just a statement to their denial of the situation that they're in and an indication that they've learned nothing from their previous experiences, and the cycle continues on.In the end, It's one of those movies where I'm unsure if I liked it, hated it, or just thought that it was ok. But I do know that it had me thinking and I won't be forgetting about it anytime soon.","7","someokiedude"," Free Jazz, as a Movie.

"1226","So that would explain why the critic reviews were so low..Malcolm and Marie is so beautifully shot. I love the black and white and the grain of the film. The jazzy score also serves the story greatly. John David Washington and Zendaya kill it - that scene were Zendaya had the knife made my jaw drop. That's how you subvert expectations. The film teaches about the importance of showing gratefulness in a relationship and being appreciative for the small things your partner does for you which, personally, is something I need to be reminded of often. Some people just assume your partner knows your appreciative, but some people want you to tell/show them. I really appreciate the film for spreading that message.However, the film is not without its flaws. Because the movie is very much dialogue-driven, it can a bit exhausting at times. My bigger problem with the film, though, is the lack of nuance and subtlety it carried with the multiple anti-critic monologues. The first one, I didn't mind, but the second one lasts about ten minutes, and it may have been better off if Sam Levinson just walked on set and gave a spoken word. The whole message just does not work within this film and felt so fourth-wall breaking. It doesn't ruin the movie for me, but It definitely took me out and, unfortunately, holds the film back from being much greater than it could've been.Still, I absolutely love the visuals, score, and cinematography of this film. I'd love to see more of these low-budget, small set, limited cast movies that are heavily focused on characters and relationship over big budget spectacle. I love the indie style of this movie and how it was shot during lockdown. Does it compare to Marriage Story? Not even close. Should the critic sub-plot have been left out and just further developed the relationship between Malcolm and Marie? Yeah. But this is the film we got, and it was still a delight to watch.Rating: 8/10","7","elwynchofmann"," Pretentious? Yeah. Still Good? Yeah

"1228","Sincerely ""Malcolm and Marie"" was a film that I waited for a while with longing and good expectations, as I longed to see John David Washington and Zendaya together in a film.
I liked very much the direction that this film had, with plane-sequences that gave nature to the interpretations. Another good point to note is that the performances of both actors have enchanted me, John David Washington and Zendaya are the best of the film and somehow ""save"" it and make it better than it could have been without these two actors.
but unfortunately the film did not convince me completely, because, (although it has a good format to tell the story) I only enjoyed approximately the first 50 minutes of the movie (in which I really had a great time and did not take an eye off the TV), but the rest of the film was somewhat boring, had unnecessary and irrelevant dialogues which could have been better, certainly this was what made me give this rating to ""Malcolm and Marie"" and not a higher one, which I wish I had done.","7","lucascoluccioinostroza"," 50 minutes

"1235","Malcolm & Marie is about Malcolm and Marie. That much I'm certain of. It's a statement I can safely put forth without fearing that I'm making assumptions about the identity of the film's creator, or their intent in creating it.For a film that can so easily be summarized as ""Malcolm and Marie come home, they talk, and they fight"", this picture has a remarkable amount of stirring commentary on the modern film industry and the adjacent world of criticism (not as sagacious as Pixar's Ratatouille, but it'll do). Had I been a more stereotypical critic, I might have asserted that Sam Levinson is using these black characters as a convenient mouthpiece to speak out against the identity politics that suggest a director's racial/sexual/gender attributes meaningfully matter when their work is to be assessed.""Why would real blxck people (sic) ever say this about The Movement? Surely they realize that it's for their sake that I, the white girl from the LA Times, care about black identitarianism and believe even rich movie-makers to be less 'privileged' than me, all due to race?""Maybe we'd be proving his point if we were to type things like that, or at least those espoused by Malcolm Elliott (John David Washington), a neophyte movie director and husband to failed actress Marie Jones (Zendaya). Maybe we ought to ask, as Malcolm rantingly suggests, whether the ideas themselves are valid, or (ironically) if we should even fuss over what The Message might be - let us focus on the filmmaking choices, which needn't be related to who Levinson is or where he came from. Then again, as Marie rebuts (when breaking free from her silent numbness), there is something to be said of authenticity; basing your young, marginalized characters on people who truly know the experience.This is one of the many reasons why HBO's Euphoria (also created by Levinson) was so good; Hunter Schafer, for one, was heavily involved in the writing of the Jules Vaughn character. Whether a piece of cinema is really meant to be about the authenticity in how the characters and topics are portrayed, or the imagination in how it is handled, Malcolm & Marie does well in both ways.Me, I happen to be a fan of clever presentation. I love, for example, a movie where the actors channel a myriad of emotions throughout even the lengthiest takes (all of them beautifully lit and moodily colorless), helping the conversations (i.e. at least 85% of the runtime) remain both interesting and escalatingly tense.Levinson is scarily skilled at keeping us ensnared in scenes of pure talk. Watching the Euphoria Christmas special, I felt as if I could watch an entire movie presented in this manner - think My Dinner with Andre but on the opposite end of the classiness spectrum.With Malcolm & Marie, that's not too far from what I got. The problem with this, I now realize, is that it feels like something's missing. Malcolm & Marie is an example of ""tell-don't-show"" done right. It's just that I might have loved it even more if it was the season finale of a TV series that, y'know, showed stuff.Indeed, some viewers may not buy the characterizations as seen here; how the two leads move from hatred to affection to more hatred, then bonding during scenes that are pretty much squarely devoted to commentary - the screenplay mostly mixes its film-industry critique with the character- and relationship development quite efficiently (Marie feels deeply hurt by some of Malcolm's decisions in adapting ""her"" story to the big screen) but some of it is just ranting. There's quite a bit of messaging in this movie about how movies don't always need to have a message.And even though I am arguably a critic, albeit still a hobbyist with only the occasional guest publication under my belt, I understand the sentiment. The world of criticism has become an ocean of interchangeable, often snooty, sometimes excessively ""academic"" essays since we lost Ebert. It's hip and cool to discuss identity politics and there may be points to make about Levinson. Me, I'm happy to simply inform you that the movie's good but Euphoria is better.","7","TheVictoriousV"," The message is that there isn't always a message

"1238","This is one of the few films that managed to be filmed during the pandemic and Netflix have now released Malcolm & Marie and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a director and his girlfriend question everything when they return from the premier of his new film.Main Characters
Usually I would split the acting into two categories but considering there are literally only two people in this film it seems logical to just put them both in this section. John David Washington plays Malcolm & Zendaya plays Marie and they are both fantastic here. They literally have to carry this film on their backs and they do it superbly well, they deliver monologues that just keep going and feel like they are very real to them and the story that the characters were going through. When the nominations for the Oscars come out I would be stunned if both of these two aren't nominated for two really, really strong performances that should be seen and appreciated.Story
The story is interesting, it basically is set in one location and sees a night in these two peoples lives and how their relationship basically unravels and come to a head. The strength is in the performances and the way that they get you to grapple onto their characters and the turmoil more then the actual strength of the plot. There are elements that work, but at times at least for me it felt like we were going in circles and were padding for time and I actually think this film could have been more effective with less if that makes sense.Script
The dialogue is well written and it feels very raw and emotional, heck it makes you question if these two should even be together and which one of them is the worst. It allows both Washington & Zendaya to have effective moments and big acting scenes. But I will say this does feel a bit one dimensional, it feels like Washington will have a monologue, then Zendaya will and then rinse and repeat with very little in breaking up the structure.Style
The film is presented in Black & White and I am not exactly sure the reason for this but it was effective to say the least, it just made the film stand out and feel a bit more unique. But this film was too long for me, as I mentioned above I think this film would have been way more effective if it was at least 15mins shorter and really had no filler and hit the queues that it needed.Overall
Overall, this is a good movie that is really well acted. I will say that this is a film that will divide opinion but I think if you want to see a film with really strong acting and intensity then Malcolm and Marie is a decent shout.","7","alindsay-al"," A Good Film With Fantastic Acting

"1241","***Spoiler alert!!First, i do want to say that the movie was shot beautifully and i really liked Zandaya as she was really engaging and funny and entertaining. But JDW was just odd in this movie, myself and my gf gave it 45mins, but she couldn't handle it anymore. We get the story, we get the acting, but it was really toxic and for people not in these types of relationships it can be extremely negative and boring. I do like JDW also, but he was a emotional terrorist in this movie and how can you forget to ""thank"" your spouse in a movie that was somewhat based off her?!?! But you happened to thank literally everyone else and even the dog, etc lol... Either way, to each their own, we were expecting more since it was labelled a ""Thriller"" But I'm sorry this is NOT a Thriller type movie. I would just say romance, suspense that's it. I wanted to like it but i only give it a 6/10. And yes, it should've been much shorter like others have stated.","5","wewaj-03329"," I agree with others on both sides of being good/bad

"1242","A director and his girlfriend's relationship is tested after they return home from his movie premiere and await critics' responses. (Via IMDB)First, the film isn't dull, it's just full of dialogues and conversations which makes it seem like it's a boring/dull film. But, the dialogues were so genuine/deep (sometimes) and of course Zendaya and John David Washington made them 10 times better. I think without them, the film would've been DEAD. Now John David Washington's performance was good. But, wouldn't say that it's his best one. His performance in ""Tenet"" (2020) and in ""Blackkklansman"" (2018) was better. In some scenes, I felt like he was just trying so hard to look great and to show everyone that he can fit any role. But, Zendaya's performance was the best which could be because of her character's past that had so many things in it. But, she still killed that performance.I think the reason that makes the film boring/slow/weak is that its story is very simple and it's set in one location (the couple's house) and one night. There are many films that are set in one location and were able to entertain the audience but this film's story is ""TOO SIMPLE"" and there is nothing special about it or something that would make you connect to this couple or makes the audience curious/excited to know what will happen next. NOTHING NEW AT ALL.The dialogues are the film's main thing. They were switching/jumping between conversations/topics about the history of cinema/filmmaking, how critics see films, some important political topics, and each character's past. And, In my opinion, the only ones that I was interested in were the most interesting were the ones about the characters' past, felt like these other topics were too much and were just added there to fill the film's runtime. They were so boring to listen to.The directing was great. Really loved the black & white in this film and its tone. There are also some visually stunning scenes that I enjoyed looking at. The set design (which is just the couple's house) is very beautiful and I really love it.The songs that were used throughout the film were all beautiful and reflecting the couple's story perfectly. But sometimes they were louder than the speech which made it hard to listen to what they were saying.To sum up, the film is a bit boring especially that it's full of dialogues that were sometimes good and sometimes not necessary at all. But it has some really great acting performances.My rating is 6.5/10","6","Bek204"," ""This is not a love story, this is a story of love""

We just, you know, go watch them. But it did provide ample entertainment watching him go on and on in his maniacal tirade. It also share some insight into the workings of certain relationships and how to approach certain situations within such relationships. All in all, good piece of cinema!

"1245","Before people watch this movie they must know what to expect, when you read Zendaya and John David Washington assuming the leading roles, one should know they are the only actors in the movie. Sam Levinson showed with Euphoria already that he is bold and unafraid to be authentic.
Levinson spoke with Zendaya daily about Euphoria during the pandemic, they were bored to be shut down and decided to make a movie, Covid-Friendly at Zendayas house. Apparently he already wrote half of the script for Washington before he even asked him if he was on board.
The result is stunning, amazing and brilliant and absolutely thorough and beyond. This film is definitely not for everyone, it will make people feel uncomfortable, it will bore some people and it will excite those willing to sink in.Levinson transformed a former Disney Teen into a serious actress with Euphoria, she is extremely good in this show but never gets to showcase her range, in Malcolm and Marie he lets her off the leash, worked parts of her Euphoria character in, created even an easter egg scene and whoever is still on board after 45 minutes will be impressed with her Oscar Performance. The same goes for Washington, a brilliant and unafraid delivery from the first to the last scene.The Dialogues are familiar and surprising and shockingly thorough, we all have been in their shoes more often as we want to and exactly that made this movie so interesting.

There is a perfect mix of humor, anger, and reflection written into the script. Normally I get bored of movies that take place in one location, but oh my god I could not take my eyes of this film. The performances were so raw and captivated how difficult relationships can be under the right stressors.

"1254","This movie isn't going to be for everyone. But that doesn't mean it's not an excellent movie.Our two stars return home from a premiere of Malcolms where an argument ensues after Malcolm forgets to thank Marie during his speech. Like a scab you can't stop picking, each character can't help but go back to push the line of hurting their partner one more time.The film delivers heavy hitting psychological jabs simply through the dialogue. It makes us question what it means to critique others intentions, it makes us question what our race plays in opinions and analysis, and it subjects us to many other complex issues solely through well performed dialogue with stunning noir cinematography.For those that have seen Euphoria, you'll have witnessed the writing ability of Levinson before. Levinson has shown with Malcolm and Marie that his talent goes even further, and that he's got a pythonic grip on reality with a superb talent for nudging audiences to reevaluate theirs.Both leads gave excellent performances. The only gripe I have with the casting unfortunately would be that although Zendaya gave an incredible performance, she looks too young to be playing Marie. Marie is meant to have been a junkie at the age of 20 but is now ""recovered"", Zendaya looks slightly too young and fresh faced as she only looks 20-22 on screen, because the dialogue constantly mentions the age of her drug induced years, it was just too hard to ignore - curse you beautiful skin! Regardless, this shouldn't take away from her performance and it is another weapon to add to her artillery of great work over the past few years.","8","slp-65008"," Malcolm and Marie
"
"1255","When it comes to one-location films, I'm usually cautiously optimistic every time. When this type of film is done right, it can really shine and be memorable for the filmmaking techniques involved throughout. The reason I'm usually cautious is due to the fact that there have been multiple films that don't do enough to hold your interest, leaving you bored with the scenery over and over again. Now streaming on Netflix, Malcolm & Marie is one of the latest films to take place entirely at one location. While it's very far from perfect, here's why I at least admired it so much.After the premiere of his first feature film, Malcolm returns to his rental home with his girlfriend Marie. Feeling high and mighty after the stellar response, his cockiness gets the better of him. This in turn releases an endless number of thoughts about each other. Essentially, this film is 106 minutes of arguing. That may not seem appealing, but it all comes down to whether or not you believe these characters, and I absolutely did.John David Washington has proven time and time again that he's a force on camera. Whether you're talking about BlacKkKlansman or smaller movies like Monsters and Men or The Old Man and the Gun, I've just loved his commitment to each role. On top of his great performance once again here, I think his co-star Zendaya actually stole the show from him on multiple occasions. Other appearing in Spider-Man films and being very solid in The Greatest Showman, I hadn't watched any of her earlier television roles as a child actress. It wasn't until her starring role in the HBO series Euphoria that I then told myself I need to see every future project that includes a performance by her. She has really come a long way as an actress and her performance in Malcolm & Marie felt incredibly raw and I loved every second of it.Where I feel this film falls apart is actually in the greatness of these performances and the stellar filmmaking overall. From the unique cinematography by Marcell Rev to the great direction by Sam Levinson (both of whom worked on Euphoria with Zendaya), Malcolm & Marie is simply too long of a film for the material being presented. It takes place over one night and follows a couple arguing in different rooms. Everything about the movie itself is elegant, but by the time it reached the second act, I started getting hints of Déjà Vu. I was sucked in by the camerawork and performances in the first act, I even liked where the movie ended, but certain conversations or things the characters were doing just started to feel incredibly repetitive. It felt like different versions of the same scene were happening over and over again.Overall, Malcolm and Marie is a massive showcase for how talented of a director Sam Levinson has the potential of being and also that John David Washington and Zendaya are both incredible performers. I feel disappointed in retrospect because there was so much potential on the table. It's not that the film fell apart, it's that after a while, there wasn't anywhere new to take this film on an intellectual level. Things are said later on in the film as a revelation, which I felt was already implied without saying a word earlier on. This movie was very confused with the notion of show-don't-tell. In the end, for film lovers like myself, it's absolutely worth a watch, but I really don't believe it was as good as it could've been.","6","kjproulx"," Very Repetitive with Stellar Performances

"1257","I found this film interesting because of how it was made: shot during a pandemic with very limited resources.

Glad to give Hollywood a glance at the little guys for a change.It was a well casted duo who carried a character driven script in one location, much like a two person play. The monologues were brilliant and endless. Zendaya steals the show early, but JDW catches up in the second half.

"1261","If you go into this film thinking it's an adapted theatre piece, you are going to really appreciate it. Being aware that it was set during a few hours of this couples night, that it was an intimate look into their lives, it was truely special. The blocking of each scene is so meticulously mapped out despite it looking so natural. The way there able to frame each character, like one character walking into frame by a mirror and the other leaning by a door frame, purely beautiful composition. And yet upon reading about the film, I see that some of the scenes had improvised blocking with a hand hold camera capturing each moment. In fact the first two days of footage for the opening scene was cut out in favour of a more relaxed improvised version, which spurred Zendaya to turn to John David Washington and say, 'This is how he works"". This film comes from Sam Levinson the creator and main director on the HBO hit 'Euphoria', and you can really see that the man has a way to beautifully capture a performance. He has a way to make each frame look so alluring and eye catching. You could tell Levinson has a short hand with his cinematographer Marcell Rév and the rest of the crew (from Euphoria) to pull off such a seamless film during a pandemic. Each shot is filmed and edited so harmoniously, with not a single shot or scene out of place. The pacing and dialogue is on point. And boy oh boy the driving vehicle of the film is of course the two powerhouse performances by Zendaya and John David Washington. They both have palpable chemistry that makes your heart skip a beat when each character says something cruel about one another. They both portray very complex and troubled characters. I've loved each of these actors for a while now, and I have to say foreseeably they smashed this project out of the park. I had moments where I despised Malcom, for what he said to Marie and moments that I relished of his (like his entrance/ dance scene). Zendaya's Marie at points seems unstable and yet the most rational in a scene. This film whilst fundamentally about a complex relationship, is in my opinion more geared toward people that either love cinema, or perhaps are an artist themselves. It is definitely a film that will please actors and filmmakers as they can appreciate both the way it was created and the way it was beautifully performed. But calling this film an art house piece is predictable. I mean come on it's filmed on 35mm black and white film! - Follow Ofcourse That's Cinema on Instagram, Vero and YouTube for more!","8","Icecoldheart"," Like a beautiful play, captured on 35mm film.

But I think these types of thought provoking films are usually like that. I've had many fights going through the entire night, both grown adults, crying, imagining the future of us being apart, both having foul things to say to each other.
Not being new to the situation depicted, I think it gives me much to think about. There's just so much to the relationship dynamic that shows when two are fighting. I personally think this is worth watching, but know what you're getting into, and make your own choice whether or not to watch this. Your mindset around the show will shape how you percieve it.","8","victory-748-144163"," Very real. More artistic.

"1263","First I want to give props to everyone involved in the film. Two people literally doing nothing but arguing is a tough sell (especially at 1hr 45 min) but I watched it through, and found myself engaged and entertained through a good chunk of it. The same reasons I enjoyed this movie will be the same others dislike it:1. It's pretentiousThis is a very wordy film. If you don't have an extensive vocabulary, you will feel insulted. While I admit that the verbiage is overdone more than once, Levinson's screenplay lets you know that Malcolm & Marie is for art house lovers, aka ""real movies"". And I appreciate that.M&M is also shot in Black & White (a beautiful choice, but still very pretentious). The cinematography is beautiful.
2. The actingJohn David Washington & Zendaya both killed it based on what they were given (see above point about the screenplay). I expect an Oscar nomination for Zendaya, and at least a Golden Globe nod for Washington, depends on how crowded the field is.3. Sam Levinson's styleAs a fan of Euphoria, I was happy to see Zendaya and Labrinth coming into the fold with Sam. As expected, the movie is sleek with a great soundtrack and editing.
Even with all those positives, this movie isn't about much, so I'll go with a 7. Expect some Oscar nods though.","7","vatsimmons"," Pretentious, gorgeous, and surprisingly captivating

"1264","Well, this movie is actually something. First of all you need to be in the mood to be capable of watch it and be a good experience.
In the begging of the movie i was wondering why this couple have no chemistry but quick realized that's kinda of the point. Is a deep hurt couple, they are so full of each other and that need to be reflected someway.
Is not my favorite movie but i think is a good one, is true and real.
I can understand why so many people didn't liked it, the script is heavy and and the theme is not easy to watch. You are literally watching a couple fight. They are not likable, they are not perfect, they are just two human beings.
About the performance of the two verry talented actors, i enjoyed, they dont make you feel good but that's the point, because the characters are not well, they are not good people, or bad, they are what they are and the actors put there so well on the screen. They are not trying to you like them, they are fighting to each other, simply as that.

"
"1265","This is a movie with amazing acting, beautifully shot, and music that stands out - yet doesn't distract. Those are some of the items that helped make this great. It is based on two people and their night together digging up the past. I feel it is trying to teach us a lesson. One that I will dive into below...Remember Lot's wife...
Third shortest verse in the bible.
""Cool and how does that apply?""
Let me explainLot's wife looked back on the old life they were living. The question is how did she look back? Did she look back longingly, in disgust, in amazement, in regret, with nostalgia, in anticipation that nothing will be better moving forward, was she excited for the next chapter, was she angry, was she sad, was she happy? Well, she was turned to a pillar of salt so we will never know.
As for this movie it is an example/warning of when we look back, and how we use it. Similar to the scripture I feel that this movie is advising us to be careful when looking back. If we dig up the past let's do it so that we can be better, let's not do it so we can fling around mud and make everyone else feel gross and dirty.
How do Malcom and Marie move on from such a tumultuous night? Hopefully side by side...
Does bringing up the past have consciousness? Yes, so be careful what you dig up because some things are better left unsaid. At the same time, don't bury things in your past without acknowledging them first. Just be careful with how that takes place. Use your words to build up, not tear down. If you have to tear it down, realize that you are damaging it in the process, and do so with such care and consideration that you don't leave another memory buried in your past in hopes that it never gets unearthed...
Malcom and Marie uncovered items from the past day and months/years that were hurtful, yet necessary to get them on the same page. Be careful with what you bury and what what you dig up.Okay enough preaching ;) back to my 8... Well I am sad that it ended. How do they move on? There won't be a sequel so don't leave me hanging. If we are to watch these two dig up the past and use it like that, what are the repercussions? Is that good, is it bad? Yes they said sorry, yes they said thank you. But I wanted more clarification, yet - at the sametime an 8 out of 10 is pretty high. Because this shouldn't be a perfect showcase of how to handle the past - but more a more glimpse of what it looks like when doing it. It's up to us to decide how or if we want to replicate this in our lives and more importantly with whom.","8","Valken-Industries"," Be careful what you grab from the past...

"1267","Sometimes, the best artistic endeavors come from odd or unplanned circumstances. Spielberg's shark malfunctions in Jaws? It ultimately sets the standard for unseen creepiness. Harrison Ford sick with a cold on the set of Raiders of the Lost Ark? Produces one of the most hilarious/endearing scenes of the entire film. In that same vein, ""Malcolm & Marie"" was created in the midst of a pandemic, thus necessitating only two leads, a stripped-down crew/location, and a rushed process. No time to make everything perfect or obsess over the small details. What results through this uncharacteristic process is an equally uncharacteristic cinematic experience.For a very basic overview, ""Malcolm and Marie"" tells the story of the titular lead characters coming home from Malcolm's (John David Washington) film premiere. While he's bouncing off the walls with energy, wife Marie (Zendaya) seems a bit perturbed. Viewers quickly come to realize that Malcolm forgot to thank Marie in a speech, and that rift sets off an argument that continues deep into the night.On the surface, it might be easy to see this flick as an angry one, or a pretentious one, or even an overly simple one. But it is anything but those things. Instead, it portrays the very human way that individuals communicate (or don't communicate) with each other and how that leads to repressed emotions and a buildup of emotional scar tissue. ""Malcolm & Marie"" rips through such old wounds to be an absolute treatise on how people argue or express emotions through conversation. Sure, not all may be able to put themselves in the exact shoes of a film producer and his insanely glamorous wife, but I can all but guarantee everyone has gone through a similar scenario with a spouse, significant other, parent, sibling, friend, etc. In other words, there is nary a person alive who won't be able to relate to what is transpiring between the two leads.On an even deeper level, director/writer Sam Levinson turns the tables on the characters so many times that by the end, viewers are as stripped to the bone as the arguing couple. For example, at equal points one will be ""in the corner"" or either Malcolm or Marie, but then quickly realize the situation is much more complicated. Fortunately, the end goal here isn't to crown an ""argument winner"". Instead, it is to show what the process looks like and what each party wants at the end of the long night.To accomplish this, terrific acting is needed--and gotten in spades. Washington is equal parts cool and likable, yet also extremely insecure and patronizing. He also delivers a few epic monologues here that remind me of his famous thespian father (Denzel). Zendaya matches him ""blow for blow"", if you will, slowly transitioning from ""don't want to do this right now"" partner to an emotional wreck as many old wounds/suspicions come home to roost. She also has a signature scene that will have you picking your jaw up off the floor.Sadly, all anyone seems to be talking about regarding ""Malcolm & Marie"" is the scene in which Malcolm (echoing a real-life event from Levinson's past) lambasts a critic for her review of his film. A bit of a controversial scene, but even then it portrays many truths wrapped up in a number of insecurities and passions. That's what one always gets with this movie--no hard and fast answers, but rather an emotional wallop that will leave you sorting through it for days after viewing.I truly hope that over time, people begin to see ""Malcolm and Marie"" for what it really is: an utter tour de force on the nature of arguments, relationships, and how difficult it can be to honestly express one's feelings to another. To my mind, there is much award-worthy material within its runtime.","10","zkonedog"," ""Thank You""

A small careless act ignites a nightlong battle between two lovers, the battlefield being each other's ego, self-worth, and shame.

During all the time I had the feeling that the producers wanted it to be ""the perfect Hollywood movie"" without succeeding, maybe if they didn't focus on that aspect it could have gained more positive reviews. After all, the acting was very good, the actors both gave all themselves and you can tell it by the length of their speeches and the emotions they show, but it was extremely repetitive and slow.At the beginning it was very nice but it should have ended there, it could have made much more sense.I gotta say that it gave me quarantine vibes, maybe they did it on purpose.","5","gaiacherici"," 50/50

"1276","Was looking forward to this movie because I am typically a fan of dialogue-heavy slice of life films and I was excited to see Zendaya and John David Washington. I thought the characters were great, but the story really fell short- it quickly became over the top and repetitive. It seemed like Sam Levinson wanted to flex his knowledge of film and make pretentious declarations about art. Disappointed.","3","justjuliaa34"," Pretentious, Repetitive, Self-Important

"1277","A movie were you start off feeling bad for the characters untill they become so stubborn and so unlikeable that the movie started to make me fall asleep.

"1278","I'm watching this movie thinking to myself, ""if a man ever spoke to me that way, I wouldn't tolerate it. I would simply leave."" But truth is, men have talked to me this way. I've been in countless relationships like this where I ride the roller coaster because the highs outweigh the lows. But do they really? And in the back of my head I'm thinking, I'll leave next time, if it gets worse. This film clearly wasn't very liked by critics, and I can understand why in some cases. They claim the movie is shallow, too pretentious to be genuine, but ultimately, it perfectly captures what it's like to be in an emotionally and verbally abusive relationship. Where the carrousel never stops and you don't even really know what's keeping you from jumping off. It's well written, a little too well written, yes, but it tells a story that many people can relate to.","7","megbee"," Heartbreaking and real

"1282","A recent Netflix release starring John David Washington & Zendaya. Taking place in a rented home during the night, we have our leads Washington, a filmmaker & Zendaya, his on the mend from drugs muse celebrating the reception his latest film has gotten. What starts out as a seemingly joyous celebration soon devolves into a night of accusations, recriminations & regret as Zendaya feels at first she wasn't thanked properly during his speech but then as the verbal scab pulling intensifies she reveals she wanted the coveted role (she is an aspiring actress) which puts Washington on the hot seat. Filmed in gorgeous black & white, writer/director Sam Levinson (Zendaya is front & center on his HBO adaptation series Euphoria) wisely lets the actors eat up the volleys as the words start to fly & sometimes catch metaphorical blood. The two leads are great here showing they're not just one trick ponies but actors of substance willing to go places others won't.","7","masonfisk"," DON'T FORGET TO SAY THE RIGHT THING...!

"1284","This is good, and annoying. The acting is great. It's impressive to see both of the actors bounce from intense to watching how they manage to use just the right words to cut each other. These are two highly intelligent people who know how to push each other's buttons. And while you always want to pick a side, part of the triumph of this movie, is that it's hard for the viewer to do. One of the partners near the end rather triumphs in making their point, but still you get the right and wrong from both of them. Kind of like any relationship. It's real; although, I'm not sure that most of us fight with quite the level of intellectualism of these two, but an hour and a half of bickering can't help but to be annoying.","6","eclec-28760"," Good, but annoying

The arguing was exhausting, so I guess drew me in although I had to turn the volume right down. However they were a captivating pair of talkaholics (seemingly on aderol). Realistically, considering the boundaries crossed, it was all a little over civilized, there wasn't even any interrupting. Also inconclusive because Malcom just wanted to win and Im not sure any of their problems were solved. Slightly disappointed on that front and not expecting a sequel, which I would definitely watch.","8","cathode-94655"," Team Marie

Recommended to me by Senpai, I was told it was going to be a slow film that picks up towards the middle. The film already had my attention when the couple's fight started as I drew relation to me and Senpai's arguments. I was curious to see what unfolded and how they resolved their disagreements.I found Marie's dialogue to be at times too complicated with the use of complex words which threw me off sometimes. As for Malcolm, I was disgusted with his behaviour at first, but it has become neutral at the end of the film. His rant towards the film critic from LA Times was awfully targeted and contributed little of the plot of the film.Senpai thought...","7","bigakuacedia"," More suited towards couples.

"1288","Not sold on a lot of what this offers, but the acting from Zendaya and John David Washington is absolutely phenomenal - flawless, in fact.The aforementioned duo are truly outstanding, I loved their performances from start-to-finish; whether it the more serious bits or the more amusing parts. Great delivery, best acting I've seen in a film in a while - no word of a lie.As noted at the top, I'm admittedly not fully sure about the rest of the film. I'm definitely not saying it's bad, disappointing or anything but I am unsure about it. Honestly though, the two leads take away any negatives I may have from the production's other departments. They elevate it, for sure.I'd fully recommend checking out 'Malcolm & Marie' - if only for Zendaya and Washington.","9","r96sk"," Not sold on a lot of what this offers, but the acting from Zendaya and John David Washington is absolutely phenomenal

"1289","I did genuinely enjoy this film. i can understand why some might not enjoy it as it can get repetitive and unrealistic at some points (of my knowledge) for example the fact that it all happens over just one night. i guess in some cases, stuff like that does happen just over one night but it felt a little forced in this film.zendaya and johns acting is very good and i did enjoy their dynamic. One part of the movie i found long and quite annoying was Malcolms rant scene about the ladies review. it felt like it was never going to stop and it felt forced.a scene that really stuck out to me was Zendayas 'thank you' speech at the end of the movie. it was so nice and refreshing to watch and listen to after all the arguments that had happened prior. she did an amazing job and it felt very realistic and you could tell that Marie was hurting deeply.but i must say, this film was very visually pleasing and beautiful. sam levinson did an amazing job cinematically and the shots throughout the film were just spectacular. i found myself complementing every scene. i liked the black and white filter, it made the movie seem calm even though the situations that were happening were very chaotic at some points.overall i did enjoy this film. it was a beautiful movie with very good actors in it, who did an amazing job.","7","loladaniels-35712"," enjoyable just a bit repetitive

"1291","This film is beautifully written, the cinematography was truly stunning, very single shot was like a painting. I've read through many of the reviews on here and there is a clear divide between people who recognise this incredible film as a work of art and people who think it's too boring or too long or too wordy. I see why this film may not be for everyone if you prefer action or fast past films, but its unfortunate they think it makes it a bad movie. The conversations are powerful, the true emotions in a arguement are presented so accurately and artful, I felt the pain the characters were feeling. This is a brilliant example of the extraordinary work a collection of talented people can produce. Labrinth's music is used so elegantly as a form of communication, the cinematographer's use of depth and framing in doorways, mirrors, windows to create visual barriers between the characters is exceptional, I was constantly in awe of this. Both Zendaya and John's acting was so powerful and moving, even in scenes of them silent, barely doing anything I simply couldn't take my eyes off the screen. People are complain because this isn't a conventional film, but millions of underrated art is dismissed because people are too lazy to interpt it. This is a film that wants to make you feel something, and I've never been so moved by a film. Thank you for making this, with the challenges of small crew and the pandemic you've created one of the greatest films, a true film with true emotion.","10","libbylbroadfoot"," One of the most incredible films I've ever seen, with consistently stunning cinematography

"1292","Reviews do not do justice to this movie with two black protagonists. Your average white American male critique wasn't ready to hear about the ""white critique"" afterall.There is so much to write about just a few points:Relatable characters and the story line: It is bouleversant, overwhelming, in a good way. In the midst of so many cheap hollywood comedies and excessively violent dramas, this is what you expect from a movie. It is relatable yet doesn't try to be a crowd-pleaser; it leaves you thinking without trying hard to be a ""festival movie"" either. Drug story was not necessary, the line is powerful on its own.Compatibility between actors: as someone who hasn't watched neither zendaya nor washington in any of their film before, I find them both perfect for their couple roles here. Not only the looks but the contrast in their voices and how they complement each other.Novelty: the choice of the location. the fact that it is shot during pandemic only in about 2-3 weeks which is genius and protagonists also actively take part in the production.","10","busrakarasu"," Hauntingly beautiful: Amazing music, cinematography, story and acting

The choice to present the film in all black and white represent the seriousness of the topic of the movie.The connection between this two is very good they transport us to the root of their relationship and their story. What it seems to begin with small problem turns out to be a roller coster of emotions that both wanted to scream at each other.I find it a little bit repetitive but when the fights rekindles they always have good arguments, but the tiredness stops once you realise the love for each other throughout the movie and especially her love in the end.
It's a movie that clearly transmits the relationship and the stories of the protagonists I think those ideas are very clear and congratulations to the actors and writers.Finally it's a very fluid movie the idea and message could be transmitted in less time but overall it0s a great effort and movie.Thank you and nice films!","8","goncalo-sales"," Introspection of very complicated relationship

"1299","From the moment Malcom and Marie walk through their door, there is a palpable sense of something awry. An intangible wall separates the two of them, conveyed through speech and movement.This is what makes this film special: whilst it relies on a heightened sense of what relationship arguments are based on (and could definitely have been shorter), there are fundamentals beneath that anyone who has ever cared for somebody else will have felt.Their nagging desire to continue any argument in the hope of stumbling to a resolution is so human it pains you to watch it. They make the same mistakes any other person would. Whilst their quarrels continue, you see their antagonism grow, as you begin to consider other influencing factors.The monochrome palette simplifies the set and enhances the lighting, all shot beautifully through clever camera placement and sharp focus. This benefits Zendaya and John David Washington, both actors who use their faces to maximum effect in conversation. I think what I most enjoyed was that it ultimately felt real.Arguments are hard to write; they require impulse, a selfish mind to shout what it feels, and this is what sets Malcolm and Marie out - the fact that I actually believed them. I think some people might have not enjoyed this film because ultimately, they probably saw some similarities with themselves.","7","harrylosborne"," Relationships under the lens
"
"1300","Every element of the movie made me feel essentially frustrated and I didin't understand why. However, translating it makes me believe that in relationships there are inexplicable feelings and in my reading this is what the movie is about. It is hard to understand ourselves let alone another person. There are several stories of the huge fights in relationships, but who talks about the feelings? The deep feelings that connect and separate the loving partners at the same time. If you think of an everyday fight between partners, you realize that it is nothing like in the movie, we wish it would be. In life people don't try to understand one another... they shout, break staff and interrupt each other. In the movie, in spite of the tension and contradiction the lovers listen, reflect and react to the other's speech. Most of all I adored the camera angles... the way they presented the distance between the two hears by putting the wall of the house between them, for example. The visual elements speak for themselves and help us understand the wars the characters fight in their souls. Yes, the war should be proclaimed against ourselves because deep down we create it not the other person. The movie consists of a mixture of contrasts: silence, long dialogues; hate, love; hurting, being hurt; woman, man etc. It has a unique atmosphere, lovely scenes, cuts, camera angles. It is pure art. The acting is incredible, they need to present inner pain, built up frustration and at times give irrationally long monologues. I liked the (often negative) feelings and thoughts that emerged in me during the movie, they are worth reflection. After one week, I still catch myself thinking of it so all in all I find it impactful.","8","Gn_opinionate"," Captures the inexplicable

"1302","A movie about communication or lack there of it. I really enjoyed the dialogue in this movie, however I thought it was unrealistic. The vocabulary that's used while the actors are full blown arguing, isn't realistic. I think this film is a good depiction of the dynamics of modern day relationships and the on screen chemistry between the actors is one of the best I've seen in recent times. They go from heated arguments to just about to make love really smoothly and naturally. The film is quite repetitive and is seemingly like mini loops of the same thing but with different arguments.
They both make really compelling arguments for what they are upset with each other but ultimately it's clear that they both need each other in different ways and for different things and they both have a need to be validated.","7","sydenham-00155"," Enjoyed it

"1303","The score and soundtrack was amazing- new RnB mixed with punchy jazz.The visuals are also spectacular- the house and filming location were gorgeous and I love a movie with a single location.
It's gotta be the most pretentious and unoriginal plot to make a movie about a filmmaker and then critique film critics during the movie.Zendayas character is so intelligent and it was very enjoyable hearing her articulate her thought on the relationship- however its unlikely that two people fighting so viciously would ever give each other the time to monologue.During the film Malcolm is clearly an abuser to Marie- who is much younger and has been made to be dependent on Malcolm as he takes away everything she likes about herself (including work opportunities) and rubs her past addiction in her face. This is not a toxic relationship- this is an abusive relationship where Malcolm is an abuser and shows signs of being a narcissist- and I don't think that point is driven home well enough for the audience to take that away from the film.Malcolm and Marie visually make a slightly awkward couple- Zendaya's tall and slender and doesn't quite match up with John David Washington's stout and burly- although they are both extremely attractive actors apart from each other.","7","tayloroverstreeta"," Beautiful but Obnoxious

Doing this film in black and white was brilliant. The void of color doesn't distract you from their narrative. It makes you focus on it. I cannot say enough about it. This was my revolutionary film.

Malcolm ultimately shows qualities of being a narcissist and is otherwise unredeemable as a partner while Marie is his softer, younger, more vulnerable victim who has been trapped in his clutches for all of her adult life and has little chance of escaping.","7","tayloroverstreeta"," Great visuals and soundtrack - but it is unrealistic that two people in a toxic relationship don't interrupt each other

"1310","Films like this are very hard to get right, mainly because they play out more like theatre than a 'movie'. Just two people confined by their words. However, I think the director manages to keep us, the audience, engaged with a great script, fine acting and striking black and white cinematography.
This film explores the Art vs Soul vs Human interaction that many artists struggle with. Literally consumed by their art to the point of destruction.
Malcolm is a man devoid of any empathy unless it revolves around the limitations of his art, whilst Marie is his sponge, an entity for him to feed on. Underneath their exterior are two people madly in love, struggling to recognise one another's qualities because they're consumed by finding meaning and/or recognition in their art.
Malcolm and Marie is a complex movie. It challenges you to listen. It wants you to feel its rhythm. It reminded me of once being a young person who took art way too seriously. It also made me want to eat mac and cheese at 2am!
Overall, refreshing cinema that has restored my faith in filmmaking.","8","aldo-64339"," Hope in Cinema Restored.

Two hours later we end with the same characters, but we know them better than their parents. In these two hours we get two of the best performances of the year. Zendaya and John David Washington are so incredible, that I don't know if this movie would have worked if they wouldn't have been cast. This entire movie is about their relationship. That means that if you don't care about them as a couple, the movie just becomes a forgettable overdramatic romance. But is isn't. From the moment these two arrived I was invested in the story and that didn't go away until the credits rolled. At the end it becomes a bit repetitive and long, but it's already amazing that you can amuse me with two hours of pure fights and monologues.

I watched it on a whim because I know the actors involved usually give good performances and I thought we shall see where this goes. The accuracy to which this film depicts domestic back and forth is like nothing else I've seen recently. The reviews saying this is dull are coming from those either single or not use to seeing drama without realty show pauses in between. This is life people, it's messy and it's boring and if your black and happen to frequent mostly white spaces, it might involve using the term ""white lady"" on more than a few occasions. Also the camp of entertainment critics providing negative reviews as a way to close ranks because he apparently called out one of your own. Get over your selves because while your head was so far up some place it doesn't belong you missed the Brilliant way this film depicts how a couple shapes one another, how with each argument they were growing becoming something more. This want just a couple going after each other. This was two people breaking each other down to the studs and rebuilding something new in its place. A higher respect for women. A new enthusiasm for life. A better work ethic. Better drive. Stronger determination. Gratitude. Appreciation and the unity at the end was not lost on me either. This was a solid film!

"1321","Definitely a tour the force. The last movie I saw like this, and I was reminded of it, was Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. Both Zendaya and Washington poured out the repressed emotions of their relationship with realism and sincerity. The writing was crisp and appropriately responsive to each character's verbal assault on the other.I saw a review that the movie was ""pretentious."" Not to my eye. There were no pretensions and carrying the verbal volleys in the confines of the house and in black and white assured there were no distractions from the focus on the dialogue.I will watch it again since a couple of the surprises will be behind me and I will digest the dialogue further.","9","mmcneil007"," Oscar worthy performances

"1322","Although there is only two people in one house, I was kinda expecting it to be more visually told. It was really nothing interesting about the visuals extending the core narrative of the movie. It kinda seems like the story and the visuals was thought as two separate entities. Which kinda suffers the film, more than it helps it.I think the story revolves around a past that we really can't access to. And there really isn't that much at stake for the relationship to survive or not. It kinda feels like an exercise that is often common in film school. Or trying to critique established normative rules within films without actually making it work.The anger and dysfunction seem to come out of nowhere and persist through the entire movie. There is a lack of a build up, and we have no understanding of what is actually the character motives and desires. And why they do as they do. I also would think that a story taking place in a presence, would have more effort in the presence. A more interesting story would perhaps be that they were waiting for a car taking them to a premiere. Then it would also make sense to have a conflict around things that have happened, and what is going to happen next. Then it would actually be suspenseful.It kinda seems like the story has already happened, and we are watching the review and not the movie.","7","Bleke01"," Decent and worthwhile but lacking

"
"1328","While having never read the book, the premise of the movie was intriguing. To me, it seemed like the perfect wish fulfillment, a movie about girls fighting back and making waves. Ultimately, I was left feeling a tad empty and like many of the ""intersectional"" moments in the film were unearned.Without spoiling the film, I want to say that intersectionality is more than simply including women with various identities. A transgender character is given one line about dead naming, but then isn't given any sort of character arc. Two characters are revealed to be LGBTQ+ in a single kissing scene, but we don't see them really speak to each other the rest of the movie? My cynical side believes this was done so the movie could be shown in more countries by editing out these moments. Much space is given to the main character and her journey with feminism, boys, and her family, which I think was a mistake. There were really fascinating characters that could have built a fantastic, intersectional ensemble cast. Give this cast a plot that investigates the nuanced, experienced journeys of feminine people! Instead we're given throw away lines about gender, disability, ethnicity, race that feel like a screenwriter checking off boxes. Only the character with a mobility disability is ever actually funny with her quips at able-bodied extras.Despite my qualms with the story we were given, this is a well directed movie with great performances. Only in a few scenes did the absurdity of the plot get in the way of believability (the principal knowing dismisses a few things that at most high schools would have resulted in at least an investigation). I won't watch again but I'm glad this movie exists for today's high schoolers as it portrays a positive representation of a high school cishet relationship, friendship among girls, and (of course) feminism.","5","dejohnam-98420"," Could have been great

"1329","I think that this movie is going to wind people up. Which is hilarious because that is the whole point of the movie to get under peoples skin and make them think.Most people that see this film and dislike it are going to do so because they see them selfs reflected in the people the movie is talking about.I think that this movie will really be an empowering movie for teenage girls. Lots of films try to do this but i think that this movie succeeds where others don't because it doesn't pander to its audience. It was grounded for the most part.Some characters did border on cartoony, which brings me to my biggest issue with the movie. The actor of Mitchell. He wasn't a very good actor anyway but the worst part was how old he looked. He is nearly 30 and i know that this happens in lots of shows and movie and probably he isn't the only one not playing his age in this movie. The issue is that he just stuck out like a sore thumb. Every time he was on screen i was like ""Oh there is an adult man"". It was just incredibly distracting. He was meant to be 16?Another small issue i had was the back end to the second act and the beginning of the third. It seemed to lose its focus and fell off the tracks a little bit for me.Thankfully it finds its way when it begins to wrap the movie up. I think the ending is really great, i do wish it wasn't over as abruptly. I think this could have been fixed by trimming the movie down and then just giving a few of them minutes to the end.This movie was really good and i think that people should see it. I do however think that this movie is going to get a lot of hate and bad reviews because it is a feminist movie so make sure you watch it and support it.","7","Golden_Hope"," Empowering
"
"1330","Good intentions, but I think it falls flat because of the genre confusion and cringy writing. My biggest let down was that, sadly, this movie doesn't walk the walk itself. It's filled with double standards. It talks about not judging women by their appearances, but then has a slo-mo shot of the ""good guy"" pulling up his shirt while skating, as the main female characters drool. It doesn't address how good guy Seth is also being portrayed as a hero, while litteraly just behaving like a normal human being. That would have been a great way to show how women have to be extraordinary in order to be noticed, but men are celebrated for being civil. A lot of the characters are extremely cliché and cringy and I agree that this movie doesn't really work outside of the US. As a European it's hard to connect with this genre - the mix between a serious topic and a light vibe doesn't feel like a success with this movie. I recommend that you watch ""Unbelievable"" instead.","5","maibritt-589-918706"," The double standards are a let down

"
"1332","The concept of the story was very strong but it was so poorly executed by the screenwriters. There were way too many storylines that, as a result, all fell flat. Moments of the story that were clearly meant to have a lot of emotional weight felt completely empty because there was barely any build up to them. The writers should've chosen one of the arcs to focus on and really honed in on that; Kiera's storyline would've been great for this.If the majority of Moxie's attention turned towards working on Kiera winning the scholarship, as in, they spent lots of time and energy campaigning only to have her lose to Mitchell who only won due to his reputation, popularity and generally him just showing up, then her loss would've hit much harder. Seeing all of the characters cry when she lost felt so forced, it was honestly cringy.Also, the tokenism was real. It would've been so lovely to see the girl in the wheelchair or the transgender girl have a significant role. Instead, they just kind of float around on the sidelines, not really contributing to the action of the story. The fact that I can't even remember their names is telling. Frankly, it felt like they were just shoved in to spice up the story with 'diversity' when really it felt lazy. The transgender girl's aspiration to play Audrey in the production of Little Shop of Horrors could've also been a major storyline, a campaign that Moxie really fought for.It is even mentioned that the transgender girl is facing a lot of discrimination and that intersectional feminism is key, yet these topics/themes are never picked up again or given the time of day. Again, it feels like these parts were just thrown in for the sake of slapping on a 'diversity' badge and then the writers called it a day. It isn't enough. It's time that these characters who represent marginalised demographics actually provide something for the story.Overall, it was just a very weak attempt at representing fourth wave feminism and I don't think it did the movement justice. Also, it legitimately just like, wasn't funny. Like, it was meant to be a comedy and genuinely the jokes just weren't good. So, big nah.","3","hi-floyd"," Had potential but was so poorly written

"1335","The movie was really good at first, but it tanked in the end. Nothing was resolved and nothing changed. Pointless property damage stood in for actual change.The principal's trophy was a good example. Real change would have been shown by her realizing, thanks to the actions of our spunky heroines, she was contributing to the problem. Then she looked at that trophy and understood she wasn't the best principal and destroyed it herself.Or the rape accusation - sure, it's great the girl said it out loud and was believed, but does anyone think anything will come of it? We all know what the legal and social system is like. He'll claim it's more of the persecution he talked about in the morning announcement segment. Plus, the one girl admitting she tripped the guy who's the Pirate mascot? That's not feminism, that's assault.And what did they do when the girl lost the scholarship? Nothing. They didn't find someone to give her another scholarship that was even better. They didn't show the guy giving the scholarship that the soccer team was worth supporting, they didn't ask for a count of the votes. It was just forgotten about.Vivian never took responsibility for her unhelpful and cruel actions - we never see her apologize to her mom or her mom's boyfriend. She gives a small ""I'm sorry"" to Seth, but I wasn't convinced.This seemed exceptionally performative and poorly thought out. Rah rah, girl power, but let's not do anything to actually change the underlying paradigm that has serious flaws.","4","linda-846-907013"," I expected better from Amy Poehler

It kinda feels like it completely forgot what it was trying to say, but picked it up again after a while. It also is a bit awkward with the way the teens speak. I'm a teen myself and I have never heard someone say: 'That's rad!' But I have to admit, it was really nice to see these girls stand up for themselves. The 'villain' of the movie is a bit too much in my opinion, but there are people in this world like him. There are human being who behave like that, and it's really uplifting to see the girls unit. I actually stood up at the end speech because I felt what these girls have been trough. The movie is really cleverly written, and it makes it so that we really start to care for a girl that we don't know. I just leave this movie with a very positive feeling and I hope there are teens out there who will feel inspired.","7","joostkale"," Makes some mistakes, but it's message inspires

"1345","This is a movie of could haves. It could have been a great flick. It could have been smarter with its depictions of sexism, racism and homophobia. But it doesn't. It is a generic movie that simply happens to talk about feminism. And that's it.It is as manichaeist as it gets. The bad guys are constantly bad, as irredeemable as possible. The good guys are saints, only lacking the halo. Sexism is not shown, it is shot like a missile at the scream. Subtlety simply does not exist.The acting is subpar, but that's understandable, as it relies on mostly young and inexperienced actors.With that, it is very hard to stay engaged with it. There is no actual thinking needed, as every situation that is presented is black and white. So, when it ends, it'll just fade. It provokes nothing, it changes nothing.

Two of the girls kiss once and its never addressed or developed. I understand that they don't want to take away from the overall theme, but to me it just felt like a token scene, like they threw it in to seem ""woke"".

The overt and straightforward way that this tackles extremely complex subject matters will definitely not work for some people. But I think the film is definitely aware of this fact, and instead tries to create a more upbeat and simple portrayal of feminism, and in that regard I think it works well. Amy Poehler's direction is solid, the performances are good and the first two acts in particular are pretty enjoyable. I do think the focus should have been more on some of the side characters, who all things considered were much more interesting, but that doesn't mean that the lead character's arc wasn't pretty strong. It is a bit too long for its own good, and again oversimplifies a complicated topic, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that I had a smile on my face when the credits started to roll.

There are people who will knock this movie saying it's just the classic crazy feminism(the type that says all men are bad and and doesn't shout equality), but this movie I think hits on point of the right type of feminism that promotes unity and respect, and equal treatment of women who don't get heard when they speak up.","7","macwright-46529"," Good movie, spreads what feminism should be

"1361","So this film is about feminism. If you remove that from the story, almost nothing is left. But that doesn't make it a bad movie. I liked the girls, they were so beautiful and vibrant, and the idea that some people are being ignored and stepped on systematically should feel disgusting to all, so it was a story worth telling. The acting was very good for young people and the direction was good, too.Yet it's not a perfect film. There was a moment when a girl admits to tripping one guy who broke his hand and not apologizing about it because that's feminism. No, it's not! And while the girls were from all kinds of races and had their own well shaped characters, the guys were just black and white: the nice sensitive down with feminism guys and the total complete asshole athletic rapists or complete morons. Other than about 4 guys, the others just don't have any lines, it's solely about the girls and their viewpoint. The message here is ""shout out! express yourself however you want! nothing can stop you!"" when reality is that, yes, it can stop you quite hard. So for that reason alone, I call it a feel good movie, because it was like an extreme caricature of life.Bottom line: yes, it's an Amy Poehler vehicle to push her agenda, but it is also a feel good movie about girls finding their voices. I also felt that Lala stole the film, because she came off as much more centered and powerful (not to mention beautiful) than the lead actress. Also, the poster for the film almost made me skip it.

It's a bitter pill to swallow from the beginning. But this isn't about the guys, it's about the girls. United in a growing tour de force behind the guise of a clever high school magazine. The premise is clear and that's a good thing, film work was excellent, writing was good and covered a lot of issues (though some issues seem to be chucked in there like the writers were ticking things on a checklist).

"1368","I had high hopes for this film which were very quickly dashed. The main problem is that it doesn't know what it is. Is it a teen comedy, a coming-of-age tale, or a hard-hitting commentary on the systemic sexism and toxic masculinity that persists throughout society? For the most part it is nothing more than a very predictable, formulaic teen comedy, it just happens to also have a plot that proports to tackle the very vaguely labelled 'sexism' in the protagonist's high school. There's no reference to this being a wider problem, it is very much centred entirely around one 'bad apple' in one high school, and in doing so dismisses any idea that this might be global, systemic issue. Throughout the film we see constant sexual harassment, toxic masculinity, gaslighting and gross failures from teaching staff in their duty of care that's tantamount to abuse. And yet, ironically, none of these acts are depicted with the severity they warrant - it's all just considered 'sexism' and it largely remains light and 'funny'. Blink and you'll mis the trans character, who mentions that she's not allowed to audition for a female role in the school play, like its just an annoying inconvenience and not a child being discriminated against by her teachers. I did actually blink and miss the same sex kiss between two of the girls. Both really important issues that are introduced and then totally ignored thereafter. But worst of all, literally minutes before the end, the film decides to get dark and a rape is introduced (just another example of this pesky sexism)! But again, after shoehorning in this totally random 'plot twist' minutes before the end, again, there's no follow up - not one person suggests the victim report it to the police, the rapist gets no comeuppance; it's not even implied by maybe a shot of a police car approaching the school; he's not even stripped of his scholarship, nothing other than the totally inept, part-of-the-problem, neglectful, abusive head mistress calling him to her office! In a film that is claiming to be challenging sexual abuse and misogyny, it's infuriating that they didn't bother seeing this last-minute addition through to a conclusion that would have supported that message! But hey, the victim got to put on a pretty dress and go to a party with her new girlfriends, who all show their support by saying they believe her, so thank goodness for that!

"1378","I love the coming-of-age movie, Moxie! It has comedy, drama and a terrific message, while handling very serious topics. The cast is perfect, and the music gives the film a lot of energy.Moxie is based on the novel by the same name by Jennifer Mathieu and follows a 16-year-old girl named Vivian (Hadley Robinson) who prefers to be under the radar. This all changes when Lucy (Alycia Pascual-PeÃ±a) comes to her high school. After witnessing Lucy ""holding her head high"" during an encounter with another student, Vivian notices all of the horrible ways that girls are being treated at her school and decides to publish an anonymous zine that sparks a fire in all of the other fed-up girls at her school.Amy Poehler directs the movie and plays Vivian's mom. She also happens to be my favorite character, because she is very clever, inspiring and is not a ""traditional mom."" The rest of the cast plays their characters so well. We see Vivian's journey from follower to leader. Lucy is such a bold and confident woman, standing up for what is right. Seth (Nico Hiragra) comes across as a really cool love interest of Vivian's and male ally to the female revolution. Patrick Schwarzenegger's portrayal of Mitchell Wilson is terrific, as I just hated him in the movie. The supporting characters are very diverse as we see people of all shapes, sizes and races, including a girl in a wheelchair, which I rarely see in movies, plus an all-girl band.The key messages in this film are: to be the change you want to see, and friendship can support that change. You should know that the film has some mild profanity, shows underage drinking and handles some mature subjects.I give Moxie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults.

"1380","I guess I should start this by saying i'm definitely not the target audience for this, but ... Moxie has some powerful and meaningful messages, but it's heavily drowned out by its modernity and clichÃ©s. It's modernism isn't subtle in the slightest using modern liberal white girl slang and some typical dialogue you hear thrown around in modern day ""progressive"" films that waters it down as almost like a corporate ""we understand you"" type of way. For a high school film it's not too bad, but extremely unrealistic how high schools run and act that make for some major eye-roll moments. The story is powerful enough to get some movement behind it, but it just feels like a typical high school rebellious film with a lot of feminist activism thrown into it that felt heavily forced. I get that the movie is about that, but it felt like it had to shovel it down your throat for you to get the point when it could've been way more subtle and therefore, I feel, more impactful.","4","chandean-69762"," Moxie 2021 Review

"1386","It was refreshing to see a good quality teen flick that wasn't about the main protagonists trying the get 'laid' by prom night... This had some strong female characters, and a simple but interesting premise. Fighting back, high school style, against the social inequalities and sexism that unfortunately still exist today... They could t seem to get any real traction or help from those in the school system that should be there to help... In the trailer you hear the Principal say 'don't use the word harassment, then I have to do a whole heap over paper work.' Pathetic to think this may actually be the reality for many young people in need of help in our state school system.The main antagonist, captain of the football team, although a stereotypical character, was needed for the narrative to move at the pace it did. This character was a bit too cartoonish and over the top at times, and would have been better if it was played more restrained and realistic.The fact that the main character used an old school paper newsletter to spread her thoughts, and get other people on board for the cause was great. You see her manually cutting and pasting words and images to make these cool little booklets, then ride down to the local copy place to make photocopies. This could have so easily been done as an 'on-line' blog or similar. But it wouldn't have had the same visual impact as seeing all those high school students socialising by reading and discussing the newsletters content... So good.I felt it finished a bit abruptly and really could have 'kicked off' with an unexpected ending that the audience didn't see coming. As it turns out, the ending was fine, just too easy and obvious for a film of this nature. If you have seen 'promising young woman' this could have been organised to be a very clever prequel from their high school days...Enjoy...","6","jacoblevy884"," Good teen flick...!

"1387","Feminist review alert!I absolutely adore this film. The music is so freaking awesome. The cast is diverse. My only criticism is that the Mitchell plot ends in a sort of generic way (allegations). I liked the incorporation of the classic books vs. modern books debate.

"1389","This film attempts to tackle some big issues such as bullying and sexual assault. However, it tries to do it with a level of lightness that does not fully work. Should it have been a more serious film? That is a question that needs to be answered by those who watch it. But sometimes serious subjects need to be presented in a more serious fashion. The age group that this is targeted at can take it because they are on the front lines of these issues. The portrayal of strong young adults with a social conscience is never a bad thing. That is what makes it a movie to watch and not totally dismiss.","6","dandbhouse"," Too light for big issues?

"1392","I'll try to keep this brief.Do not watch this movie. Even worse than sending the wrong message, it combines good messages with bad messages and makes no attempt to help the audience tell which is which. The main character is vindictive and petty, and never seems to face consequences for her actions; which only further muddies the waters of a movie that is supposed to have a message. Even worse, the main characters will often hurt people who are entirely innocent and unrelated to the things that they are trying to change. ""Collateral damage"", if you will.The antagonist is less and less evil throughout the movie, and is basically only turns from the rival to the antagonist at the end of the movie because he does something really evil, entirely out of left field. This only further tries to cement the message that the main character is the moral person because by comparison, their antagonist is worse.For a movie like this that is supposed to have a message, it is very thoroughly misguided. I do not recommend watching it or showing it to those impressionable.","2","simplynouo"," Misguided and Sloppy

"1393","I like female empowerment movies. So I was intrigued by the plot and because of Amy Poehler. It is watchable and the end scene was a somewhat empowering moment (aside from the girl who randomly admitted to tripping the mascot, that's not feminism). I feel the script didn't do the topic justice. I think it had the potential to be a great movie, but the script felt very robotic and like it was written by an amateur writer. In this story the subject was just thrown into your face, rather than giving it depth.The principal was written too one dimensionally for instance, as to where it wasn't believable. I also found the lead teen a bit irritating at times. Yes, it's an important issue but the dinner scene with her mother and her new boyfriend was cringe and made me lose a lot of respect for the character. She acted like an immature child and her mother literally didn't even tell her to stop once at the table, until she stormed off to her room. Things didn't go well for her at the time, but there's no reason to act like a spoiled brat. Not even an apology to her mother was shown. Also, the 'List' that was going around school, would've resulted in an automatic suspension in the real world today. All in all, it's worth watching and it has a good message, but needed improvements.","4","Dog-River"," Good Message, But Poorly Executed

"1402","North Hollywood (2020) is the directorial debut of Mikey Alfred, the creative director and founder of the first teen movie studio and skateboard/clothing brand, Illegal Civilization is a film that I have been anticipating for a while now especially since this was produced by Pharrell Williams. NH is a biopic, centered around Mikey, a high school water polo player/alter boy set on his course of being a pro skateboarder. This isn't without its obstacles as his dad and others, mostly Mikey himself, get in his way of achieving his dream. I had the pleasure of attending one of the live stream dates and it felt like such a unique occasion as everything has transitioned to some sort of virtual platform. Least to say that this was a very cool experience for me and I'm sure the rest of the viewers. This movie is not the best movie out. I was definitely expecting more from the Illegal Civ group, but what I saw was an elongated Illegal Civ YT video. I love music don't get me wrong, and music heavily influences the films that I script-write, but a lot of it seemed unnecessary. Some transitions seemed like they were in there because they ""looked and sounded cool"" which they did, but totally threw off the whole tempo of the film. The acting was subpar, especially from Ryder. I love you bro, but you definitely have a long way to go. I will say that some of the performances where very surprising to me, Angus, Nico, Armais, all really well done by them. The scene with Gillian Jacobs was great. I just have problems with the main cast. Miranda Cosgrove didn't really add much for me as Mikey's love interest. Not very compelling when she was on screen. Vince Vaughn as Mikey's dad had his moments, however there were parts where it was hard to distinguish his ""caring"" moments from his ""lecture"" moments. I think this was a great casting job however, but I think this leads into one of my main gripes with the movie, being the script. There were parts in this movie where it felt very natural, however there would be little instances of what I call ""novel dialogue"", sounding like someone is reading from a novel, which really throws thing off during the watch. There were some technical issues when it came to rack focusing, but overall the cinematography was very classic Illegal Civ, which is a good thing as it is unique to them. It is a beautifully shot movie, the set designs, the fits where all very well done. Overall, I see the potential, I really do, but this film left more to be desired. The editing choices, the acting, the script really slid this film of the rails for me. I will be looking out for more films by Illegal Civ however because you guys are sick and I love what you are doing! Keep at it!","4","brandenthanadabouth"," b reviews NH

"1406","Set against a backdrop of a sun-kissed San Fernando Valley, Mikey Alfred's North Hollywood acts as a heartfelt love letter both the neighborhood of North Hollywood, and the art form of skateboarding. Having followed Alfred's journey with the distribution of North Hollywood for over a year, I was ecstatic to finally see the end result, and I was not disappointed at all.For those who aren't aware, Mikey Alfred has been building quite an impressive resume for over a decade now. Most notably, starting the skate team, turned clothing line, now production company, Illegal Civilization at the age of twelve. Since then, Alfred has gone on to be the touring videographer for artists like Frank Ocean, Tyler The Creator, Kendrick Lamar, just to name a few. He's directed countless music videos, short films, all while running Illegal Civilization. If he's not already a household name, he's going to be in the next five to ten years, I'm calling that now.Alfred's directorial debut, North Hollywood, follows Mikey (Ryder McLaughlin), a high school senior dead-set on becoming a pro skater, while his father, Oliver (Vince Vaughn), believes he wants what's best for Mikey; to go to college and follow the ""traditional"" route of life after adolescence. Mikey attempts to find a balance in spending time with his two best friends, Jay (Nico Hiraga) and Adolf (Aramis Hudson), pursue a career in skateboarding, build a relationship with his love interest, Rachel (Miranda Cosgrove), all while the father-son relationship between Oliver and Mikey is suffering as a result.Having been personally invested in Illegal Civilization and Mikey Alfred's creative endeavors for years now, it was clear how important it was for North Hollywood to be made, not only to those involved, but to the skateboarding community as a whole. The year leading up to this release, Alfred was not shy to talk about his deep appreciation for old hollywood. Commonly dropping names like Robert Evans, or Martin Scorsese, in interviews. Now having seen North Hollywood, all of those mentioned influences are extremely apparent, specifically in the cinematography. Throughout the film, you'll notice these beautifully wide, panoramic shots as they seamlessly flow down and around the scene setting. This ends up being a two-birds-one-stone situation, paying homage to the visual elegance and theatrical elements seen in the previously mentioned influences, as well as acting as a visual representation of skateboarding to an extent, it's all in the flow of a scene.There's something very different about the coloring and texture of North Hollywood as well. The only way I can accurately describe it, is rich. Not rich in the sense that it's overbearing or distracting, but in the sense that it's clear just how much love Alfred has for his town and skating. While this might come across as poetic, I interpreted the rich color palettes as a visual representation of the passion a filmmaker has for the subject matter.I could go on and on about North Hollywood, but the bottom line is that this being Mikey Alfred's feature length debut, he knocked it out of the park. The passion behind this project and the subject matter comes through crystal clear, which is all you can ask for as a filmmaker. I can't wait to see what Illegal Civilization has coming in the future, and can only hope they get to work with the same crew, because they struck lightning in a bottle with North Hollywood.","9","adiohater"," Mikey Alfred Has Struck Lightning in a Bottle

We all just looked at each other and started laughing. The movie made me feel at home. Like how no other movie has ever made me feel.

The movie has some universal themes that everyone encounters at one point in life. Aside from great characters and engaging dialogue, the conflicts in the film really sell the movie. The mistakes and conflicts feel real instead of just another part of the movie. It makes the movie feel more like you're watching a version of yourself. That makes the film that much more engaging because there's some wisdom to be learned by the end of all the chaos. Great movie.

I payed the 18$ to watch it before it was released on iTunes and I can wholeheartedly say I wish I would have waited. The character was so hard to root for that I started to enjoy watching his life become a mess. Good actors are totally wasted and there's massive parts of the movie that are super dumb and have no purpose in furthering the plot. Like the lame scene with the joke that fails and all the homies are shaking their heads. Also the scene at that sketchy apartment when he gets beat up. This movie is so highly rated because all the kids who can't think critically don't want to seem like haters and actually admit the movie sucked. It's cool that this was made by skaters, for skater, starring skaters but when it comes to being a movie this was atrocious.

The movie brought back many feelings, memories and experiences that I had back in junior and senior high school.

The dialogue's alright. The friendship between the three friends was portrayed realistically. That's one thing that was done right in this film. As I mentioned before, the one thing that made this film enjoyable was the cinematography. That wide lens look is what kept me from looking away. I would love to see more films shot with a wide lens.Overall, the film was just alright. I think if Illegal Civ keeps making more films they might be on to something.","7","r34lz"," It's alright. The cinematography was the best quality of this film.
"
"1423","Overall I thought the movie was solid, if you like Illegal Civ and you have watched some of their videos before than you'll appreciate what this movie is. But this movie was all over the place, there was multiple stories I felt with not enough detail to them and some of the actors lines felt very pushed ahead instead of having time for the actors to fully grow. The one thing that I could compare this to is Illegal Civ Summer 17, it felt like a longer movie version of that series.","6","mwjarrett-59631"," Good for Mikeys first time

"1424","Horth hollywood is good, but if you followed the films production, underwhelming. Most of the feedback for this film is from a very niche crowd who love illegal civ and therefore love the movie. Famous skaters and spots distract fans from the piss poor dialogue and average and ultimately pointless story.North hollywood is a boring coming of age story with culture. Its worth the watch if you are a fan like myself, but otherwise, i couldnt convinve you to care. Its a painful review to leave because i love mikey and ic but this movie is just not that good.","5","benkirilo"," features carry this film

"1426","Watching this movie I was constantly reminded of Mid90s and actually thought Jonah Hill had made another identical movie, but no.The cast is similar, but that's about all these two movies share.Speaking of the cast, it's mostly good, with some oddballs here and there.Cinematography is good and really sets the mood well.Storywise it falls kind of flat, for me it lacks a crescendo or specific point where the movie kicks off, it also lacks any real resolvment for any of the characters.There is character development, but not nearly enough that I am left with anything substantial.The mood, setting and cinematography is what's keeping me from rating it lower.","4","mattiasjakobssonen"," Mid90s mood, but not the same gurth to it

"1436","The whole movie does very well in developing the nature of the relationships that are present. Where the characters are intricate yet have a very relatable sense to them. The presence of great cinematography that can be compared to ICs mini-series ""Summer of 17"", makes it worth watching with that factor alone.

"1438","North Hollywood could not have more direction. Every scene and all dialogue was thought out and served a purpose. The male friendships highlighted in this film are unlike any other I've seen--genuine and raw. The character of Rachel was the definition of a women who can advocate for herself and had depth/purpose in Michael's journey to become pro. The performances by both Amaris and Ryder were absolutely incredible. Great job IC and congrats Mikey.","10","maggiemcgraw"," I'M TELLING YOU I'M GOOD ON THE BOARD POPS

"1439","It's been some time waiting for this film to be available for us living outside of the US but it was definitely worth the wait. You can feel the work that has been put in while making the film, a sense of community and collaboration unlike much else. It's nice to watch a film focusing on skating where the people behind the camera actually understands skating and how to accurately portray it. North Hollywood takes place in a specific environment but its core is just as universal and timeless as any other coming-of-age tale and for many viewers, this will be their life/story finally told on screen. I'll leave the rating 9/10 as of now since I feel like I need to watch the film a second time to really settle on a rating. However, just going by my heart, it's a win across all boards.UPDATE: Well, I just watched it again and I'm just going to bump this up to a 10/10. There's so much heart and vibrancy in this film and I'm just so glad projects like this actually can get made today in this scale. If someone out there is still thinking this film doesn't have an audience, you're a fool.","10","b-ere-94"," North Hollywood is a film as timeless and universal as any other coming-of-age tale

"1440","This movie has been something ive been waiting on for a while and i kid you not im farther then satisfied. This movie not only shows the audience the grind and risks there is to follow your skating dreams but also for anything your passionate for. Mikey and the whollleeeee crew has said multiple times that they want to inspire and to be that catalyst for people to pick there board back up or to go make a movie just like he did or to follow your dreams whatever that may be. The acting was top notch especially because not a lot of them are actual actors. The lil poem Ryder said at the end was soooo wholesome, really teared up. And yes, yes i did stay up till 5am but it was 100% worth it. It definitely hit home when your parents/guardians doubt you on your decisions which make you doubt yourself and you loose hope. But if anything this movie has gave back that hope. Thank you IC for this amazing opportunity, much love and follow your dreams guys.","10","safagegr"," SOMETHING I WOULD BE PROUD TO TELL MY KIDS I WAS APART OF GAME CHANGING AF

"1441","Although I'm a big supporter for Illegal Civ & their amazing content from merchandise to videos, i tried keeping an unbiased view on 'Noho'. When you bring big names like Vince Vaughn, Miranda Cosgrove, and producers like Pharrell Williams & Noah Centineo it made me wonder what they will deliver to the table. What Mikey Alfred did for North Hollywood was put those pieces mixed in with his Illegal Civ cast and it was orchestrated beautifully. This movie's was authentic to its core. Tight Script, great production design, stellar cinematography, beautiful soundtrack (still waiting for the track-list), and a cast that gave it a 'Go Big or Go Home' mentality. Such heartfelt performances that prove these actors have a big future. It was a Fresh Breath of portraying teenagers in a feature film. For an Illegal Civ fan, it felt like a continuation of Summer of '17 fused with GODSPEED & IC3 but with its own script and a budget. For a movie go-er, North Hollywood set a bar when it comes to independent film making. Illegal Civ changed my life and got me into skating and I cant imagine what it will do for generations to come. Big Shoutout to Mikey Alfred for capturing the essence of skating & teenage life.Lets hope there are more screenings to show to my whole family. Watching this with my friends was an unreal moment but I feel that watching it with family members who don't understand the concept of skating will get something out of this. Every skater at one point has experienced the ""skating is pointless"" or ""skating is for bums"" talk from their parents. What North Hollywood does is show the pros & cons of skating with perspectives from the skater, family, friends, & lovers. Many blessings to the Cast & Crew behind Illegal Civ & everyone surrounding it. They have a gem of a movie that will mean something for kids. I hope theres a DVD box set to show the kids in the future.Thank you Illegal Civilization for the amazing film!","9","louiecouv"," Fresh Breath / Tell your Family

"1442","As someone that's starting out in the skating community I've been watching a lot of these movies. North Hollywood combines skating, struggles with friendships, love, and finding your way in life. North Hollywood does so perfectly. No matter who you are there are parts in this movie that will make you laugh. I feel that a lot of parents may relate to Vince Vaughn's character and their kids may find themselves in Michael, Adolf, and Jay. It's truly an amazing movie that you have to see.","10","zuzubrodsky"," Amazing Film MUST WATCH

"
"1445","The movie has such a distinct aesthetic that is so exciting to watch. The soundtrack, the cinematography, the writing, so good.I thought that Michael was such an interesting character to watch develop, and how you don't necessarily have to root for him. It's a very refreshing take on the whole 'loveable anti-hero' thing. Mikey also does a great job of establishing the relationship between the Michael and his father. Vince Vaughn is incredible as Michael's pops, I won't spoil it but the scene when he takes Michael to work and talks aside to one of his employees... Kind of terrifying.It's also super funny in a way that's of understated. It was really nice to see Ryder, Aramis and Nico all together like in The Fader Summer of 17' mini series. They have great chemistry.The film is huge achievement and I think that Mikey has the same aura that Miyazaki had. It's like, whenever you watch a Studio Ghibli film and everything just makes sense and comes together. By the end of NOHO, the film had that same feeling. That everything the characters go through, and all the paths they end up on, are valid. Mikey does such an amazing job of conveying this and it's definitely going to be my new comfort film...","9","franpepperrell"," Mikey is so cool

"1446","I just finished watched about five minutes ago and I have never felt more inspired.The soundtrack, the shots, the plot. All of it. North Hollywood is beautifully and meticulously crafted. It radiates an aura of youthfulness and playfulness, yet immense passion and expertise that I think captures the essence of modern skate culture perfectly. This film is not only an interesting an intimate lens into skate culture, but a relatable story for young people pursuing what they love.At the end of the online premiere I just attended, the chat space with other viewers was full of people talking about how they felt inspired and wished each other the best for the rest of their life. Not only does this highlight the community and relatability (between especially young people) that was created through this film, I feel as though it evokes the impact North Hollywood intended to have on every single audience member to inspire individuals who can inspire more. North Hollywood is a film by the first teen movie studio that has inspired me to get my act together and work for what I want and motivate others to do the same. I'm gonna be big one day and this just pushed me one step further. Giving y'all a nine because we can only go up. IC 4L. Bravo.","9","ellapark-93530"," INSPIRING.
"
"1447","Firstly, congrats to Mikey and the IC team for finally releasing a truly amazing film. This movie is unique in characters, storyline, and cinematography. It really is a beautiful piece.The actors chosen for each role were arguably perfect. There were a few big celebrities such as Vince Vaughn and Miranda Cosgrove, but most of the people acting in this movie are a part of IC. Keeping it close to home creates a comfortable feeling, while still going big with the known actors.The storyline was less perfect, but definitely still worth watching. There were some moments that you can't help but smile at because it reminds you of your own memories. There was even a scene where I cried- it hit home for me in many ways. Which goes back to relatability. This movie is very much relatable. Every kid who skates thinks about going pro at least once. And many try their luck later on. There is coming of age, drama, and comedy; very versatile and interesting.The best part of the film (for me) by far are the pictures. This movie is produced extremely well. The love that the crew put into this film is seen very well throughout the entire piece. From the clean skate shots to the stunning close up scenes, NoHo does not falter in the category of cinematography. The video style can definitely be described as indy, while still incorporating bigger concepts to move the film along nicely.Overall, this film is well written and beautifully executed. Like others have said, it is bound to become a sleepover-classic and many people's favorite movie. It certainly wasn't what I was expecting, in the best way possible. A perfectly pleasant surprise. So thank you again, Mikey and the IC team, for putting together such an amazing movie that I will definitely watch over and over again. I recommend this to anyone and everyone, no matter if you skate or not.","10","tsunnye"," NoHo is an unmatched experience
"
"1448","Easily my favourite film of the year so far, has a perfect balance of humour, drama, heart-touching scenes and an aesthetic that shines throughout the entire movie. The soundtrack is unreal, and you can sense Mikey's Scorsese influence which he mentioned in a previous IC video. The cinematography is stellar and perfectly captures the tone of the scenes. No spoilers but one scene hit so close to home that it made me tear up. A love letter to North Hollywood, the LA skate scene and skateboarding in general, and filmmaking. A must watch for any aspiring skateboarders or filmmakers, or anyone with doubts about pursuing their dream.MORE MIKEY MORE

"
"1453","I think to truly enjoy this film you have to go into it knowing what it is. From the announcement, to the preview at Camp Flog Gnaw, to the videos and Instagram posts explaining NoHo journey, the build up and hype makes it that much better. Now for the actual film, it was very well shot, with effortless and flowing transitions, Mikey and his team did a phenomenal job on the presentation and boring work to make this film look good.Also, the sets and costumes in this movie and bright and vibrant with the exception of a couple scenes. These choices really help set the mood. Another strong feature is the soundtrack (perhaps its strongest), the ability to have The Chiffons and Baby Keem, fit in the same movie is really a testament to the diversity and range of the film. The story speaks for itself in my opinion. It shows the strains achieving your goals can have on your relationships. This is also one of the only movies that accurately portrays the skateboarding industry, possibly the only one. Moving on to the characters, I enjoy the development of Mikey (Ryder McLaughlin); how he starts off as a likable kid, but by the middle he almost annoys you, because you're hoping he'll realizing he's acting like a jerk but he doesn't. Then in the end Mikey finally redeems himself and wins back the audience. Oliver (Vince Vaughn) Mikey's dad, accurately portrays the attitude of parents towards their children, when they aren't going down the path they had mapped out for them. Every scene Oliver was in was great and Vince was perfect for this role. Adolf (Aramis Hudson) was probably my favorite character, I really respected his loyalty. Rachel (Miranda Cosgrove), was one of the weaker characters in my opinion, her dialogue seemed lacking and awkward at points, maybe Mikey intended for this to be the case, to in a way draw the line of main and side character. There are more great cameos by Nico Hiraga, Angus Cloud, Thomas Barbusca, Blake Anderson, Tyshawn Jones, and probably my favorite besides Adolf, Jason Dill as a priest. While I feel like this movie had strong, and relatable characters I do feel like at times the dialogue could have been enriched with more emotion. But, then again this is a minor issue that to most viewers will be overlooked. Overall North Hollywood was a spectacular film that I along with many others will be able to enjoy forever and will look back on it as a classic of our generation. I can't wait to see what Mikey and Illegal Civ have planned next.","10","lukebrecken"," Works extremely well for what it was

"1458","OK, it's clear that somebody has mobilised a social media following to give North Hollywood 10/10 reviews, but after watching the film I'd actually say that score is not far from the reality.The film looks stunning from start to finish and the performances are surprisingly solid across the board. Special merit has to go to Vince Vaughn, who once again demonstrates he's become one of the finest actors of his generation.Thoroughly enjoyed this film, it really is a joy to watch, and probably the best praise I can give it is that I was actually quite upset when it ended.

"1470","As a teenager today I could really empathize with Michaels struggles of friendship, love, and passion. I felt his pain and anxiety throughout the whole movie but at the same time could see both sides of the argument between his friends and family. Not only that but a lot of the things Micheal experienced I somewhat experienced myself, the troubles of having a girlfriend and a best friend at the same time, having your family want you to do something you didn't wanna do and drifting away from close friends. Near the end when Micheal and Adolf made up and hugged I teared up a bit because something exactly the same happened to me once but me and my past friend never made up so it really made me think of him and how we both should have changed and learned and grew together. I also could feel Michaels passion to be cool and hangout with pros and having a friend who is just a loser, again I went through the same thing. I could really tell that the people making this movie understood being a skater and being a teenager and how tough it is. I also thought that the actor was superb, Vince Vaughn and the lead cast did incredible in their roles and I could feel the tension while watching. The only critiques I really have are from a director stand point like how some of the scenes are a little misplaced or filmed funny. In all I loved this movie and have already watched it twice today. I recommend it to anyone who is or once was a skater in their teen years.","9","jackbowman-62862"," Really hit home for me!

This film holds a special place in my heart because y'all made it together and on your own, you guys did it with people that you love. Ryder played his part very good and i think that it was important for him to stick up to his dad and do what he loves (because many people find that hard to do) I couldn't have asked for a better cast, so thank you guys for picking who you did!! This movie is going to teach a lot of younger people to stand up for what they believe in, and to go after anything they dream. Skating is big for many people and it's hard to keep a steady mind when ur trying to make yourself known! I loved this movie, just wish it was longer.

"1503","Operation JavaWhat's happening in Mollywood ? Like seriously? Can't believe all this top class versatile movies are happening in one shot. Pretty much they have already compensated well for the loss of 2020. Vellam, Love, Drishyam 2 and now operation Java? Operation JavaIt's the first movie with MULTIPLE-REAL LIFE -CYBER CRIME inspired thriller stories in a SINGLE movie. Since the movie 'love' and this still hasn't got much attention, even after getting a 4/5 from I. E. I wanna draw your attention to these highlights. The movie has even included premam pirate leak, tamil rockers and much moreNow a few people out there, when they get bored with one portion, says the movie is lagging. Well, that's their choice. But for me, that's the calmness before the stormThis movie also has such a phase, where the director dives into defining the personal lives of the characters, so that they can connect better to us. And that's just the director leaving his foot off the clutch, to give full throttle to the movie. Jakes Bejoy's killer bgm plays..Since this movie is inspired from real events, it's also shot as a NATURAL THRILLER (one of its kind) and not as a CINEMATIC THRILLER like drishyam-2. And most importantly,
I'm soo much satisfied with the movies which doesn't have popular stars, cz they would draw most of the attention. Which is why movies like this, can connect you directly to the story/characters. I do recommend this movie to be watched in big screen for the full experience. -D. R. Adinath.","9","adinathdr"," Multiple-real-life-cybercrime inspired-thriller stories in one movie

"1505","There is never a dull moment in this movie, except for maybe that one song sequence. This manages to make us feel convinced that this is how cyber police in Kerala works. We don't feel like any tech stuff they show is out of place. That is all one needs to ask from such a movie. When most movies show tech stuff in an incorrect way, this is breath of fresh air. It feels grounded in reality.At times it resembled Action Hero Biju. They have stitched together the investigation of several unrelated cyber crime cases in a seamless manner. It's told through the eyes of the two heroes. The story progresses through their viewpoint.The script doesn't lag anywhere. The comic relief we get is not at all forced and feels very organic.The acting is very good. There is no one who did their part in a bad way.The art, costumes, editing departments too did a commendable job.The only problem I found was that there was a bit too much of melodrama in it. The heroes always seem like they are not at all happy about what they got.If you want to watch an entertaining film which doesn't have any dull moment in it, go for this.","7","pm_unnikrishnan"," Keeps us fully engaged.

"1506","Even before its release, the film made a huge splash with trailers, teasers in YouTube!The film tells the story of Anthony George and Vinayak Das, who go from Salem to become courier boys and food delivery boys without getting a permanent job after engineering.Balu Varghese and Lukman Avaran are the B Tech cyber youngsters in the lead role. Lukman takes the field to another level with his eloquence in a crucial scene that presents an emotional storyline through dialogue.But the film does not revolve around them, it goes completely through the script and the making.The film begins with Alphonse's son's 'Premam' becoming a huge success and its censor copy being leaked on the internet.Antony and Vinayak Das are approaching SHO Prathap of the Cyber Wing in Kochi with the conclusion that the route found by the police is not behind it.The first part of Java is that the inspector, impressed by these guys ability, conducts the investigation the way they say.The film falls on track from the very first frame as it is an investigation of an incident that is familiar and interesting to the Malayalee.Gathering the audience as well. Java can be used from the beginning to create the impression that it can do justice to the hype received onlineRealistic and smart cyber police operations make the film worthwhile.The director manages to keep the audience curious throughout the operation. Nowhere does it seem like the work of a newcomer, says Tarun Murthy.Scripting Excellent. Making it's a step ahead.You can feel the exact homework behind it on the screen.Operation Java is another film in which a talented director emphasizes that, actors are not an essential element.As mentioned earlier, it is not the path of these two that is advancing in the investigative paths of cyber policing.Irshad has the full versatility of a cyber-wing station head. Binu Pappu and Prashant Alexander performed well.Operation Java came to an unexpected end.The compulsion to be realistic keeps the dramatic expectations of the traditional audience at bay.The film ends with the submission of millions of temporary / contract basic / daily wage employees in the Kingdom of India.A dedication that hooks somewhere inside.","7","sudheeshthulaseedharan"," Scripting Excellent.

"1510","Inspired from cases that were reported under the Cyber Cell department throughout the country, Operation Java opens several investigation files, fictionizes it, and takes us through these cases from the point of view of Antony and Dasan. Striving to make a living through casual jobs, Antony and Dasan dream of making it big someday, but they just don't make it to the shore. To the duo, clinging on to the 'lead' they had found in an interesting case is their only ""escape from reality"". The Director focuses on two issues here; cyber-crime and unemployment and brings about an equal balance in both core elements. While the subjects of cyber-crimes reveal how frightening and cunning certain Humans can be, the light that falls on Antony and Dasan and their lives make you empathetic and feel pity for them. I felt the first act of the screenplay to be the most interesting and entertaining, whereas better casting and a proper ending would've uplifted 'Operation Angel'. Also, with most of the shots being single takes, as an audience, you feel as if you are one among the group of officers, which is a huge plus point in keeping the audience engaged, and to add to this engagement, there is beaty music from Jakes Bejoy kicking it up a notch. There have been plenty of movies and TV shows that dealt with financial frauds, scams, and cyber-crimes. Operation Java is a mix of these movies and TV shows with a 'home ground' script, and by home ground, what I meant is how much the language audience can relate to. Malayalam cinema yet again proves that it does not need big names on the poster to attract the audience, content is always king in this industry.","7","sreenesh-g-one"," Operation Java: Successful

The lead is supposed to have 56,000 hours of flight time which is also ridiculous, showing me how bad the writers actually are.
56,000 hours is 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, for over 6 YEARS...In the end, it is a silly implausible movie that you will forget moments after you watch it.Not Recommended.","4","Athanatos173"," Silly Movie

Logic is nonsensical, where people walking and people driving a car very fast are reaching the same destination at the same time(and they both left the same time).
Plot is early James Bond level of over the top.
Editing is patched together so loosely that you barely realize what is going on

"1542","This movie made no sense and had so many plot holes and stupid moments.Where to begin?
A 19 yr old Lieutenant who claims he has 56,000 hours flight experience (work it out), disobeys a direct order so gets sent on a secret mission retaining his rank. A robot in the form of a man who can withstand direct shots to the chest with armour piercing rounds no problem but complains it hurts when a tracker is cut out of his back. Can reason, make cynical jokes and make decisions (really need to think how that isn't a good thing). When you run out of ammo, throw away your very expensive US military issue auto gun despite standing next to the jeep you arrived in.
Apparently auto makers lost the ability to further designs after 2020.

"
"1543","Probably not something you're going to re-watch but for me it was enjoyable.If you want something new this may not be the right choice, the general story is pretty standard:
Newbie gets to the camp, meets more experienced mentor, experiences combat, handles it badly for a while, twist, he ends up on his own and somehow completes the mission.There are some cool parts to the story though. Most notably for me was the parallel between Leo and the standard combat drones.
He more or less wants the US to consider the consequences to their new weapon systems, that's why he does what he does. You can see it throughout the movie including the collateral damage from drone strikes, but more interesting is the fact that their combat robots have a tendency to fire first.
Sure their targets are armed and behaving in a threatening manner. But as demonstrated by Leo defusing the situation by the relief truck it doesn't have to end with a firefight.There's also an interesting parallel between them sending a drone pilot to experience combat in order to understand what happens when they fire a missile and the US learning the consequences of their weapons by one of those weapons turning against them. That's why Leo *MUST* be the one to do it.All in all a solid film. But it does suffer from some boneheaded mistakes including: the protagonist having over 56000 flight hours, that's 6 years 24/7, or 18 years full time. As such I would expect him to be in his late thirties at least, but I don't think the character was more than 25...
The Balkans being mentioned frequently despite the movie taking place in Ukraine some 600 miles and several countries away. And sure that one can be handwaved away, most of the time they are referring to a person, ""the terror of the Balkans"" and therefore not technically wrong. But throughout the movie it seems like they are referring to that title as if it has local significance...","7","daniel-nordqvist-eqe08"," Decent Single A Action movie

"1544","Another year, another Netflix action film is here to watch, this time it is Outside The Wire and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a drone pilot have to team up with android officer in an attempt to save the world.Main Character
Anthony Mackie plays Leo the android who I thought did a good job here and bought quite a bit to the role. He is basically the tough mentor and he does it pretty effectively, his character goes all over the place in the final act and it comes close to ruining it but it doesn't take away from his decent performance. But there is another main character Harp played by Damson Idris and I did not like this character at all. He does something at the beginning of the film that makes him unlikeable from the start and he never recovered for me and I never came around to care about him.Supporting Characters
The supporting cast don't offer anything because the film doesn't try to make that happen. The bad guy is as generic and dull as you can imagine and everybody else in the film is barely here and they aren't given anything to really work with. The film only really cares about its too main protagonists and forsakes every other character here.Story
The story is serviceable at best, I like the fact that Mackie's character was an android and how this world uses synthetics in general was pretty interesting and could have and should have been explored more. The film just doesn't do a good enough job of exploring it's themes and messages and the final act is so ridiculous and basically feels like it comes out of nowhere in order for the film to try and feel unique. Also the ending feels very abrupt, I don't know why lately it feels like films I watch are ending abruptly and this one is no different not answering all the questions it needs to.Script
The script is fine, Mackie spits out some pretty good dialogue and the story does have a few good elements. Though like its story the script falls very short and tries to be more interesting then it is and it could have done with either focusing more on the interesting parts or just be a full on action film.Style
The style of the film has some pretty decent action scenes that do show the horror of war. But the film doesn't do enough with what it has, probably because there wasn't the budget that the film really needed for something so ambitious.Overall
Overall, this is a below average action film that doesn't do anything to change up the game and really make it stand out and is one you can happily skip.","4","alindsay-al"," A Below Average Action Film

AI bot out smarts its makers and decide to go rogue and start Armageddon and its upto the drone pilot rookie to stop him , yawn.Mech war between American and Russian combat robots called gumps in a downtown street.

"1551","Being trashed in some reviews but hard to see why. Decent concept, the robots and drone warfare ""look"" right. CGI is fine. Mackie fighting his way through the Krasny's is very Wick-Ian. There is some important dialogue between the two main characters that is important for the ending. And that's where the problem may be, as the Captain Leo Android makes some conclusions and decisions that would not be totally popular in the US. A brave script in that respect, and a good thriller.","8","polsixe"," Why the Hate? Good Flick

"1554","Or just ... plain wired? Now visually and technically in general I'd say there is not much one can critisize here. On the story part though ... or at least the coherent storytelling ... that's a different story (no pun intended). This really is quite a stretch to say the least. And while Mackie does his best to keep the audience engaged (together with the rest of the cast, but I'd argue he's best ... equipped - again with the puns I know) ... unfortunately I'd say he is ... programmed to fail! Ok I'll stop, but I just couldn't help myself.So if you want to just shut off and enjoy some action on your screen, you could do worse. But I hear many already saying ""why a 7? Why rate it so high?"". Well the answer to that is, that I was entertained and not bothered too much by the flaws the movie. I understand if you feel otherwise.

I appreciate we're close to war machines but unless you all know more than me they don't exist yet therefore this is sci-fi.

"1556","You are basically getting a really good action flick with great gun fighting and military robot scenes and fight scenes. It has some great actors too (shout out to Doug from House of Cards). Yeah, the script can get a little basic and you can ask ""why didn't they just kill him like this"", but then you're expecting too much.

"1562","This wasn't a bad movie; decent amount of action, what little CGI was used was believable, it worked. This movie was a cross between Training Day and Terminator. There are a lot of similarities between the three movies.

"1564","This is an unscrupulous attempt to combine Training Day with something like Monsters of Man (or any other mediocre recent robot related CGI laden money grab).And it was a perfect job. The movie pushes all the buttons, does everything that was in both genres of movies, but without any feeling. Ironically, it felt like a machine created the script - when I know for a fact that if a machine did it it would have been more creative.Bottom line: you may enjoy it, but it doesn't bring anything new and it's pretty boring.","6","siderite"," By the numbers movie, well acted, but not very entertaining

"1567","While not an entirely original premise (there is a very good French TV show called ""Almost Human"" a few years ago about a cop with a robot partner that explored similar concepts) the main idea of the movie had real promise. It was also interesting that they made the android character much smarter and 'human' than we usually see in these sorts of stories, there are no scenes where the android misunderstands human interactions, if anything, the AI is better able to read human motivations and behaviors than the human characters.However, the movie fizzles as it goes on. It is hard to know how it really goes wrong. The big reveal is interesting. The characters learn and change over the course of the movie. The setting is interesting. There aren't many 'stupid decisions' by characters (I hate movies that make smart characters suddenly stupid to move the story on). But, in the end, our impression was ""meh... it was okay.'","unknown_value_please_contact_support","keithsealy"," Started strong, but in the end it is just okay

"1568","Everyone wants to be Ebert and Siskel clearly. I stopped reading reviews and watched this just now and i will say the first 20 minutes had me concerned but then it performed very well with the intro of Leo. If I would have listened to all the negative reviews, i would have missed out on a good movie.Those that say it was predictable I call BS. Those bashing the performance or plot, well to each his or her own . I guess they were expecting an extension of the Terminator. I liked the cast line up and the acting. Was good to see Anthony Mackie up front and center again.You wont have any idea what the endgame is until 3/4 of the way through the movie. The bigger issue it addresses is real-time on both AI and our hubris in thinking that we can control its evolution. It calls to light our humanity and the ills that we do coming back at us. Also, the aspect of war from the comfort of home with this generation and its love for video games and how that translates to the removal from the real life consequences of pressing a button thousands of miles away first pulling a trigger with boots on the ground in combat is yet another real-time issue.I would have given it a ten but the ending did fall short of the build up. But that's just how I felt.","9","getphysicallyfit"," Give it a watch and rate for yourself.

"1569","Half decent entertaining film until the ending which for a second I thought maybe a brave one and won't be the predictable usual By The Book standard script but unfortunately that's exactly what I got, in the end Netflix chickened out.Guess what yet again the American Hero saves the day for America and apparently for the whole world!!

"
"1571","I watched this film and thought it was pretty good, so I was surprised to see so many negative reviews floating about. Yeah sure it's not Oscar winning or anything outstanding, but it's a typical action film that ticks the boxes for said genre.It's a watchable plot with a pretty decent twist towards the end, which was nicely unexpected. The acting was okay as was the camera work etc. But yeah, I mean it's a pretty bog standard action film with guns, explosions and fighting. what more do you want with an action film?
The actual machines I thought played a minor part of the film and if like me you aren't keen on sci-fi you'll be fine. Of course this could reverse and if you like sci-fi you might be disappointed by the lack of it...Negatively I will say that the main character isn't exactly likeable and I wasn't too convinced on his characteristics. One minute he's scared, next he's brave then he isn't again. Make up your mind mate.Overall though it ain't bad. It's a plot that won't challenge you and if you like action just whack it on and see. It won't blow your socks off, but it isn't naff either. I think people have got into the habit of just slating Netflix films for the sake of it.","7","danielmanson"," Actually not bad

There's some bits that make you think, but there's still action, there's unbelievable bits, but it's okay, it's in the future!

A lot of the ratings say that it was a dry and bad script, and yeah it wasn't the best, but I definitely enjoyed some of the conversations and funny lines.

"1585","Maybe it doesn't have the best action scene or storyline or with a happy ending we're so used. This movie however tells us something else, something important that most people can't see. The movie brings up subjects with moral thinking that we face today and may face in the future if we don't start to acknowledge the world around us. Like the headline tells us, ""In a near future..."". The reality of this movie is not far from where we stand today and we don't even realize. This movie brings up several controversial subjects and does it with great precision that most of us doesn't even realize. The people who really appreciate a good meaningful movie are going to understand this film. See the bigger picture folks.","8","tobiaswallentinsson"," See the bigger picture

"1586","The film does not deserve this low rating. There are some great ideas that this movie is exploring. It is not a propaganda movie for sure. And it is neither a typical military American movie. I do not want to spoil but it can certainly open your mind to new perspectives on the so much used theme about the conflict between the wickedness of the human nature and the idealism of AI. If you read bad reviews before, you will be influenced. I recommend you don't. Maybe they did not choose the best way to tell the story but it is a good story. Aaaa, and good action.","8","robertamanuela"," It is a good movie that it is underrated

Nothing makes sense so you think ok, let's just enjoy the action. Some of it works, like the robot warriors (go Chappie!), but some of it is just pointless. The movie really starts to spiral at the end as you are expected to believe the fate of world hangs on the shoulders of this failed drone pilot...yes, the script is absolutely horrible, but so many other things are generic and bland that nobody gets a pass.","4","lasse-454-855039"," Training day but stupid.

It is still worth the time to view it.The film's anti drone, anti AI, and sometimes anti American (it seems to blame the US for everything IMHO) is not screamed in the viewer's face, but it is noticeably there.Watch it and enjoy the action and the message given in the end, ignoring what you need to.","8","daveerrn"," Well Worth A Watch

"1599","I may not be much of a tech head, but the very concept of a human being acting like an AI robot that is human-like to the point of hiding in plain sight is a tough role to pull off, and it worked. Not only that, but to see the dynamic between the two of them - the push and pull - was entertaining by itself. It was a good action movie with more philosophical points than average. Maybe there were some points of authenticity that need clarifying, but overall it was a great action movie that addressed issues and made one think in a way that most don't bother to get into. And it was nice to see POC in a movie that was about a developed story/characters, and not just giving a platform to more Black trauma.","8","writeztuff"," Futuristic

In most movies, one often hates the bad guy and totally agrees with the hero. It takes a good plot to make you like and dislike not only the hero and villain but also all the factions fighting in this movie.

"1601","Not a great movie by any means but it's better than the extremely negative like / dislike reviews make it out to be. The twists can be seen from a mile away but the mentality of the antagonist at the end is an interesting twist on the typical doomsday AI scenario. In all I felt as though there was just too much crammed into two hours and didn't allow for proper character development and relied on too many cliches to carry the story. This story would have been better told in a two season mini series.

"1602","The script is bad, the storyline is flat - there's one single story arc. But the theme is compelling, the acting is better than you'd expect and the CGI is actually top-tier quality. Don't expect an award-winning movie experience, but the 90-ish minutes of your life it takes to see it is a pretty good investment: Humanity will eventually reach the singularity - AI being smarter than humans, that is.

"1612","It's not a bad movie, but after watching it, you just can't shake off the feeling that you felt almost nothing. The story is fine, in fact it's a very good story. Maybe if I've read it I would have been more excited about it. I definitely think the filmmakers should have taken more care of the details and the substance and try to surprise us a little more, it felt a bit bland at times. I wouldn't say it's a miss since it's a pretty good effort, the cg is on point, the acting is so-so+, the sound design/orchestration is forgettable but does not fail at doing it's job, and the plot seemed coherent. My big + is the depiction of the upcoming robot wars, that seemed very realistic, well thought and most certainly an accurate preview of our future.","7","nicolasmaczk"," I'd give it a 6.5

Really bad ending, no plot development just over dramatic action scenes that lead up to nothing.This move has some notable features such as the action scenes, the good acting skills from both Damson Idris(DI) and Antony Mackie (AM)however what it lacks is a good plot and story development. The story ages like milk instead of wine!The change of sides from Captain Leo(AM) was not well explained, and did not make sense to the story. The ending was even more far fetched us there was no real suspense, only an outcome we the audience know was going to happen.The story feels rushed, and the characters are not developed well enough.Watch: When there is no other option.","4","Shaunk-65"," No development of the plot and characters WHATSOEVER!
"
"1614","So we all want different things in a movie, right? Acting, directing, plot, message, fear, thrills, ... I won't say this movie has all of that. It certainly doesn't. I can see from the other ratings that many viewers were dissatisfied. They want every movie to be an all-time classic, maybe. The acting is not particularly notable in Outside the Wire, but it worked. Anthony Mackie (Captain Leo) does it right ... a believable android and superhero type. Almost a cliche, but with some refreshing twists. Damson Idris (Harp) seemed a little flat, but it was part of his character ... and I found his character likable. You can identify with this guy when he is stricken by the horrors of war. He turns out to be a great Everyman, struggling with impossible choices, trying to do the right thing, forcing himself to go on when he wants to flee. The resistance leader -- not sure of her name -- was great. Such a contrast from expectations!The whole movie was full of surprises like that. I thought it was going to be a problem, all the PC angle and stuff, but they managed to hit the right tone. Even the setting lent itself to that. These are not the conventionalized faces of a civilian population struggling to live in a war zone. It is not Vietnam or the Middle East or a South American drug war, or Somalia. This is Europe. It brings to mind images of World War 2. It is like Kosovo on steroids. The bad guys are your stereotyped Russians, or Russian Ukrainians, kind of like what we might think of as Chechens or something. But they do make for excellent bad guys, with a few interesting twists. They are slightly more humanized than some movies I have seen. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.I thought the portrayal of the US military would annoy me to the point where it brought down the whole movie. It was kind of annoying on some levels. Hollywood (and Netflix, I guess) love to show the military as a bunch of low brow grunts, and it bugs me because I know they are professionals. Leadership is outstanding. So the way they treat this drone pilot is utterly unbelievable ... totally fictionalized and cliched. But I got over that. Just accept it as part of the plot. And they redeem themselves by showing that the US is at least trying to do the right thing. Still, I had problems with the portrayal of drone strikes as these things causing massive civilian casualties. Which brings to mind the thing that I found most unbelievable in the movie: those missile explosions are absolutely ridiculous! What are they, Hellfires or something? A Hellfire can take out a car in traffic and leave adjacent cars almost drivable. Or are they something bigger? No matter, the explosions looked bigger than a 2000 pound bomb. Oh well, part of the thrill!This movie will be enjoyed by people who like military tech movies. The Gumps are absolute fun! I might just go back and watch those many robot scenes again. I love the Boston Dynamics feel to it, the robot dogs mixing in with the soldiers and all that. Battles between robots with humans caught in the crossfire ... that's worth a rating point right there! And man, there are some horrific combat scenes, up close and personal! Maybe not totally realistic, and yes, our protagonist survives things against the odds ... repeatedly ... but still, these scenes are well done and thrilling. You may want to wear your combat goggles for this one, with all the flying concrete chips and stuff.And, saving the best for last, Captain Leo. Captain Leo! Holy smokes! I forgot he was an android, and the scene where he revealed his true nature was definitely a shocker! I haven't seen a robot quite like him in a movie. They took it beyond Terminator. A robot that (maybe?) feels pain, emotion, and compassion. I never could figure whether delivering vaccines was important to him or just a cover, and how real his emotions were. He was definitely your archetype of a complicated character. In the end you can even believe he was tormented, despite his tough exterior. I guess that fits the superhero meme. But what a superhero! Harp knows he is getting close by the trail of bodies. The shootout when Captain Leo gets Viktor Koval is utter, over the top ridiculous pandemonium, and fun as hell. Later, when you see that he really is mortal, you can appreciate what he did there. Here are the real spoilers: was he really a Frankenstein monster trying to destroy his maker because he knew the dangers of his kind? See, that's pretty intense. They did it well. And allowing his destroyer (Harp) to survive, instead of killing him like he kills everyone else is the classic thing we have seen countless times, but I embrace this particular trope. I like to see how different movies do it. It reminds me of the Colonel in Apocalypse Now, setting up his own sacrifice. And what an end!This movie is fast, fun, and satisfying. I didn't think I would rate it this highly until the end, and I didn't think I would watch it again until now, thinking back on it. I probably will.","9","rharrisstoertz"," Fast, fun, and satisfying ... More to it than first meets the eye

"1615","If this had been made 30 years ago it would have blown people away, fact.
The ethical questions raised about the use of automated warfare are pretty relevant at the moment as several world powers race to produce robot armies, air forces and naval power. Not to cut casualties, but to make the fighting 'more efficient'. Who doesn't want a robot that never sleeps and kills without hesitation?
The ultimate goal of 'The Bad Guy' is to make humanity question its use of robots in war, and maybe not do it anymore? But of course the humans win, how could they not? This is a film made by humans.
Liberally dosed with some outstanding shootee action, many life or death situations, and several twists to keep you guessing, this was like an ethics lecture performed via a PS4 session playing 'Modern Warfare'.
Highly recommended for anyone with a brain or love of action films. Arms designers and generals should be prevented from watching this, they'll only get bad ideas.","8","lewilewis1997"," I Wanted The 'Bad Guy' To Win...

I really was rooting for the AI, unfortunately. The young guy's character was, I guess, supposed to be holier-than-thou and naive, sometimes pretty darned annoying. I feel that he reaches the wrong conclusion. I am not a war-monger or anti-anything - I feel that the AI's desire could be somehow achieved, not so much the kid's. How it might be achieved, other than what the AI was attempting, would be the subject for future movies :)

It had me from engaged from beginning to end and the actors did a great job. You have war films, and you have films about AI but I think this may be the closest or the most you are going to get when you marry a good modern war film mixed with futuristic technology (AI) without it coming off as cheesy or ridiculous. It is very realistic in a sense when you consider Tech & Warfare. With the heightened concern about the tensions between the modern day superpowers of the world (US and Russia), the groups that try to resist their ideologies over the many years and how it affects those that innocently live or try to survive in between their influences or advancements; this film touches a nerve. Plenty of action, its rugged, and many can relate in some way about its philosophy because we all have that 'What if..?feeling in the back of our minds and I think this film delivers a good plausible answer to the main question.","9","djklymaxx-05604"," Good Film, Watch It & Ignore the Negative Reviews

"1633","The year is 2036. America is trying to keep the peace in Eastern Europe especially Ukraine. In addition to aerial drones, the military is also using robotic soldiers called Gumps. Drone pilot Harp (Damson Idris) disobeys order and fires a missile close to the troupes killing two American soldiers. For his reprimand, he is reassigned to follow Captain Leo (Anthony Mackie) on an out-of-the-box ground mission to track down pro-Russian terrorist leader Victor Koval who aims to start a nuclear war.Ukraine doesn't have nukes. Even with the most outrageous conspiracy theory, nobody ever accuses Ukraine of having nukes. It doesn't make political sense. Russia wouldn't let them. The west would disown them. They had to decommission all their nukes before being allowed into the European economic system. I lay this down as my first point because it's indicative of the entire movie. This is trying to be a near future reality. It wants to be realistic. It's not. That gets annoying after awhile. Even with the food truck standoff, non of the combatants are taking cover. Everybody is standing out in the open and nobody is keeping an eye on the high ground. Once I realized that this is a dumb action movie, it does have its fun but the movie keeps thinking that it's smarter than it is. I love the Asimov conundrum being injected but it just reminds me that there is a smart script somewhere in here. It's smart one minute but gets dumb in the next. I also don't like the Gumps. Somebody would realize that it's useful for some Gumps to pack a bigger punch. They would at least have grenade launchers.","4","SnoopyStyle"," This movie thinks that it's smarter than it is

"1637","LIKES:Moves well for most of the movie
Good Acting
Some Character Development In a war movie
Moralizing In a War Movie
Decent CGI
The Action At Times ExcitingDISLIKES:
Dialogue a Bit bland
Script A Bit Plain/Lack of Twists
Some Outside Logical Moments
The Lazy Writing with cursing
Involvement of Other characters are Okay
The Ending Loses Itself And Become Hastily FinishedSUMMARY:After a few opening titles to explain what is going on, Outside the Wire hits the ground with a literal bang as war opens up in a decent shoot out of military might. That pace keeps going for much of the movie, and takes little time to hit the brakes as Mackie and his partner jump into the complex Russian war frontier. Amidst the theater of war, these two soldiers manage to bring some character development into the typical solider war, gradually expanding on what goes on in their processors, while also integrating some personal morals that foreshadow what is to come. Certainly not as good as some other battle films, these two still have some more layered levels to their typical soldier titles. To help bring out all the feels of the moment, the two actors deserve props for bringing their skills to good levels, with Mackie taking charge of the front. Part Falcon meets part Triple 7 in regards to performances of the past, Mackie's stalwart stoic nature makes him perfect for the rugged soldier who is like no other. Meanwhile Cilenti acts a different route, a sort of analyzing compass who phases through the spectrum of emotions that serve as the medium to help give a little more to the action phase of the movie, aka morale investigation of war. Like many things in the modern era, Outside the Wire is not about entertaining, but having some political assessments baked into the movie in order to go with the modern audiences needs. Not as bad for most of the movie, the morals do a good job of showing the grey zone of war to make it engaging, relevant, and a particular plot point that again stays relevant for yours truly. This layered approach may help bring more people in and at least the first hour does not interrupt the action too much. In regards to the action, the movie has some very exciting moments, finally reaching the levels that movies in the theaters were able to achieve for me. Gun play, some close quarters combat, some engaging fights where you have no idea which good or bad people will make it are all this film. By far my favorite and perhaps strongest aspect of the film were these moments and though not the most dynamic or choreographed, many of the fights fit with the theme of the movie and keep things exciting amidst the more dialogue heavy moments, while also pushing the characters to new limits. CGI levels are not too bad either, with robots, stunts, and special effects nicely balanced to make a believable moment, without going into Michael Bay style levels of overdoing it.As for the dislikes, it starts with the dialogue of the film. Unlike some of the better war movies, Netflix did not invest a lot into the script balance for cleverness, motivational, or even emotional dialogue to be remembered. While the jargon fills at place, there are times that some more engaging words were needed to spice things up and make for memorable moments, especially during the character building moments. The same goes for the writing as the script gradually focuses more on the ethics of war, that the storytelling elements starts to be diluted as well. Lack of twists, some downgraded story elements, and many areas that start to lose logic and sense sadly take away from the potential build up that they wanted. In addition, the writing also gets lazy when the cursing comes into the fray, again losing the potential for some amazing writing instead of just crude commentary. The use of secondary characters is half decent as well, trying to incorporate several members of various factions into the mix to show the complexity of war. And yet, I still feel there was not a full engagement of some of these characters given all the profiling they did. The main leader of the revolutionary army, the military directors who have a beef with the characters, even the contact all felt kind of squashed in, involved at only segments of the movie rather than throughout making them feel sort of cheap. Again, better than many movies I've seen, Outside the Wire still had room to improve on all the characters being integrated and developed in this odd tale. Yet the biggest thing that takes away from me though is ironically the moral investigation at the end of the film. At one point balanced, by the end the movie decides to leap off the entertainment pathway and go more towards questioning the way of the world. Important? Absolutely, but at the same time the director dropped the ball for me as the tale's twist became much more of a philosophy text book then the engaging tale it started out as. An anti-climactic chase and fight at the end really showed this off, and though deeper than a typical action film, still held much more potential to be something greater if they had kept to the path they started that could have delivered both moral filled lessons and still been super engaging.The VERDICT:Overall, Outside the Wire fulfills the role of war quite well with a science fiction element that was not over the top or farfetched. Good acting for the leading roles helps with making characters you stick with along this fast paced adventure and potential resonating with to stay through the nearly two hours of material. With moral themes and thought of warfare integrated with exciting action in many parts of the film, the movie delivers the action/thriller promise the trailers made. Yet, the movie sadly needs some tuning up in the dialogue and writing to not only make more memorable moments, but execute the twists much better and not defy the logic they were building for. Some character integration and mitigating the morals in the end would have really made the movie much more complete and potentially finishing with the same balance of story and action I loved at the beginning. Still, overall, not a bad film for a streaming hit and thus my scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 7.5

"1651","My recommendation: avoid spoilers like the plague and don't even read many reviews. This film is best experienced as a wild ride.I simply love how creative it was. Excellent filmmaking required to make a movie set 99% of the time in a cryogenic chamber riveting and suspenseful, though a huge amount of the credit for that goes to the lead actress. I've never seen her in anything before but she was simply phenomenal. Without her this could have gone a different way but if nothing else watch it for her performance.This is what sci-fi is meant to be: exploring how our current and future technologies affect the human condition. The details of the science itself are certainly fascinating but what it gets right is showing what that means for humanity as a whole AND the individual, and what it means for our future. I see that lacking in a lot of sci-fi and so it's always refreshing to see.I can understand where some of the negative reviews are coming from but in my (naturally subjective) opinion they simply don't outweigh the good and in many cases are wrong.

And we have a technology to build human clones and put all the original memories inside of them. Why on earth would you need to colonize a new planet then? You could just build a secure place on earth with lots of clones that will wake up after say 50 years of human extinction and live on the amazing planet that is still available, while the virus will be dead since all humans are dead (herd immunity also works when no hosts are alive anymore).

"1657","Oxygen might be Alexandre Aja's best movie to date.It's a one man show, or in this case, a one woman show, as Melanie Laurent delivers a performance worthy of praise as an amnesiac who awakens in a cryopod and tries to figure out how she got there and how she can escape with the help of the AI assisstant MILO. The movie's plot is reminiscent of Buried, starring Ryan Reynolds, only this time we're dealing with a high-concept idea that cannot be mentioned without spoiling the movie.What I liked the most about this movie is that throughout its entire runtime, it never once loses steam and is able to hold the attention of the viewer. Although it's set almost entirely in one location, the script always finds ingenious elements to keep the plot going and oftentimes it reaches that nail-biting tension the viewers expect from a sci-fi thriller like this.Melanie Laurent is entirely up to task and she carries this movie effortlessly. Her character's discoveries about her past, present and future offer moments that showcase her immense talent of making us care for a character that we, like the character itself, know nothing about.The direction from Alexandre Aja is never boring and he uses smart camera tricks to maintain tension and suspense. There's always a sense of engagement with the plot that Aja crafts masterfully, although some plot reveals are a little bit convenient and they come exactly when you expect them to.Overall, I thought Oxygen benefits from an inventive and well-written script, Aja's tight direction, and of course, Melanie Laurent's performance, who carries the entire movie on her shoulders.","7","ABCloverLane"," Tight, inventive script and a superb Melanie Laurent

There is nothing new in Oxygene, most of it rethreads old ground but as it's story unfolds it remains engaging from start to finished. This is greatly helped by Melanie Laurent's fantastic central performance. Pretty good story, lovely visuals and score and, as I said previously, a great central performance elevate what could have been mediocre fare to some decent sci-fi with a nice emotional payoff. Well worth your time.","7","Orlando_Gardner"," Very enjoyable with a great central performance

"1668","Brilliant concept and effort for a low budget. Realistic and logical behavior from the main lead, and the drama unfolds at a good pace. Considering we get to see some of what happens at the destination, I would have preferred to expand that into, for example, visuals of some destination habitations and others activities there. What is destination life like? More budget can afford more VFX I know, but just saying, this would've been the cherry on the cake !

"1669","I watched this with English dubbed audio so I have no idea how the french actor was. This movie was about an hour too long. As the description says, woman wakes up in a cryotube with no memory and dwindling O2.Just not much else to see here, no super clever deductions, little or no Sci-fi and no real idea why she's there. Then in about a 2 minute monologue towards the end they explain it all to you. Just really boring, it seems all these french Scifi films leave me feeling just blah about them.","3","dwaynemayo60"," Not much here

"1670","If you have a scientific mind, you'll get filled with rage watching this movie.The story:
Woman wakes up in a hermetically sealed high tech hospital bed pod thingy.She gets desperate.An AI tells her she has a small amount of oxygen and it's dwindling.She gets more desperate and tries to open the pod, but can't because she doesn't have administrative priviledges.She has foggy memory and tries to remember where she is, who she is, etc.Though the AI she gets in contact with the police.They seem to be lying to her.She finds out that they were definetly lying by replaying the call with enhanced audio.She talks to some mysterious woman who seems to want to help her.Mistery woman gives her the code to get administrative priviledges, but tells her she shouldn't open the pod, or she will die, and that she can prove it.She tells her to use the priviledges to change some settings and turn off artificial gravity.She does that and starts to float, and finds out she's in space.She learns that she is in a ship, and that if she opens the pod, she'll be in contact with the vaccum of space and will die.She finds out that humanity is about to die in 2 generations, so that she and others were sent to another planet to colonize it. And most of humanity doesn't know about this.But an asteroid hit the ship, and many died. This has also damaged her oxygen supply.And when she tried to call the cops, the ministry of defense interfered so that local cops didn't get to know about the secret and started lying to her.Then the mistery woman gets taken as well, and the pod woman has to figure the rest on her own, with the help of the AI. She figures out that she's a clone, and that the mysterious woman was her original on Earth.She also figures out a way that she can get into supended animation again, and survive until she gets reanimated in the new colony.The end.","1","mauriciofernandogerhardt"," Too many logic problems + deus ex machina moments

"1671","Frankly I don't think this movie is that bad.

""Oxygen"" has beautiful set design, solid acting and doesn't get boring. There's always this question ""why is this happening"" and one question leads to next. I actually enjoyed it more than Alexandre Aja's last movie ""Crawl"" (2019). Nothing special, but not bad either.","7","Movie_Fever"," Solid Movie

"1678","I watched this movie because it was new at the time on Netflix, and I had to review a current film for my podcast. I therefor went in relatively blind. This review might contain slight spoilers.The movie is about a woman that wakes up in a Futuristic medical pod. She has lost her memory and most uncover who she is and how to save herself before the medical pod runs out of oxygen.This is a Sci-fi mystery movie, and it carries both roles only half well. The Sci-fi aspect comes from the fact the main character is stuck in a futuristic medical pod that has a computer installed called M. I. L. O. The computer system is more or less just Seri that can google whatever the main character needs. M. I. L. O as a plot device was really clever implemented. Not only does it give us a character the main character can talk too, but the way he works also makes it entirely up to the main character to work out the mystery. When she puts two and two together, she now can make a better google search in order to uncover the truth. M. I. L. O can not comment nor help her with solving the puzzle, he can only follow orders. This made it so more satisficing when the main character figured something out. Mélanie Laurent is more or less the only character we see and hear from. I think she could carry the role, but there were instances where I thought the movie was patted out with her being sad, and that sometimes made her preformance fell one-noted. Can we by the way get Mathieu Amalric as a Seri voice? Such a nice and soothing voice!The main problem comes from the location aspect and the mystery aspect of the movie. The location is more or less only the medical pod. Don't get me wrong, I love one location movies. I think it can create a great focus on the character we are watching instead of working on establishing worldbuilding. The problem here is that the pod quickly wears of as an interesting location, and the main charecter is not interesting enough to carry the movie. You quickly get the layout of the pod and the camera can only do so much to make it interesting. While it creates a sometimes claustrophobic look, it also sometimes feel like the pod is giant. There was a very beautiful transitional-shot towards the end just to say the camera crew clearly know what they are doing, but don't get a lot to work with.What the movie does les well to me is when it gets towards the middle and end. The start of the movie is the strongest part of it, but after a while the movie kinda runs out of tricks and mysteries and I was looking at the timer multiple times to find out how much was left of the movie. The movie tries to make a loot of schocking revelations, but they never really hit me as shocking. I quickly moved on from the revelations and even caught myself saying ""So?"" aloud to myself. Some of the set-ups to the mystery also has bad payoffs. You get a clue early on and layer it so you can use it in the puzzle, and then when it doesn't really make the puzzle look any better you just ask yourself ""why did I save this piece for so long?"" this is, among others, in relation to a clue such as Léon is working with helicopter leaves. The payoff to this is just not good.It also have some scary aspects to it, and here it does not stick to that genre either. It seems like the movie has multiple identitycrises doing it´s runtime and If it just stuck to one them it would feel more complete. Not a big fan of the ending either. It kinda made the movie seem pointless, as well as most of the moral dilemmas presented in the movie.Overall, I did not really enjoy my time with this movie, it seemed like it did not really know what It wanted to be, so it just became everything. It seemed like a movie without purpose or moral and kinda just went by. Even though I found the beginning of the movie strong, it simply does not save the rest of the runtime. I really don't know who I should recommend this to at all so I will end this by saying, it´s a too long movie with an identity crisis, too small scale to call it anything special yet too big for what it´s trying to do. The movie fells like it has a lot of cogs turning but it doesn't.","3","mickeythechamp"," A movie that feels like it has more going on than it actually has

"1679","This movie had maybe 15 minutes of story, if that. Idiotic plot contrivances drag it out. Like the 911 operator who thinks she's joking, because that's what 911 operators do. Or the A. I. programmed to not answer questions or be helpful in any way. Or the sheer stupidity of basically tying somebody up inside a life pod and then not having a way to open it from the inside. Can't see the point of that except to stretch out the first ten minutes of the film. This is the future and the best solution for somebody trapped inside who needs to escape is to bang on the door and scream. You gotta do better than this, Netflix. First Stowaway and now this.

"1682","Oxygen is a Netflix sci-fi thriller directed by Alexandra Aja.Melanie Laurent carried this one scene, one actress movie beautifully. The movie opens with the main character waking up inside a cryogenic pod with no recollection of who she is or how she ended up there. Her only ally is the AI, MILO, manning the chamber.The first act is mainly Liz (the MC) freaking out, trying to remember who she is and how she got into this predicament. The second act is filled with impending gloom as she realises that she's quickly expanding her oxygen supplies yet has no means of escape. These were the most thrilling and engaging aspects of the movie because we experienced the frustration, claustrophobia and fear along with Liz. The cinematography does a great job of emphasising this claustrophobic environment as well as capturing the futuristic pod.The let down is in the third act for me, I thought it fell a little flat from what was promised. Regardless, it kept me on my toes the entire time.","7","akonaludidi"," Engaging performance

Waking up trapped in a cryogenic unit, the main character had to figure out who she was before oxygen ran out.The first 2/3rd of this movie was pretty typical of a claustrophobic thriller. It built up certain things before the twist came.And there wasn't only one twist. The last third act became a showdown of twists with each one coming after another as the main character figured out what was going on. This was where tension became high, and when I enjoyed the movie the most.There were fear, panic, and confusion about what was real and not. And Mélanie Laurent played the role very well and delivered all the emotion.The visuals were also stunning. The camera angles on the main character throughout the movie were creative. There were also other visuals, but I can't talk about them without spoilers.Overall, an entertaining last third act made up for the typical buildup.

The ancient greeks had the concept of ""Deus ex-machina"": a mechanical gimmick that came out of nowhere to solve the problems in the narrative of a theater play.

"1713","Oxygen: A French SciFi movie with a new take on the fear of being buried alive. Instead of waking in a coffin a woman (MÃ©lanie Laurent) comes to in a medical cryogenic chamber. The AI monitoring the unit, MILO, tells her that she has just two hours of oxygen left but won't unseal the pod. Communication with the outside world is patchy and communication is often cut off. To make matters worse the woman is suffering from memory ls but with flashbacks suspects she has been put in the capsule maliciously. A tale of claustrophobic terror with hopes of rescue rising only to be dashed again. She has to battle not only her own panic but also the other enemy within- the AI which, helpfully, wishes to sedate or even euthanise her. The tension is maintained but you may solve at least part of the mystery about whats really going on. Nevertheless there are are a few interesting plot twists with good effects and a great performance by Laurent. Directed by Alexandre Aja and written by Christie LeBlanc. On Netflix. 8/10.","8","Pairic"," Boxed In

"1714","Claustrophobic... It reminded me of the wonderful ""Buried Alive"", a modern, utopian, technological and less dramatic version, perhaps due to excessive modernization we do not have enough empathy, as it was in ""Buried"" ...

But it is still distressing, compenetrante, especially the second half where science fiction and drama externalize more intensely...","8","RosanaBotafogo"," Good...

"1715","It is a good, solid SF film, it keeps you invested in it with its twist and turns.

Main characther can be at times bit annoying with her outburst but other than that, solid performance. So if you are a fan of SF, or you are a gamer ( reminded me of games like Horizon Zero Dawn), then you should give this one a try...and do use original language, read few subtitles from now and then :-)","7","deroxybox"," It is a good SF for late night binge

"1716","As this film opens a woman wakes in an airtight medical cryogenic chamber. She has no idea who she is or how she got there... or even where 'there' is. The unit is controlled by an artificial intelligence called MILO; this informs her that due to an unspecified problem she is rapidly running out of oxygen. If she is to survive she will have to recover enough of her memories to learn about the situation she is in... and avoid some of MILO's attempts to make her little remaining time more comfortable.Going into this film I'd say the less you know the better; there are some good twists and it is best one learns facts at the same time as our protagonist. The film is, apart from a few brief flashbacks, set almost entirely within the cramped pod; this gives an impressively claustrophobic feel to proceedings. The more we learn the greater the sense of hopelessness. MÃ©lanie Laurent does a really fine job as our protagonist; you can feel both her anguish, fear and occasional optimism as situations change. The inside of the pod is well designed; large enough for some movement but not enough for full movement. Overall a solid film for sci-fi fans who don't demand lots of action.These comments are based on watching the film in French with English subtitles.","8","Tweekums"," Good claustrophobic sci-fi

"1717","I must admit I was skeptical when I first read about the movie. But I did watch it with the kids. Was a decent experience. Some scientific details were quite off for our current understanding how certain things work but I guess that is OK.I also had some doubts about rationale of the underlying idea but I guess if one takes it apart then no sci-fi stands the trial. I can understand why some are disappointed. No outrageous cgi and effects were limited but I am tired of movies being carried on effects mostly with a platoon strong group of main characters.As said I enjoyed it. Kids did enjoy that too. The little one was shortly off at the end but I guess that was too much for 10yo.I gave it 7 for good acting and good story.

"1718","Summary:Oxygen is much more than a film about confinement or a mere claustrophobic exercise that takes place in real time: it is a spatial elegy that tells us about the indissoluble relationship between identity and memory, about the anguished reconstruction of the latter and that at the same time time that wears elegant and sober high-tech devices, lavishes moments of ineffable poetry and more than one epiphany.It is another of those films with many merits (and undeniable affiliations) that instead of analyzing it for what it is, some criticize it for what it is not or for what it ""should be"".Review:The film begins with Elizabeth Hansen (MÃ©lanie Laurent) ""waking up"" in a cryogenic capsule that has a virtual medical assistant called MILO (in the voice of Mathieu Amalric) who informs her that due to a technical malfunction, the oxygen levels in the module are dropping. Constantly. But who is Elizabeth? Why is she there? Where is that capsule? The protagonist will look for answers and a possible way out of her distressing situation.Oxygen is another of those films with many merits that instead of analyzing it for what it is, some criticize it for what it is not or what it should be according to them or establish superficial comparisons or affiliations with others. It is an intimate science fiction film where the protagonist must face an initial situation of absolute confusion (she does not know who she is, or where she is or why), as if her awakening were a new birth, a chrysalis trying to get out of her confinement. That is why Oxygen is much more than a film about the confinement or a mere claustrophobic exercise.The film takes place in real time inside the capsule and constitutes for the protagonist a strenuous exercise of rebuilding her identity from memory (with her exterior screenshots), interacting with the friendly but relentlessly algorithmic MILO (reminiscent of the HAL of 2001 but also of current virtual assistants)The director Alexandre Aja knows how to make the most of the successful design of the capsule and skilfully does not incur repetitions (filming in such a narrow location is a challenge) counting on the great performance of Laurent (in a true tour de force acting ).If we have to look for affiliations, I would point to Gravity and 7500 (which takes place almost entirely in an airplane cabin) and others that I cannot reveal, although in this case the coordinates are clearly futuristic science fiction.There is in this film a certain ineffable poetry and more than one epiphanic moment, aided by ROB's remarkable electronic music.Oxygen is a spatial elegy that has all the resources to move the viewer.","8","danybur"," An anguished reconstruction of identity

"1719","If you are claustrophobic it may be a good idea not to watch this. If you like movies that do a lot with very little (at least seemingly little), you will be entertained. Aja does another movie that is in a tight place .. even tighter than the last one he did with the crocodiles (or is alligators? I always mix those up).Amazing performance by the lead actress. Say what you want about him or his films, but he really knows how to do psychological horror ... this is well thought of and makes sense overall if you take the Science Fiction parts into account. We're not anywhere near freezing people for their safety ... for whatever reasons.The guessing game is there and you may like where this heads or be appalled/annoyed by it. I dug what this did - another good Aja then.","8","kosmasp"," Fresh air

"1721","Patience, as Hans Landa suggests. It's easy to get carried away with criticism, when watching a low-budget movie, especially Sci-Fi, when your expectations have been raised with the likes of (Insert your favorite high-budget Sci-Fi movie).The story (and acting) did all the heavy lifting. This movie does a great job in conveying the claustrophobic experience Melanie's character has to go through, with the countdown to death keeping the suspense. Plot keeps you guessing with each twist, and makes the audience imagine what they would go through in each step. Granted, some decisions can seem far-fetched, irratic, but given the conditions and the origins of the main character, it should be enough to forgive its flaws.This movie gave me ""Moon (2009)"" vibes, eliciting a virtual simulation of an emotional ride I would have, if I was in the protagonist shoes (pod).","8","kimbrys"," Attendez la crÃ¨me

"1723","'Wait till the end' someone wrote about this ""movie"", which means there's a plot in there somewhere, but the whole movie is basically one long wait for it. Unfortunately 50 minutes of oxygen was all I could muster for this story. ""Movie"" is also a term I wouldn't use for it, since literally nothing moves really: No character development, minimal plotline and very restricted body movement from the main character. It felt like one of those long jokes you have to sit through simply to see if the punchline is worth the wait. That just annoys me, but that's personal of course. During ""oxygene"" came this breaking point for me where, regardless the brilliance of the plot, it wouldn't justify me having to go through another minute of boredom basically. I just didn't care. The challenge for the producers obviously was to deliberately minimize space and character and still get the audience hooked, but they failed for me. Is it fair to write a review of a movie I didn't finish? I don't really care either.","3","info-650-994633"," Ran out of oxygen

"1726","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Alexandre Aja caught my attention when he delivered one of the biggest surprises of 2010, Piranha 3D. A vast majority of viewers expected that film to be absolutely awful, and while I don't exactly love it, I added the director to my list of filmmakers to follow closely. After years of trials and errors, Aja apparently found his great breakthrough with 2019's Crawl. A disaster flick that, once again, people anticipated to be one of the worst movies of the year, and it ended up as one of the very best in the genre, at least in recent memory. Therefore, I was obviously not going to miss Oxygen, a French-speaking film that boasts a highly mysterious premise.Movies like this make spoiler-free reviews really challenging to put together. This Netflix film possesses dozens of plot twists and impactful revelations that I just can't delve into, so it's tough to share my complete thoughts on the most significant moments of the movie. So, I'll work around the explicit answers to the intriguing questions that ultimately make this film incredibly captivating. Christie LeBlanc offers a fascinating screenplay packed with everything a one-location, claustrophobic, enigmatic thriller should have to be successful. Honestly, it's one of the most well-written scripts I've seen in quite a while within the genre.For those viewers who hate ambiguous movies, Oxygen is far from it. Every single question raised by the narrative is clearly answered. No viewer will leave disappointed for not understanding hidden meanings or vague themes. However, I can't state this enough: LeBlanc's screenplay holds *dozens* of questions and the same amount of answers. It's impossible to convince everyone in the audience to accept every twist, especially during the revelation-heavy third act. From a specific moment onwards, it's an overwhelming flow of shocking information that might prove too much for some spectators. Nevertheless, most viewers enjoy nitpicking something that isn't present in this film: ""movie logic"" issues.If you've seen the film already, you're either going to wholly agree with my latest statement, or you probably think we watched different movies. As usual with this type of problem, it all depends on people's perspective and mentality regarding heavy sci-fi elements or truly advanced technology. In fact, for many audiences all around the world, just the fact that Mélanie Laurent's character is stuck in a futuristic-looking cryogenic pod with a Siri-like AI helping her understand what's happening is already stretching their believability limits. Not everyone can suspend disbelief in the same way, so I won't be surprised if Oxygen receives a more divisive public response.Nevertheless, I firmly believe this will end up as one of the most overlooked/underrated films of 2021. Aja proves his tremendous talent behind the camera by making an average-length movie inside one of the tiniest places a protagonist was ever stuck in for most of the runtime. Each new block of information about the where, how, why, and when concerning the main narrative is carefully handed to the viewers with *just* the right hints to what's truly going on. Even though the audience is also imprisoned in the same place for almost two hours, Aja and Maxime Alexandre (DP) create innovative, suspenseful manners of keeping the momentum going, never letting the film feel too monotonous or tiresome.Mélanie Laurent's exceptional performance is one of the most vital elements of the movie. Without her terrific display, it would be extremely challenging to continue to feel invested in the character's mission of finding out everything that's happening to her, including who she is. Her role requires ridiculous emotional range, and Laurent demonstrates all of her immense talent. Technically, the cryogenic pod features impressive technology, some of it created by remarkable VFX. The ominous score by Robin Coudert also brings another layer of mystery and suspense to the already obscure film. Overall, it's a perfect example of how low-budget movies can still be astonishingly well-made.Finally, Aja and LeBlanc bring several themes to the table, identity maybe being the biggest one. What truly makes us human? Feelings and memories? Physical suffering? It's impossible to dive into this subject without spoiling some of the most shocking moments of the story, but it's only one of many underlying storylines that ultimately make Oxygen a beautiful example of profound storytelling. General topics such as health and politics are also approached, as well as moral dilemmas regarding extremely advanced technology and what humans should do with it. Honestly, it's been three days, I watched two other films meanwhile, and I'm still thinking about this one...Oxygen is a phenomenal example of one-location filmmaking done right, which will, unfortunately, escape most viewers' radar. Christie LeBlanc's extremely detailed screenplay packs shocking, impactful revelations and plot twists that will leave no one indifferent. Brutal moral dilemmas, surprising discoveries about the mysterious protagonist, and a fantastic one-woman show from Mélanie Laurent keep the slow, flashback-heavy narrative engrossing. Boasting many underlying themes, Alexandre Aja maintains a suspenseful, tense atmosphere with a sense of urgency that never quite leaves the screen. Maxime Alexandre's creative camera work and Robin Coudert's mood-setting score elevate this deep study about human identity without ever feeling too ambiguous. For fans of claustrophobic thrillers with sci-fi elements, Netflix currently holds one of my favorite movies of the year. Highly recommend it.Rating: A-","8","msbreviews"," Oxygen is a phenomenal example of one-location filmmaking done right, which will, unfortunately, escape most viewers' radar.

"1745","A young woman awakens in an airtight medical cryogenic unit, and discovers that she is trapped and that the unit's oxygen levels are falling rapidly. Suffering from memory loss, she does not remember who she is or how she got there. She is assisted by an advanced A. I. named MILO, but it refuses to open the cryo unit without an administrator code. Using MILO, she is able to transmit outside the pod and contact emergency services. She provides them with the cryo unit's model and serial number, which are printed on the interior. Upon contacting the manufacturer they are told the unit was destroyed three years prior. Unable to recall her memories, she looks for clues about her past by searching for pictures and articles through the AI computer and finds her name, Elizabeth Hansen. She realizes she is a cryogenic doctor. She finds her husband, Léo Ferguson, and his contact number by accessing her social media, but when she calls his number a woman answers. She tells the woman that she is Léo's wife and demands to speak to him. The woman seems confused and hangs up.As the oxygen level continues to fall, she begins hallucinating and tries to open the pod, only to be electrocuted. She then receives a call back from the police but suspects they are hiding something from her, and disconnects. The unknown woman she called earlier rings and tells her that her husband is dead. She also gives her the administrator code to open the pod, but tells her she cannot open the pod or she will die. Elizabeth uses the code, and begins floating without gravity. After a brief explanation, it is revealed that she has been placed into hyper-sleep for a 14 light-year journey to another planet. Her secret mission is to travel to a new planet, as mankind will be extinct in the near future due to a deadly virus. The virus also killed her husband, Léo.Heartbroken by the truth, she deduces the awakening was due to a processor overheating and realizes she must divert the functions of the processor to another processor assigned to non-essential functions, but initially fails since the data exceeds capacity. As time passes by and with oxygen levels fading, she prepares for suicide by attempting to open the pod. Shortly after, she discovers Léo is also in hypersleep in the damaged spaceship together with nearly 10,000 others, but she notices he lacks a scar on his forehead that he had before. Upon further investigation, through a video presented by an elderly version of her, it is revealed that she is a genetic clone with the original Elizabeth Hansen's personality and memories implanted, including memories of Léo. The woman she has been speaking to on earth is the original, and now elderly, Elizabeth Hansen.MILO activates a euthanasia protocol due to a non-existence chance of survival, however Elizabeth's clone manages to deactivate it and successfully diverts the functions of the processor and is put back in hypersleep. The final scene shows the clones of Léo and Elizabeth on the new planet smiling, embracing each other.","9","tamojit12"," Nice Movie.

"1750","OXYGEN exceeds all expectations of what a confined thriller can be. Mélanie Laurent plays a woman who is trapped in a cryogenic chamber and cannot remember how she got there or who she is. At first, it seems like typical pandemic movie that showcases Laurent's incredible acting chops, but as the film progresses and more is revealed, the film ends up being far more intricate than it lets on. Laurent is incredible throughout this film and carries the narrative effortlessly despite being the only character we see (for the most part). Director Alexandre Aja also brings a lot to a little, making a movie that is shot in one location feel grand in scale through amazing visual effects and enthralling storytelling. Another highlight is the score by Robin Coudert, which builds suspense like a horror movie at times and then transitions to a grandiose build that feels like a science fiction epic a la Blade Runner.This film is one of the biggest surprises of this year so far, and might be one of my favorite ""pandemic"" movies yet. Aja proves that with creativity and talent that he can make a tight thriller feel like a major blockbuster, which has been missing from many other attempts over the past year.

"1760","""I cannot satisfy that request for now.""In Oxygen, a woman wakes in a cryogenic chamber with no recollection of how she got there. As she's running out of oxygen, she must rebuild her memory to find a way out of her nightmare. This is a surprise. I'm not sure many thought this would be a good movie really. With Alexandre Aja's directorial track record, it's been misses most of the time. The only movie of his that I watched was Crawl a couple summers ago, and I didn't mind that one. Maybe not as good as it could be, but Oxygen is a tense ride from start to finish. If there's one thing going for it, the atmosphere makes for an entertaining watch. So much suspense is built that you'll want to know what's going to happen next. The first act is pretty predictable in terms of what beats it's going to hit. If you've seen Buried with Ryan Reynolds, the two bear many similarities. And at points it does feel like a knock off version. But with as many turns it takes, it diverges into its own thing by the third act. More developments in the story could've been useful, however.The most fleshed out aspect is character. Being in one location with one character obviously gives us a good sense of character. Mélanie Laurent as Liz is extremely good. This movie went through a bunch of setbacks before production and Anne Hathaway and Noomi Rapace were attached to the character before Aja was ultimately chosen for the director. She's really good. Basically, she carries the movie. I also appreciate the voice acting from Matthieu Amalric as M. I. L. O. A few times through there are flashback sequences that draw away from the main story. They serve as character development but honestly don't do much. It's awkward and could've been cut out. Because if we're being honest, all we wanted to see in this movie was the struggle to survive. There are many things that should be kept secret before watching to avoid any hints at the reveals. Oxygen is good, but could've been better. It's one of those that would be good for a movie night, though.","7","sweidman-28016"," Tense From Start to Finish

This resembles the film in more than one way.It is in fact done well, the acting is good, it is visually interesting and engaging.

"1763","Oxygen, the new trapped room sci-fi thriller on Netflix, does a decent enough job playing with its claustrophobic premise to entertain the audience. For audiences who have seen trapped room movies like Buried, Cube or Panic Room, it is familiar territory.A woman wakes up trapped in an airtight cryogenic pod and discovers the oxygen levels are running low. With no memory of who she was or how she got there and using the online A. I. MILO, she must figure out a way to open the pod before the air runs out.Mélanie Laurent, from Inglourious Basterds, does a great job selling the claustrophobia, peril and eventual paranoia. The central mystery kept me hooked and guessing what was going on. When the final reveal came, I wasn't as surprised as I should have been from my knowledge of genre conventions and there could have been more red herrings emplaced to make me doubt what was going on.The film is directed by Alexander Aja, who directed one of my favorite films from 2019, the alligator thriller Crawl. That was a movie that viscerally places the audience into its horror scenario and they can imagine it happening to them in that real world setting. I actually felt more trapped in Crawl than in Oxygen. The sci-fi setting here kills all the tension.Oxygen, while entertaining as a one-time watch, feels like a step back for Aja. Oxygen plays like a student film with a professional budget, like a first-time director showcasing what they could do if they were given more money. But I know already. I have seen Crawl.Ultimately, I wanted more from Oxygen, whether that means more playing around with genre expectations, plot twists or a personal statement.","7","ObsessiveCinemaDisorder"," An engaging functional sci-fi trapped room thriller

As she's running out of oxygen, she must rebuild her memory to find a way out of her nightmare.Wow Oxygen was an incredible psychological thriller. It truly made the most out of its limited setting. The idea of being trapped inside a container with your oxygen slowly going down was really intriguing. The cinematography was really creative, there was an incredibly tense atmosphere and tone, almost making you feel claustrophobic just like the main character. The setting up of the stakes was excellent. There was a really interesting mystery throughout. The performance from Melanie Laurent was fantastic. The development to the plot and main character was excellent. The main character was also clever and made good logical decisions which made a nice change. The emotional weight and sympathy for the main character was well earned. The rising of tension and added layering to the stakes was fantastic. The plot twists were insane. I also loved the slow reveal of the character background for the main character. The set up for the final act and the final act itself was fantastic. The emotional decisions the main character had to make was very intense and I had never seen something like this before with having to decide how much of your life expectancy to take away. The jumpscares and the gore was very effective. And it was a satisfying ending.My slight negatives would be the repetitive failures for the main character largely due to the one setting, and I would of liked slightly more depth to the main character and the story world. Also the English dubbing was slightly annoying but that wasn't the films fault.Overall, Oxygen is a clever, intense, and engaging psychological thriller, that keeps you on edge throughout constantly trying to figure out what's real. It was a very well done film, that just needed that little bit more depth to have slightly more impact.","9","rnixon-15663"," oxygen

"1765","Perhaps it's the sci-fi take but this movie, as technically beautiful as it is, just doesn't have the power of the movie it takes after, ""Buried."" Melanie Laurent is wonderful in this but can't match Ryan Reynolds entrapment underground in a coffin. Worth a watch but don't expect much.","6","msghall"," Lesser sci-fi version of ""Buried.""

"1766","Good little film. I say ""little"" as it is small in scope and scale. Its a film that is okay to watch the trailer, as it won't reveal much and remains pretty much spoiler free. I think most know the premise, and not expecting much---it is Netflix after all...was surprised at how well done this film was made and how the final act most won't see coming. If you like smaller but cerebral sci-fi...ala Moon or High Life, this is right up your alley.I'm okay with subtitles and would have preferred over the dubbed to English version, but wasn't too distracting as it was.","7","MK_Ultra_"," Secrets kept well

"1768","Alexandre is back again, now with a thrilling french sci-fi flick which feels both fresh and exiting. Mèlaine Laurent brings an excelent portrayl to how anybody would have felt in her situation. She also manages to keep the audience hooked when she is locked down in a box for the whole movie. In my eyes is that pretty damn impressive. The cinematogrophy feels fresh, the editing is good and the overall set design and CGI is very well done.Overall Oxygene deliver a new and stylish sci fi thriller wich blends ""burried"" and ""gravity"" into one.

"1771","While Mélanie Laurent's performance was exceptional, you need to have at the very least a 5.1 speaker system or else this movie will be nowhere near as good as it is with surround sound. To be honest I'd say that if I had watched it with the stereo speakers from my tv, i'd have stopped watching after 20-30 minutes.However that doesn't mean the movie is all about audio -indeed the plot contains interesting revelations- but sound is key here and is very well intertwined the image, so it is a major component of the movie (as opposed to marvel atmos movies for eg) and since it's a ""no exit"" movie (it all happens in one tiny closed space) the picture alone might become boring if no surround sound is there to accompany it (in reality the picture is what accompanies the audio).Now if you've got any 5.1 sound bar or better, the movie is great, but it's not for everyone, indeed being a no exit movie entails that fans of movies like the Avengers and other Marvel movies won't enjoy this as it might feel dull, but it's only because the sound here is what engages the viewer and creates a true immersion.","9","personalaccount-30577"," To enjoy this you NEED atmos/surround

"1775","Join Buried, Gravity, and 127 Hours with 2001 and you'll catch the vibe of the Netflix single-location sci-fi, Oxygen. With only one main character, Liz (Melanie Laurent), director Alexandre Aja and writer Christie LeBlanc have crafted an intriguing space mystery about a scientist trapped in a cryogenic coffin with only 19 minutes of oxygen left.Not only is it nail-biting to witness a smart lady contesting her death with a Hal-like computer, M. I. L. O (Matthew Aamalric), but it is also interesting to connect with our experience of claustrophobic COVID-19 and our wish to live. How filmmakers can make the experience epic while the stage is a small pod is the magic that draws me in and doesn't let go.Another suspenseful part of this thriller is the regular reminder of how much oxygen is left, or rather, how much time she has before death. Like a detective in a crime novel, Liz has to use all her resources (her mind) to find out how to stop the descent. Part of the tension is that the filmmakers allow her to cry at times when she should be conserving the air as we shout from our comfortable seats for her to stop. This sexist trope is out of date.The most human element besides the will to live is her drive to re-unite with her husband, Leo (Malik Zidi), who also is doing the cryogenic dance. Like a dream in which she is close to her goal but never reaching it, this segment is the most emotionally powerful.Oxygen is a smart sci-fi with enough smart challenges to satisfy the most discerning cinephile-and the rest of us who just enjoy well-made films.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","jdesando"," Well made, suspenseful, a seriously good sci-fi.

"1776","Judging by the IMDb score, I probably enjoyed this movie a lot more than most. But with that being said, I thought ""Oxygen"" was fantastic. The whole film rests on the shoulders of MÃ©lanie Laurent's performance and she knocks it out of the park. I really sympathized with her and I wanted to see her make it out ok. The story was fascinating and lead to some twists and reveals that left my jaw on the floor. This is the best looking movie I have seen from Alexandre Aja so far and I really hope he keeps making movies like this. Let me put it this way, if a movie about a woman trapped in a space coffin for an hour and forty minutes can keep my attention, that's an achievement by itself. But ""Oxygen"" is so much more. The story, the script, the characters, the cinematography, the production design, the music. All of it, in my opinion, was mesmerizing. I highly recommend this movie to those who are looking to get a good fix of sci fi, and also those who are looking for a good mystery. Highly recommend!","9","averylubocki"," The Best Sci Fi Film I've Seen In Years

"1778","You want to see someone in a coffin-sized space trying to get out before they run out of air, you watch Buried (2010), not this. This brings in unnecessary psychotic breakdowns, boring flashbacks and random screaming that could've been easily cut out to get a better result.And beyond that we get yet another dystopian sci-fi about the end of the world from our good old suicidally-depressive Western culture, i.e. Another The Midnight Sky, oh boy, such fun. And they actually think they ended it well by putting a microscopic sample of our population on some faraway planet with extremely uncertain environmental conditions, where those few will probably die off rather than have any chance at re-conceiving(!) and rebuilding any semblance of civilization.This Western doomer-sci-fi trend needs to stop.

"1784","I was a bit skeptical if I really wanted to watch this movie, but it turned out a lot better than I had expected it to be. This movie stands out by far from all the other movies that also offer you a single setting spot. This movie sort of engulfs you into the fictional world and puts you into the character's shoes that treats you some stress and self-preservation from non-existent harm.I was literally holding my head during some scenes and my heart kept pounding. With that said, the directors made a good job and definitely did something unique to make it as good as it is.The only reason I am giving it a 9 is because the area of filming was limited. Other than that the movie is well executed and I'm definitely recommending it to anyone that wants a heart-gripping experience.","9","Kamil_An"," Interesting plot, worth the time to watch it; first real review

"1785","I liked the production value and I think Melanie Laurent did a fairly solid job in her ""one woman"" show. However, the key ""twist"" of the story was obvious to me in the first 10 minutes making it insufferable to get to that revelation after 60+ minutes. Liz, the protagonist, was constantly unable to ask the right questions which, in a story like this one, is the only thing keeping it afloat. When the audience thinks faster and is two steps ahead of the lead, it is just unbearable.So predictable its unfortunately a dissapointment.","4","jasha89"," Predictable

"1786","I am not sure if I've watched the same movie as other people who are scoring this one with 9's and 10's. I am a big fan of Aja's movies but I can't defend this one.First, the movie itself is pretty slow, incoherent and full of plot holes. Second, acting is just OK from the main character. Nothing remarkable to remember. Last, even it's only 90 minutes the rhythm is extremely slow and lack of real tension. Everything look overreacted.So, overall pretty far from real good old Sci Fi movies. Not for me.","3","danielcereto"," Boring

"1787","Apart from some logical mistakes it could have actually been a modern sci-fi classic. Intense and beautiful, with many classical sci-fi elements. And very unusual for a sci-finto be french! Although, the last 10 seconds literally made the rating drop from 9 to 7. In one sense i actually even think those last 10 seconds pretty much destroyed the movie entirely so maybe to be fair, it shouldve gotten max 5. But everything up to the last seconds was superb so I cant help myself to give it 7. Anyway, a perfect example of a unexperienced director that is so unsecure so that he/she feels the need to state something which is already obvious and already communicated, but in the cheeziest, most Hollywood B-movie way imaginable.","7","himmelsvid"," A potential masterpiece ruined by director's insecurity

"1788","The acting is well done. The story keeps the viewers on its toes and much to the imagination. Piece by piece the viewer finds out what is going on.

Definitely better than most of the Netflix Originals of late.","7","michielpieterhoogeveen"," Engaging claustrophibic thriller, unsatisfactory ending
"
"1789","What drew me to Oxygen was its director Alexandre Aja. His films have always intrigued me, if not, left me entertained. While horror seems like his mainstay, it is interesting to see the guy play around other genres lately. Oxygen is his second sci-fi outing (the first being ""Furia""). To call Oxygen a thriller would be a bit of a stretch actually, and that's a shame given its core plot and premise. Melanie Laurent plays a woman named Liz who wakes up in a cryogenic pod with no recollection of how she ended up there. It's an open-ended premise, with numerous possibilities. The setup is minimalistic, and it's Laurent's immediate surroundings (needles, tubes, and electrodes) within the pod that we see for most of the film.As a sci-fi drama with mysterious layers, Oxygen is worth a watch. There are twisty revelations aplenty (some work, some don't); there's a subplot surrounding Liz's memories about her husband that focuses on the emotional angles, while the desperate need to avert the low oxygen situation takes centre stage. The issue here is that the latter (i.e. The major plot device) feels less intense and tension-inducing when compared with the 'who am I?' or 'why am I here?' subplots. Since the film almost entirely takes place within the pod, every twist (including the climactic one) is relegated to Liz communicating the right set of instructions to the system's AI at the right moment.I didn't particularly enjoy those fleeting moments of horror that Aja tucks into the flick using lab rats. The claustrophobia did kick in to some extent, and I kept mentally communicating with Liz to not waste oxygen by acting all panicky. The film also uses memories as a device to drive the story forward, which comes across as a bit of an overkill. All that said, Laurent's emotive face, being the film's one-and-only focus, is the saving grace. With cleverly packed tension and a shorter runtime, Oxygen really could have been something.","5","arungeorge13"," Alexandre Aja's second tryst with sci-fi is only partially engaging! [+51%]

It was sort of like a black mirror episode because it's just about what technology can create and what makes us US?

"1803","""Buried Alive"" meets ""Solaris""I throughourly enjoyed this film. Despite some people saying it was predictable at points, which I can see that now, I went it to it with no expectations.It started for me as it implied, someone stuck in a chamber, perhaps in a hospital, or maybe kidnapped. Then we learn that this is actually a spaceship destined for a new planet. THEN we continue to find near the end that our character and everyone on board is not even real, but clones of the doomed on Earth.This movie is sometimes terrifying in the hopelessness and anticipation for death, with many attempts at survival falling short, until we get a satisfying ending for the future.I think for the right people, it did what it wanted to do and was surprising, and even if you saw it coming, I think it was still filmed and told exceptionally.","8","yusufpiskin"," Alexandre Aja

"1804","Alexandre Aja and Grégory Levasseur. What could possibly go wrong? Quite a lot actually, but somehow we ended up with a winner.First conceived as a Christie LeBlanc screenplay in 2017, Oxygène struggled through years of production hell. The original decision to cast Anne Hathaway in the lead role was quickly recognised as a mistake, and she was soon replaced by Noomi Rapace. Franck Khalfoun came on board to direct, with Aja producing.But by 2020 it was all falling apart. Aja kicked Khalfoun out of the director's chair and seized it for himself, while Rapace was dismissed over concerns about 'ideological syncretism.'Following a discussion with investors that Aja later described as 'passionate but not entirely unreasonable, with intermittent screams', Mélanie Laurent was chosen as the new lead.Oxygène won't win any awards for innovation, and leans a trifle too heavily on its meagre cast of just three(!) credited characters, but its heart is in the right place and its cinematography implies the budget of a much bigger film than it actually is.Mathieu Amalric is the clear audience favourite, with his cool and calming Parisian tones. Malik Zidi does what he usually does, and does it tolerably well. But it is Laurent who really steals the show as she grapples with the dilemmas of a late middle aged existential crisis.It was Foucault who said 'People know what they do; frequently they know why they do what they do; but what they don't know is what what they do does.' Oxygène takes this wisdom and toys with it, teasing out the conceptual strands for a gentler, more compassionate examination.Aja and Levasseur are intent on answering the questions we almost never dare to ask: questions about life, memory, dreams, and the philosophy of loveplay. The conceptual framework here is reminiscent of Brecht and Eisler, but with a distinctly Büchnerian flavour. It's an aggressively bold experiment, and I revelled in the audacity of it all.I rate Oxygène at 23.31 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a perky 7/10 on IMDB.","7","Sankari_Suomi"," A miasmic ebb & flow of confluent possibilities

"1808","Cheerio from my local.I like Alexander Aja. I like he how attempts different genres in each new release; Haute Tension (brilliant) to The 9th Life of Louis Drax (not my thing), he mixes it up. Here, he's giving Science Fiction a go - and the result is uneven.We learn Earth has a real deadly virus (not an overblown one for a change), all humans will be extinct in two generations. Solution? Make clones, put them on a massive space ship and send them light-years into the abyss to populate a planet that's barely inhabitable...they have to life in the portion that is neither daytime nor night, they must rebuild in the area that is permanently dusk. It's a pointless detail. Earthlings in this story are advanced, the universe is big, why not keep it simple and have relocate to normal planet.Despite our intellectual abilities, we're still not smart enough to avoid a collision with a named/identified Asteroid/MacGuffin that destroys a good chunk of our plucky space ship, but able to continue on. The space rock isn't important...it's only needed for the plot.From my vast knowledge of space travel, we should have shields or something. Also, a Stargate would be helpful. Oh well...perhaps the Asgard will lend an assist. Thor? Anybody?Anyway, a cloned woman accidently wakes up from ""hyper-sleep,"" and instead of getting up and enjoying a mini-vacation in space like Hollywood's Pratt/Lawrence did in the silly, Passengers, she is trapped in her pod without any knowledge of what happened. She initially doesn't know she's a clone; possess only fragments of her memory left over from the super brilliant Strong Women that she was made from.Like all ""hyper-sleep"" pods, this one is equipped with a talking computer who informs her that oxygen is running out, thanks HAL, I mean MILO. The helpful and homicidal pod also keeps trying to inject her with a death serum - I have to admit; the automated injector arm was amusingly quick - darting around her attempts to grab it. It made no sense, but it's entertaining and a nice touch to add some action to an essentially one-location, cramped set.There's always a timer, isn't there? It's a nifty way to create tension. Simple set-up and fairly entertaining first act. The problems arise once we find out more about her predicament and the subsequent collapse of logic.With the help of the talking computer, she is able to make a phone call home. As she's chatting, she's told that the connection is getting weak and they will soon lose the ability to communicate. Hokey dokey...we also learn later on that she's been in the pod 12 years - moreover, she's never been out of the pod...bummer for her, convenient for the plot. I would ask why the pod has so much tech in it, when its only purpose is providing medical assistance, to include euthanasia, until they reach their destination?Once the film was over, I gave it some thought. There are moments of entertainment here, great camera work given the environment. A solid attempt to dole out the mystery slowly. A reasonable acting job by the main clone. As a homeowner with a lot of Maple Trees, I did appreciate the artistic design of the pods...deploy and let them ""helicopter"" to the surface.So much was left unanswered. Such as supplies needed...did we clone any animals, plants, food, shelter? I like cats, so any cat clones on the planet? Who knows?Aja, ended up telling the wrong story. He made the universe outside of his main storyline much more interesting. Ultimately, the plight of one hapless clone wasn't important. Her death or success wasn't important. It was just one small occurrence wrapped in a much larger story.With all that, it's still worth watching and if you're an Aja fan as I am, it's worth your time...but, it's not better than a 5 star in my view.","5","clanhellekson"," OXYGEN- MY THOUGHTS

It's one of those movies they simply can't seem to produce in Hollywood, meaning this movie doesn't need the endless explosions, sex-scenes, people shooting each other, and flying cars colliding in the air that a typical Hollywood movie always has to offer as its main attraction. Oxygen has the intelligence that most Hollywood produced movies just seem to be lacking. Also explains the somewhat lower rating, as it probably doesn't meet the low expectations of the typical US based viewer. Guess too many people out there are so used watching nothing but endless repeating garbage. Ah well, you're never too old to learn.

Its a futuristic, singlecast production of pretty high value that make time fly faster that you will believe, if youll let yourself into robotic stories like this.This is not a must see film, other plots under the same umbrella of lost and claustrophobic captivation has been issued before, but this one is outstanding due to very clear language, believable acting, and a sesless loss of hope and control as the story reveals itself.

"1821","""OXYGEN"" directed by Alexandre Aja and written by Christie Leblanc. Available on Netflix.When a woman wakes up in a cryogenic chamber with no memory, she'll struggle to escape as the oxygen in her capsule begins to become critical. Her only means of communication is an onboard computer named MILO with which she must discover who she is, why she is there, and how to remedy her nightmare before time runs out.The French director leaves the piranhas (Piranha 3D) and killer crocodiles (Crawl), to finally sign a high-concept thriller shot in claustrophobic atmosphere with a wonderful Melanie Laurent. The generous and involved French actress takes up the challenge with amazing interpretation. With her face and voice as her only means of expression, Laurent runs the gamut of emotions, from fear to anger to grief. She simply gives one of the best performances in an exercise where she was not particularly expected.While claustrophobes will start to feel dizzy, the narrative finally gets out of this ""jail"" and allows us to escape and discover her memories at the same time as the heroine does. The flashbacks in the hospitals, with masked patients and doctors, make the tension rise even more strongly on these particular days of COVID.Nevertheless, the film don't fall into weird conspiracy and remains on track avoiding even any resemblance with the thriller 'Buried' except for their concept of confinement. The script never ceases to surprise with its rich concept of thematic and narrative twists and turns, and feeds the curiosity of the viewer who constantly wonders about the resolution.Alexandre Aja directs a thriller in a confined environment of a very different kind, but very effective. With current themes of isolation, loss and fear of an uncertain future, ""Oxygen"" has never lived up to its name. Thanks to solid direction in an incredibly confined space and the phenomenal work of Melanie Laurent, the film becomes a welcome breath of fresh air in today's world.","7","Lostounet"," Breathe in, breathe out

"1829","Oxygen is a very interesting film. This film never stops taking turns, making it very difficult tot predict what's coming next. From the first scene to the last, one revelation of the storyline segued into another so swiftly, the credit goes to the director for managing to build the film so craftily. The audience will hardly be able to digress from the film, it is quite enthralling.The film started off steadily, kept the audience almost in the dark until the middle of the film. Then in the midway after revealing some strings of the plot, some might think they know where this is going, though it still made many swift unpredictable turns, but still by midway you would start to care about the character and keep on going. This is not a dumb movie, it grazed many ethical scientific issues which are already in motion or pretty soon the humanity will face, which will make you think long after finishing the film.Melanie Laurent did an wonderful job, her performance was pivotal for the film's success.","8","ikadery"," Thought-provoking and Gripping

"1830","MILD SPOILERSI just finished this movie and I love it! At first it's unassuming on what is happening on the first half. She suddenly woke up from a deep slumber while medical devices are attached to her body. She doesn't remember who she is, nor why she is trapped inside a cryochamber. Her only companion to whom she could talk to is an A. I. called MILO. MILO informed her that the oxygen reserves in her pod are only at 35% and she may die of asphyxiation she doesn't do anything about it. From here she decided to do some investigations on her own to find out everything she needs to know about who she was, where she is, why she's trapped in the cryochamber and how she can survive by using MILO to aid in her investigation. I enjoyed the second half of the movie when the first major plot twist was revealed (there are two) I especially liked her conversation with the female doctor who revealed to her where she is and what happened (first plot twist) and her finding out who the doctor was (second plot twist).8/10.","8","freudable"," A Sci-Fi thriller who manages to deliver even if self-contained

I don't think he is even shown speaking a word, further distancing us from relating to the plight.3) The plot drags a bit too, although there's a lot to digest and sift through. The ending is quite terrrible,with an abrupt halt that seemnsd to be borrowed from those montage sequences.

"1836","#MovieReview #Oxygen #SpoilerFree #MelanieLaurent #Nerflix #NewRelease #FrenchThe spellbinding heroine of Inglorious Basters Melanie Laurent returns with a taut, engaging sci-fi survival thriller that is also alarmingly topical and relevant to today's day and time.Oxygen is a French film (available with English audio on Netflix) directed by Alexandre Aja, who is known for his quirky, over-the-top narrative style.After awakening in a cryogenic pod with no memory of herself, the film follows our protagonist-Elizabeth (Laurent) as she tries to claw her way to the outside while keeping her psychological demons and ever-encompassing panic at bay.Superb POV camera work and sensational close-shot expressions from Laurent makes the viewer experience all the claustrophobic fears of the protagonist, and the twists constantly keep you guessing.A nail-biting cerebral thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seats.A must-watch.

"1839","I liked this movie. It is always a good thing when one location movies can keep the audience hooked, and this one does so successfully. Flashbacks give the much needed breathing room and present the backstory, hence story-wise they work well.However, the way story was told is very ineffective. Knives Out is a good mystery, Looper has good mystery elements. Lost is a cool and mind-boggling production. Oxygen as a whole, on the other hand, at times is boring, and in other times predictable if not pointless. Take, for example, the fact that she was a clone. Now ask yourself, so what? So what if she's a clone? What would change if she wasn't? Can you see the moral dilemma that answers to these questions may present? That's 24K gold right there and yet the story never actualizes that potential as well as many others. Simply put, character work is too thin to make this movie deserve any score that is higher than a 3 on my IMDb list, but this doesn't mean that it's a bad movie. I certainly enjoyed my time. A touch of suspense would certainly help elevate the quality of the work.The ideas presented in the story and the concept is cool.

But you do have the biggest space battle ever filmed with lazers and atomic weapons. This is a movie where you think that you know that the person in the movie know what everyone outside the movie knows, but it is NOT the case. In 1977, something like this happened on earth and they was not anyone left to tell about it so this movie can tell the story for that when it did happen.

"1848","Have you ever watched movie called 'Buried' starring Ryan Reynolds?It's the same thing, but (kinda) sci-fi, french and much much worse.The quality of the 'capsule' is nice, but that's all the praise I can squeeze out. Everything else makes me just wonder ""why""? Logic behind Lizs' action is dubious. Technology makes my eyes roll. Holograms, yet still can't do anything better than 1st iteration of faulty google AI, that can't even answer basic questions ""cause reasons""? Hundreds of buttons, screens, panels... But they are useless? A capsule that requires a code to open... FROM INSIDE?! Whole 'room' flashes angrily red while it malfunctions? That sure as hell will be usefull for confused occupant of said capsule, yeah, lets just make him even more confused while he can't see panels nor anything. Smart. A static noise while calling via net? Really? A policefolks still operating like it's early 1900s? No.. actually, that's correct.Main character, Liz, a scientist, acts like headless, highly emotional, chicken with extreme glimpses of inspiration, suddenly asking extremaly relevant questions... just to act like a goof right after untill next flash of wisdom. Terrible, totally pointless and annoying flashbacks. Listen, movie, what's the point of quick flashbacks here? Other than disrupt the flow of the movie?Overall: she doesn't act like human being. The script makes her too artificial. I do, however, like (sarcasm) how she undermines her own survival by going into hysteria. Yep, nothing fixes your issues as good as turning your brain off to scream while your *insert movies name here* deplates. Smart.If you guys like detective puzzles and try to actively work on solving the mystery, or even try to compete with actor with 'who gets the correct answer first', this movie will be nothing more than mudcake to eat through.

It was a quasi ripoff of Dean Koontz's Intensity, one of the most thrilling books that I had read till that time. I was hooked on to Aja's work and have followed him closely over the last 15 years.He has churned out some low brow stuff such as Piranha but I have been blown away by The Hills have eyes, Crawl and now Oxygen.There are quite a few twists in this, which I didn't foresee and which changed the whole narrative.

"1869","Sci-fi is extremely rare in French cinema ,but Netflix lent a helping hand and presto ! An estimable work well acted by reliable Mélanie Laurent.Mélanie's fate,in the first part of the movie , may remind you of Ryan Reynolds' in the excellent ""buried ""(2010); what does it matter if Reynolds is buried alive in a coffin by a group of Irakis and if Laurent is locked up inside a cryogenic chamber with the highest technology? ;both try to communicate with the outside world , both are more and more anxious because their oxygen is running out ; and voices they get tell them to take it easy ,but actually makes them more terrified by the horrible fate which lies in store for them. Ryan 's got only a mobile phone ,Laurent has plenty of paraphernalia around her,but most of the time,it backfires against her : ""the charitable euthanasia"" trick almost verges on black humor .There's an unexpected twist halfway through which explains why the heroine is stuck in her chamber,followed by awesome pictures which pack a real wallop .The second part is not as gripping as the first one ,and there is a certain blandness infiltrates the story .But it's so rare to see French actors in sci-fi (too bad that Malik Zidi 's part is so small) that it's cause for celebration.","7","ulicknormanowen"," Where am I ?

"1873","Well, that's a rarity from our French fellows. French movies are usually without any ambition nor that great of an appeal for sci-fi fans, but this one is solid and it can compete with an American sci-fi movie. I usually hate French cinema, even though I loved 70ies to 80ies French cinema, they lost their way, but I enjoyed this one, it makes me wonder if I should start watching French cinema again. I love the ""1 Room"" movies, and this one is on par with what's existing already. There's some excusable problems with the script when they're undermining some payoffs, by adding a twist on a twist on a twist on a twist... which makes it all look less important at the end, but the rest is very good! The acting is clean and believable, orchestration is what you'd expect, the ""stage"" is fine, even though the small screens inside the pods look like they were taken from an 80ies knight riders dash board, it's still excusable since it doesn't take you out too much. The flashbacks shouldn't have been used in the beginning of the movie, it just make it look weird, but later on, they're at the right place.

"1877","Now this film was surprising, to be fair I wasn't expecting much, however I'm not sure my lack of expectation had any impact on feelings about the film. I did see the trailer for this a while back and didn't really think anything of it, thankfully the film is much better than the trailer.This film, for me, is the breakout performance from Justin Timberlake. Now for years I have always thought that he only appeared in films due to his fame and that he didn't really have any talent. He would always play the cocky, self centred, handsome guy. There was no other level to his performances, to me anyway they were always the same. I have never taken him seriously whatsoever, that is until now. ""Palmer"" is not just a good performance from Timberlake, it is a fantastic performance that I feel even deserves award consideration. I know that is a giant leap from being just that famous singer that appears in films to Oscar worthy performances, however I feel that its warranted. He is absolutely terrific in the lead role of Palmer, it is such an understated performance for the majority. I don't see him ""transforming"" or going deep in ""method"" acting, its just an honest and phenomenal performance from start to finish. If this is the level that he can act too, why has he waited so long to show everyone. From not liking the guy that much I cant wait to see his next project.Now the story is not as straight forward as you might think, there are a ton of story threads in this film. Thankfully all of them get there screen time. The main focus is Palmer getting out of prison and restarting his life. Add the introduction of an ""abandoned"" little boy who lives next door, into Palmer and his grandmothers lives. Obviously the most serious topic of the film deals with people being able to accept that Sam, the little boy, is gay. It is a very difficult topic to get right and sensitive one at that, personally I felt the film handled it really well. However there is a section of our society that will hate this film regardless if it handled it well or not......its sad but true. Plus enter Sam's drugged up mother and dodgy boyfriend, Palmer's love interest, social services. There is a lot going on in this film however all of it works in harmony, all these threads have satisfying conclusions, which is rare to see.I'd have to also mention the great writing and directing of this film, without them both it wouldn't be as affective, especially emotionally. In the wrong hands this film could be to confusing or would prioritised some elements of the film more than others.Overall its 70% out 100 its a surprisingly good film and one absolutely incredible performance from Justin Timberlake who I thought was stellar. Now I never thought I'd ever say that hahaha. To be honest its great acting overall. Complex, relevant, interesting, heart warming story with some great writing. This film delivers what its selling and then some.","7","Lewis_Heather787"," Breakout Performance !

A boy in the wrong body, gay, confused, trans and to top it off he's saddled with a druggie mom. You know what's going to happen. Doesn't make it any the less heartwarming and sweet. I think JT (Palmer) did a great job, I've always thought he was a decent actor. Sam was really good, as far a child actor go, I think he's got it! It's a feel good movie, so if you don't like that kind of movie, then don't watch it. Pretty simple if you ask me. If you like a sweet film then watch it.","9","cscott2331"," Very sweet.

"1884","... to give a low rating to this film!
Acting by the lead actors is excellent and the story is not just heartwarming or just politically correct. This is a story about all the way acceptance - no questions, no doubts, no preaching about right and wrong!
I expected that at some point Palmer, being the supposedly macho character in the film, would sit the boy down and explain a couple of things to him. But no, he didn't! And this is precisely what is great about Palmer and about ""Palmer"" the film. Full, absolute, acceptance: people, even little people, are who they are and sometimes there's no point to denying it, there's no point to trying to change them. Let us be as instinctively wise as Palmer and realize or feel when this is just the case!","9","jdc-07171"," One has to be clueless...

"1885","Coming from a person who grew up absolutely despising ""boy bands"" and the like, Mr. Timberlake was often a butt of jokes in my circle. To be honest, I looked at him as a talentless fabrication in the 90's. I would have never imagined an entertainer that I looked at as so lacking prove me so wrong. I enjoyed this movie very much. The story was touching and the acting was very good but what brought it was Mr. Timberlake. I would have never have thought he could pull off a roll such as this. I give my rating because of his performance. Quite impressive to say the least. I almost equate this to Shia in ""The Peanut Butter Falcon"". Great job by all.","8","turdymac"," Mr. Timberlake..

"1887","I don't know if all the possible realities portrayed are as common or as valid as real life often shows us, but within the logic and the narrative of the story, all the emotions were so human, and so relatable, I cried a few times troughout the movie. No emotional blackmail, but real human interaction with the ordeal of the characters. That was very powerful.Juno temple really took my breath away with her performance as the mother of Sam. The moment she realizes she has to hand over custody of her own son, who she is hurting by being her incomplete self, the raw feeling of both courage and a cop-out, with all the inner turmoil knowing your kid is going to choose someone else over you, and you agree with that... I can't put into words what that does to me as a father, if I would be in that circumstance it would kill me, it would rip my heart out. And it is such a powerful moment.Not a moment you feel pressured in taking sides, on the contrary. I oftentimes felt quartered by my constantly shifting loyalty between the different protagonists in this movie, and the struggles they went through. Justin Timberlake is a great actor, Ryder Allen is marvelous and does such a great job at being both vulnerable and unwaveringly true to himself and the chemistry between the two is so well captured, I can go on and on. There are definitely some classical all American standards that might put you off in any other film, but in this it is the string of pearls of real moments and real emotions that hold the movie together and overshadow any shortcomings in the peripheral story lines. Go watch the movie. Well worth the investment, mainly the emotional kind.","8","jwvandegronden-1"," Amazing... Well written, great acting, and gutwrenchingly honest

"1888","Justin Timberlake played such a great role in this film. His facial expressions in my opinion, definitely made me feel what he was feeling especially when it came to Sam. Perfect movie for those who can't or I should say won't allow themselves to accept people for who they are. That way of thinking needs to go. That cycle needs to end . Palmer was a little sketched out at first but before one knew it, Palmer had a whole new way of seeing as well as accepting it. The little kid who played Sam was amazing !!! He made me want to give him such a great big hug. He is as real as real can be. Watching this movie gave me a ray of hope in mankind. I'll definitely watch it again !!","8","vrobello"," I'll definitely watch it again !!

"1889","This is a well acted but completely predictable movie. It has almost zero plot twists from the outset and you can pretty much see where it's going. It's a one and done plot, no deep sub plots or anything. But in this sense it's Ok, it's a nice little story. Just don't expect much depth to it. This is one you sit down, watch knowing what's gonna happen, and are OK with it.Cinematography was good but it looked a little dark and dreary at times, probably to give mood. Like I said acting it pretty solid all around.","7","YRLY59E"," Completely predictable but a cute enough story

"1890","I thought this movie was going to be another 2020, PC, manipulative tale of an ""average joe hero"".
'Palmer' exceeded my expectations and had an intelligent, powerful script with great actors fulfilling their roles and engaging the audience in every scene.
Justin Timberlake has already proved himself to be a great actor and he clearly reached a little further down in this performance to bring a tonne of depth to his character. This movie highlights the multitude of life's unknown obstacles and the fact that no matter how hard things maybe, everyday brings a new sun.","8","glenn_gallagher"," Who doesnt love a tea party..... #girldad

"1891","Despite of its clichéd and overdone nature of the narrative, Fisher Stevens' 'Palmer' offers a thought-provoking and emotionally powerful drama about acceptance and second chances. There are few films that are willing to approach the subject matter of gender identity and the bullying that comes from that, and yet this film knows how far to go and what the focus of the story should be about. Both Justin Timberlake and Ryder Allen deliver outstanding performances, as well as the rest of the cast.","6","Sir_AmirSyarif"," Clichéd and overdone, but still offers a thought-provoking and emotionally powerful drama

"1895","If you plan on watching this movie, skip the trailer as it contains a few spoilers.I decided to watch this after seeing the reviews it was getting, luckily I hadn't watched the trailer.
To me this was just ok. Overall it's a warming story and all the actors gave good performances, especially Justin Timberlake and the kid who plays 'Sam'.However, the story along with Timberlake's character was slightly predictable and this isn't the type of movie that sticks with you that you remember for years to come.While I enjoyed the relationship between the 2 main characters, there wasn't actually much drama between them or them having to overcome any obstacles / differences in their own relationship.
Timberlake's character is pretty accepting of the boys character straight away, which isn't bad, but it doesn't provide any drama at all. Rather the drama for them comes from the rest of the world and this is what makes it predictable.","6","Leungzy"," Not a bad film, just ok... don't watch the trailer

"1896","As a public school teacher for 30 years, I strongly object to the use of the term ""gender-confused"" for the boy Sam in this film. Unlike almost every adult in the movie, Sam is not confused, but is very clear about who he is and what he likes (dolls, princesses, tea parties). He is comfortable is his own skin. Can we not slap a negative label on him and just call him a sweet, well-adjusted child who just doesn't happen to conform to stereotypical male traits? Thank goodness to have less testosterone in this world!!","9","susancwilson-78199"," Not gender-confused
"
"1897","Before The Social Network was released back in 2010, I never thought of Justin Timberlake as an actor. Yes, he was solid in the film Alpha Dog, but I believe that being directed by David Fincher really broadened his horizons. Starring in films like Friends with Benefits, Trouble with the Curve, or even In Time, he has proven that there's more to him than meets the eye in terms of acting. Palmer only furthered those thoughts for me. While Timberlake never seems to choose projects that will win him awards, he's always very, very solid in whichever role he does take. Palmer has many similar tropes to movies you've seen before, but here's why the subject matter, along with a great central performance by Timberlake, warrants a viewing.After serving time for over a decade, Eddie Palmer (Justin Timberlake) returns home to live with his grandmother, only to see that a troubled family lives next door. Their young boy Sam eventually forms a bond with Palmer, even though Palmer wants literally nothing to do with him when the film opens. Struggling to fit in for being different than other boys in his school, Palmer slowly becomes the father figure that this boy may just need in his life. This sort of premise has been done time and time again, just in different variations. What set it aside from all the others for me though, was the fact that the screenplay by Cheryl Guerriero was far better than I expected it to be.Yes, when breaking the overall movie down, there are some very rushed aspects of the story in the third act, but the dramatic elements to the film felt very authentic. You could tell this was a story that came from the heart. I believed the majority of the dialogue that nearly every character had, which is why I also feel that this movie sputtered slightly towards the end. As much as I loved the dialogue written for these performers, the meat of the story is whether or not Palmer is the right fit for Sam and certain elements of that are sort of thrown away in the third act. There is a resolution to everything, but it feels rushed in comparison with the rest of the film.Now to dive into the performances, because this is a film that relies heavily on selling the premise at hand. As I said, I've always enjoyed the on-screen presence of Justin Timberlake and I truly believe that there is an argument to be made here that he's never been better. I was engaged in this film because of his committed performance. On top of that, young Ryder Allen played off him incredibly well and their bond made this film so much more likeable. Alisha Wainwright as Maggie was also excellent, and Juno Temple as Sam's mother Shelly has a couple of scene-stealing moments as well.In the end, Palmer is the type of film that's designed to be a tear-jerker and those types of films can feel extremely heavy-handed, but I'm just glad to say this one doesn't. It took me on an emotional journey and I was in tears by the end, but it never felt forced. Sadly, the conclusion is far too rushed and revelations and answers are brushed over multiple times. It's almost as though this movie was too focused on creating dramatic scenes that it forgot how to properly reach a conclusion. Still, I really enjoyed watching it and I believe it's worth your time. Palmer is now streaming on Apple TV+.","7","kjproulx"," A Solid Drama with Some Issues

The only good people are the excon (Timberlake), the LGBTQ young boy, and the teacher and janitor that happen to be black. The acting is decent throughout but the actors are held back by the terrible script and all of the contrived situations. The plots seems like it was following a lifetime channel checklist for a sappy story. A southern setting? Check. Excon who has a big heart and just made a mistake when he was young? Check. A trailer trash meth addict mom? Check. Intolerant cops, church goers, and employers? Check. Incompetent social workers? Check.This movie fails to impress.

"1904","Without question, this is Justin Timberlake's best performance to date, yet it won't take a rocket scientist to determine how quickly Palmer (JT) and Sam (Ryder Allen) bond with each other, considering they're both outcasts in a southern town. Also, the story stumbles during its third act, coupled with the expected return of Sam's mother (Juno Temple) to the screen, still there is nothing she can do except looking alternatively pathetic and hysterical. It doesn't help that the film trots out so many clichés about the 'South' (and the hardscrabble folks who live there). In the end, nothing about this film is downright bad, but ""Palmer"" never lives up to what could have elevated the story and J. Timberlake's performance. Also, movie does nothing new in its story, playing safe rather than bringing something new to the table, being just a decent distraction from all the madness with COVID-19 pandemic right now, with some lovely moments between Timberlake and Allen that is primed for a reunion in something more deserving of their talents.Rating: 6+ Watchable","6","akcenat"," A one-time stream drama ""Palmer"" is too predictable, being just a nice little feel-good (TV) movie

Once this part in the movie comes around you will quickly realize what is going to happen next, there isn't any twist or surprises. At the end you will either love it for the message or just be bored of it.

I am not against people doing what works for them... and I think I would react similarly even though I have no kids nor have been in prison.. but there is something about how the kid protraid his character... I think generally as long as a kid is supported in what they want to do and are treated well, that's a good start even if I may think it weird that a boy is playing like a girl... but this kid played the character so well, I can't imagine a real human not wanting to support them....Much like how Timberlake was in Black Snake Moan... it is interesting to see the development of damaged characters and helpful side characters... I'd watch this movie again... even if I could never see the redneck parts of america actually being able to support something like this in reality today even if I wish tolerance reached that far.. but it was really a decent film","unknown_value_please_contact_support","Zokambaa"," Decent movie, and I am neither redneck or flaming liberal

"1914","With almost Every cliché imaginable in this type of film, with this type of content ( no
Spoilers), it is still an okay watch, if not a must see.Pretty cookie cutter characters falling I to their roles... man trying to redeem himself for his past transgressions, addicted mom, abusive boyfriend, caring teacher, helpful grandmother, tragic events, over understanding main characters, loveable child, it's really not challenging, but expected ( and not to hard to see where the story will go). The kid is not bad to watch, for his portrayal. It's one of those stories that ""woke"" people will like for its "" progressive direction ( eyes roll), and others may see as an ""agenda"" film. Either way, it's not, as I said, groundbreaking, just more the idea that... the world will come around to embrace the boy ( no spoilers), eventually, even if at first they don't.I guess if one must spend a lot of time confined to their home due to the present world situation, it's an okay escape of two hours that will pass quickly, as you can see what is coming next. So watch and feel good that the world is so embracing (not) and that there is hope for us all to accept (not).Not the worst thing you will see, but probably not something you'll much remember in a day or so, but at least it's a break from superhero, action and teen flicks that streaming seems to be pumping out, showcasing so much of right now.

"1927","Never given a damn review in my life because who cares about one persons opinion these days. But this film? Is entirely worth the watch and the time spent with it. The narritive was refreshing and gave every character motive, means and reasoning for their actions and feelings. Begining was soild, middle was painful and the ending alittle lack luster in certain parts but the emotional pay off was amazing.Given the setting of the film you freely buy every aspect of it from the different languages and peoples in space. The economy, class system and characters, a sort of ""Ready player one"" mix match of faces in the supporting case that gave the world building a soild foundation. Decent messaging to the over all story nothing really ground breaking and there are some aspects of the story I personally would have liked to see explored alittle more.I'll leave it with this, as someone who loved firefly this film feels like a spiritual nod of respect to what Joss Whedon accomplished with a small budget and a killer cast.

Btw, it's nice to see a variety of countries and languages represented here, not just the usual English only which I find more realistic in a sense. Btw, it is very difficult to incorporate so many different languages and it didn't always work out. But I always thought these futuristic space stories had way too many people from only certain countries ie USA and UK. Star Wars are suppose to be aliens, not even human, far far away and they are still mostly....English speaking white people basically. No one ever thought this was odd? Anyways, looking forward to more sci-fi to come out of South Korea, and other countries for that matter","7","dannypark247"," Not bad at all for their first sci-fi epic

"1933","All Hollywood can do anymore is give us CGI-fest films with no depth in character or story, or remakes that are almost all worse than their originals. Typically, the films tend to mirror the demands of their audience; people who can barely sit through anything that actually requires some attention.Korea gives us a great space story that is a bit of a mixture of Wall-E, Firefly, and Blade Runner. The film also gives us a great balance of story, character, and action. Why does the story work so well? Because like all great storytellers, they focus on the story and the characters.George Lucas once stated, ""a film with special effects and no story is a pretty boring thing."" Funny how he would actually end up going against his own proverb, and it is also true of what has happened with much of western filmmaking, as stated above.The film also has a lot of heart, which will make the viewer all the more appreciative that it isn't just an action movie. This is enhanced by veteran actors like Joong-Ki Song (Descendants of the Sun) and Tae-Ri Kim (Mr. Sunshine) as well as Jin Seon-Kyu.The movie isn't perfect, but if you want a good story, some laughs, and some great action sequences, you won't be disappointed.","8","spasek"," South Korea is the New Hollywood!

"1935","...you end up not caring about those flaws.I grew up in the post WW2 influx of Japanese SciFi movies flooding the US, so I can appreciate how a foreign film can turn people off after a while...but this South Korean entry into the mix does something that I find intriguing...it grabs your attention with the production values and presentation.. Yes, it uses old worn out themes from just about every US flick ever produced, but that ends up not being a distraction since the director keeps shifting your focus...This is a multicultural movie, using actors from many different nations, and it is worth watching I think...oh, the CGI is very well done too, mixing it up with some decidedly 'Steam Punk-ish' sets too...in other words, Space Sweepers is a refreshing departure from the usual foreign fare...","7","bheadher"," Sure it has flaws, but if you stick it out...

"1936","Protagonists are very cliche (their background stories & personality traits), so is the antagonist (as often seen: big tech company gone bad, its evilness is poorly motivated...). Classic good versus bad story, lacking of grey levels. Very typical, expected plot & outcome, with lots of plot armor on the way. Fans of action & light entertainment will like it, sci-fi fans (like me) might still take some pleasure because of visuals & the general setting.","6","scientiaetveritas"," Great visuals can't conceal the weak plot
"
"1937","Space Sweepers is a really impressive film considering its budget of $20 million USD. The CGI and sets are great, and it really proves that you can make high quality films for a cheap price. Aside from that, Space Sweepers is pretty average. The story doesn't really offer anything new and its pretty cliched. The acting was the worst part about Space Sweepers. The main actors were decent enough, but the supporting cast gave underwhelming performances. Lastly, Space Sweepers is way too long, they could've cut about 15-30min and it would've improved the pacing by a large margin. Overall, Space Sweepers is a slightly above average film. The only thing that's holding up this movie are its impressive visuals. I'd only recommend this film if you're into sci-fi and space fights, but if you're coming for a story, then you should give this one a pass.","6","DeBBss"," Technically impressive, but lacks a good story

"1938","I swear to god, I don't usually post reviews on IMDB, but I just had to review this one. Korean movies seem to be stepping up getting even better than some of big Hollywood movies.My brain still not able to process why people can't enjoy anything anymore? Seriously why the bad reviews? It's like some people ran out of dopamine in their brains to feel happy.This movie has it all, comedy, grief, joy, mystery, excitement, suspense, it's like an all-in-one package which triggers every emotion you have. And the Visual effects were insane! dude I can't believe they only spent 20M$ on this one. It was next level seriously. I wouldn't be surprised if they said 1B$. Not to mention the sounds effects were out of this world also.Please, don't waste your time reading the bad reviews. Some people are having a bad day. Go ahead watch it, I highly recommend it and trust me you will NOT regret your decision. It's 10 out 10 for me.","10","naderofficial"," What's up with the bad reviews? THIS IS A FREAKING MASTERPIECE.

"1940","This movie has a lovely story, characters, setting, visuals, action and a strong message that will make you appreciate our planet with unique new love.
Spiced up with cheezy kitsch aspects typical for Korean movies, depicted precisely for parts that can forgive such handling, it offers a joyful ride, seriously awesome action and effects, and an emotional thrill.
It also plays with a cult of personality and irony, sometimes on a trace of good old Starship Troopers from 97, has unique insight in a colonisation of Solar system similar to, although not as serious as, the masterpiece - The Expanse, and it takes out the best from Cowboy Beebop.
This is not a sci-fy with internal science-proof story as Stargate for example, but it doesn't intend to be bigger than it is. It's refreshing to watch as a honest, fun and touching movie.
The parts I would like to point out further is great and strong characters without that annoying 'socio-political corectness' and placing something in a movie just to be oh so modern, and absolutely amazing blend of all cultures and languages.
It evokes feelings of unity, togetherness, love, and it actually has a lot of humour, once you get used to the language(s) used. Humor, irony and criticizm of society are slided in elegantly, almost as Psy makes fun of rich Koreans in 'Gangam Style'.
I will now hapily go lie down in my yard and kiss my planet Earth for still sustaining us, and then I will attend to my recycling.","10","vukicevicdora"," Entertaining, versatile and unique

"1941","This Korean production clearly rivals Hollywood ones. Many point at Firefly as inspiration, but I would say Valerian is also a good comparison. The story is original and has an interesting premise. The CGI and set design are top notch, no question about that. The multi-lingual thing isn't too distracting to me, as I am watching it with subtitles anyway, but that actually resolves ""why everyone speaks English in movies"".The deal-breakers for me are, however, the screenwriting and editing:
Many scenes are unnecessarily long.Instead of ""show, don't tell"", they foreshadow it, then show it, then also exposit it. Say, a certain underground fight sequence. It is foreshadowed by a friend's visit, then with the knife, then the person is shown, then said person explains everything... That's too much, don't you think?The transition between set pieces is not smooth. Consciously you know they are heading to the next location to progress the plot, but the cuts are jarring.The timing of events are also quite bad. Say, in a rescue mission, the protagonist has the time to leave the ship to do a side quest, while the crew is supposed to be leaving immediately, and he manages to catch up. The finale is a time-critical mission, but there are at least two extra set pieces inserted. Then when they have just broadcasted a message out, everyone is already there somehow.The hero's realization happens too late, and too sudden. But you know it's going to happen since early in the movie, so the protagonist is being an unnecessary a**h*le throughout most of the movie.Too many plot twists. Some really obvious, some really bad. The final one was brilliant and heart-wrenching, then they have to ruin that with another plot twist and a plot hole as a byproduct.Too many plot holes. I feel like the writers have some plot milestones to hit, but just lazily filled in the sequences in between.Background characters, like people watching the news, are given close ups. But their acting are so bad/stiff...All in all, I like the concept, and I am surprised by the quality. But there are jarring holes in the execution that I just couldn't ignore. For storytelling purpose, I would say a trilogy or a miniseries are more appropriate formats for this IP.","7","isabellacheng"," I so wanna like it more...

Acting was great from the main characters (please turn off the dubbing). Few people are complaining about the CGI but just ignore them, they're spoiled from watching movies with $200+ million budget. I could only imagine what Koreans could do with that kind of money spent. And please don't make comparison to the Expanse, Firefly, or anything else because it's completely different. Only similarities are that it's in the future and outer space. If you think this is bad, watch the $250 million budget John Carter. A huge letdown!

They also tried to do a robot character like Bender or K2SO, but ended up leaning closer to Jar Jar ...Overall the film's storyline is probably better than Valyrian, but not as entertaining as ridiculous Jupiter Ascending...

"1950","There is some quality hidden inside this movie, although it can probably not be fixed in its entirety.I dig the happy crew vibes of this movie but this movie is sloppy to say the least. The flaws in the story didn't bother me as much as the flaws between the scenes, this made it a particular hard watch. One moment a main actor is about to sacrifice itself and then he walks back on the bridge. Enemies and good guys seem to appear out of nowhere to give this movie an overdose of plot turns or set up scenes.You also will get sidetracked a lot into unessisary scenes that are only distracting. A lot of my criticism would be fixable by just releasing a better cut, removing distracting scenes that don't progress the storyline and removing scenes that don't tie up loose ends, and then its needs to set up the remaining scenes properly with some more dialogue, this last item would be a hard fix. This movie is probably a 4.5 and i am giving it a 5 just for the attempt and for the love of sci fi. If they would fix it i guess it has an 6 or 6.5 potential.","5","MRT_"," I guess there is a movie hidden inside a lot of space sweeping junk

"1954","Let me begin by stating that I am a fan of Korean cinema. They make superb movies that exist contrary to the stereotypical efforts coming out of Hollywood recently & as such are a breath of fresh air. Space Sweepers, however, does not deserve the same accolades. To begin with, I was put off by erratic behaviour from the characters as they displayed cartoon-like, exaggerated responses, behaved irrationally at every turn & would suddenly launch into fits of violence for no apparent reason. Really. It was like a bad martial arts film. The dialogue was far too rapid & to be honest I just couldn't keep up with the subtitles. The action sequences were choppy & it was difficult to follow exactly what was supposed to be going on. To make things worse the story was not sufficiently engaging & after about half an hour I gave up. On the plus side though, the special effects are stunning,","3","bigpaul6-740-221238"," Disappointing

"1959","Here is one thing I wish other reviews had mentioned: it's a children's movie (OK, the English title is a clue, but I'd assumed that was just an awkward piece of translation from Korean). It's spectacular and all that, but I challenge anyone over the age of nine to put up with these characters, situations and dialogues for two and a quarter hours without drifting off. If you are above that age, this functions best as background while you are working, doing homework or playing a videogame: it really won't require any of your attention, and the loud noises will warn you whenever there is something on screen worth watching.","5","Go6565"," A children's movie, not a SF epic

"1960","It seems that despite the cool graphics, sets and budget, the editor or director just slapped the cuts together while being drunk and called it a day. I dont understand who let this get published as it is. If they just spent a fraction of all the money and time on piecing the story properly, it could have been a great movie. The plot cuts and trips as the timeline progresses, you have to pretty much guess half of the story as you go. Many key scenes and explanations are missing. I would say that a Tom & Jerry cartoon has a more comprehensive story flow than this. Was exhausting to watch and it really is a shame.

"1962","I just finished this Netflix movie and OMO! Wow. What a game changer for K cinema. As a long-time sci-fi fan, this is now easily in my top 10 films of all time in that genre. I love the reimagined Wizard of Oz allegory, dynamic plot, production quality, talented international cast, and richness of the elaborate multicultural world and full-bodied characters - amalgams of collective dystopian civilizations and all my favorite elements of some of the best sci-fi movies that have crossed our paths through the decades - 'Blade Runner', 'Serenity', 'Guardians of the Galaxy', 'The Fifth Element', 'Total Recall', and many others. A handful of awkward lines as well as scenes with lukewarm tertiary character acting or mildly disjointed transitions do detract a few decimal points from a perfectly seamless viewing experience, but the magnitude and refreshing exhilaration of the entire film still overpower those and make it a must-see. The killjoys over at Rotten Tomatoes seriously need to have more fun in their lives.","9","eidolonmd-35-890170"," An Exhilarating and Refreshing Spacecapade

We just had a good time.I had pretty high expectations for Spiral, but even as I was lowering them throughout the film I kept being disappointed. The traps just weren't impressive at all. I've heard a lot of people say the first one was amazing, and while it was filmed quite well, I didn't think it was great either. So many traps that were simpler from the first 4-5 movies had so much more of an impact. I'll skip over discussing a lot of the details of the film and just get to the ending, which had major Saw IV vibes, and left me feeling pretty empty. I'm not one of these people that claims to have seen the twist coming...I didn't, but it didn't make my jaw drop or fascinate me at all. The ending felt rushed and I don't know exactly what impact they were trying to have.I'm giving it a 5/10 simply for the effort of bringing the series back. Rock does a decent job really. I just wish the creativity was there.","5","mccutch22"," Underwhelming return to the cinema

"1981","Now I will say this, this is not a bad film, for most part I quite enjoyed seeing Chris rock as the more serious detective comparing too his more comedic roles in other films. Now if you enjoyed the first 2 saw films, then you'll appreciate the film a little bit more since it has more of a story element and as much as this has some interesting traps and still has a lot of blood and gore, it's not as over the top as the films from saw 3 onwards so it was nice too see it try too go back too it's old element of the first 2 films.Now the main problem I had with this film was the ending, I won't spoil it for everyone but it did feel very rushed and as much as I was praying that the reveal would throw me off and trick me, it was so easy to predict who is the jigsaw copycat midway in the film and was hoping it would be completely different too what I predicted but it just felt rushed. Overall it was a good time watching this at the cinema, not perfect but way better then jigsaw that came out a few years back and feels like a homage to the first 2 saw films.","7","Chiggychiggy"," Entertaining but rushed ending

"1982","Detective Zeke Banks (Chris Rock); is a man under stress. His decision to report a corrupt cop has made him enemies within his precinct and set him at odds with his father Marcus (Samuel L. Jackson); who also happens to be the former Chief of Police.This tension has caused Zeke to be shot in the line of duty when fellow officers refused to respond to his calls for backup which even further inflamed a tense situation and made Zeke a Lone Wolf who is hesitant to work with others and has cost him his marriage.Unfortunately for Zeke; a grisly murder happens and he is assigned a new partner named William Schenk (Max Minghella); to investigate what appears to be a copycat of the long-dead Jigsaw.The fact that the victim is a fellow cop inflames the office and when Zeke is sent a package from the killer which promises more killings to follow as the corruption within his department needs to be stopped.As the victims begin to mount; Zeke and William find themselves in a race against time to discover the identity of the killer and stop the killings.""Spiral: From The Book Of SAW""; is an interesting new entry into the franchise and in keeping with ""Jigsaw:' was more engaging than several of the last films in the main franchise as it gives audiences deeper characters and scenarios than normally shown in the series.While the traps are as clever and gruesome as fans of the series would expect; the decision to target cops is an interesting choice and in many ways reflects the growing cries for reforming the Police but does it in an extreme way and balances out that there are good cops in the mix who serve and protect.Chris Rock also served as a Producer was good in the role and it was refreshing to see him play a darker and more dramatic character. While he still has moments of clever riffs; they are appropriately placed within the film and do not take away from the fact that Zeke is a troubled and driven individual.The supporting cast is solid and while I was able to identify the individual behind the killings fairly early; there were enough Red Herrings along the way that may keep audiences guessing.Director Darren Lynn Bousman who directed the second to the fourth film in the series has made a solid return to the franchise and keeps the dark and dirty look of the film's trap sequences and while they are gory; there is a cleverness to them that should delight fans of the series.In the end ""Spiral"" has enough of what fans of the franchise expect and infuses some interesting new characters and scenarios to make one of the more complete and enjoyable entries in the series.","7","garethvk"," Spiral: From The Book Of Saw Is A Fresh New Direction For The Franchise

On one hand, there's a lot to like and also plenty to dislike about the final product. For starters, the best parts were obviously the traps and the ending, however, the film overall feels rather soulless. It doesn't particularly feel like a Saw film, though I guess at the same time Spiral is the most similar in structure and atmosphere to the first Saw film. But something still just felt off.I'm not particularly a fan of Chris Rock, so I wasn't super impressed by his performance per se but it wasn't as bad as I thought it may be. The rest of the cast does their parts fine, but nothing to write home about. The story is fine, emphasis on fine, but I will say that I do like that this killer is basically hunting bad cops, which is very politically relevant. But a lot of it still felt very forced and the ending, while it makes sense, isn't gratifying enough nor does it even really get resolved (now that they have Saw 10 on the way, I kind of expected the cliffhanger). Also I absolutely HATE this new voiceover they chose for the killer, it sounds AWFUL. Please just go back to the OG voice, I beg of you!Now this isn't to say the film is ""bad"", but it surely isn't very memorable. There are elements that work here, sure, but ultimately the sum of its parts leaves much to be desired. As much as I really wanted to enjoy the film more, I would go as far to say this is probably among the worst of the franchise, despite it technically being a spin-off(?) of sorts (or at least a departure from the John Kramer story). And maybe that's because the Kramer story was so intricate and intriguing, whereas this one is doing more of the same but with a less interesting version of Jigsaw. Hopefully it can be redeemed by the sequel, but I won't be holding my breath. The quality of the franchise has gradually decreased with every new movie, and it's obvious the end times may be near. But with all this said, I will always support Saw and any future films because she's an icon after all!","6","thefendiprint"," Jigsaw says ""ACAB""

"1984","It's very easy to say that the Saw series jumped the shark a long, long time ago. Some may even argue that it began with Saw 2. But it's also very easy to say that Spiral is a refreshing new chapter in the gory series of Saw. There is undoubtedly a few head scratching moments in the film that might make you scratch your head and ask ""really?"", but at the end of the day, since the disappointing Saw 8 came out 4 years ago, I must say -- THIS is the Saw sequel we've been patiently waiting for since the release of the original film in 2004. The story is very intriguing, we're entertained by great acting (especially from Samuel L. Jackson), and the twist is a little predictable but it still had me at the edge of my seat. All in all, I really enjoyed this film and I highly recommend it!","9","jimsty1988"," Pretty Damn Good for a Saw Sequel

"1985","As a huge fan of Chris Rock and a huge fan of the 'Saw' series, when I heard that Rock was behind the revamped 'Spiral' movie we were getting I was beyond excited. Then a worldwide pandemic came along delaying the film by 12 months which only served to get my anticipation levels up that little bit higher. The end product is an interesting one. It's better in some ways than I hoped, and less so in others than what I hoped.What really took me by surprise the most was how much I liked Rock as the lead. Early on we get a little stand-up routine from him (in context of the movie of course - more or less) and then here and there we get little glimpses of his terrific humour which he has obviously inserted into the script himself. But when it's time to get serious he is more than capable. He brings great intensity to the movie and combining that with his natural charisma, makes for a great centrepiece of the film.The film takes a little bit of a step-back in terms of the brutality of some of the traps. Make no mistake, there are some brutal things to watch in this movie, however I suspect a conscious effort was made to reign things in just a little. In previous 'Saw' movies it felt like they were going out of their way to make as many audience members faint as possible. Here is just feels like they are trying to find a good balance between keeping the gore-enthusiasts pleased, and keeping those less inclined to enjoy that type of thing in the cinema.The pacing of the film is lightning quick. There's a little bit of set-up and character introductions early on, but once the action begins it never relents. The film is only 93 minutes admittedly, however it is over before you know it.There's a new voice on the tapes this time around. At first it took me off-guard and I didn't quite know what to think of it. However by the end of the film it had grown on me a lot. It is very different to the one we had in the original series. I will be interested to hear what other people thought of it. I can see it being quite a polarising thing.I won't get into the conclusion of the film (always a treat in the 'Saw/Spiral' universe), suffice to say it is quite different to how we are used to these films ending. I still think I need to go back and rewatch the final scene to fully understand certain character's motivations and what they were trying to achieve. The door has been left wide open for more sequels though so if this one is a success then prepare yourself for Spiral 2-8 in the coming years. I say bring them on.","8","jtindahouse"," Rock is excellent in a same (but different) entry in the Saw/Spiral franchise

"1986","This movie had potential, but the writing was just awful. If you are looking for a nice plot twist, then us best watch the previous ones. Chris Rock made a valiant attempt, but fell short...by a long shot...and should stick to standup or comedies. The kills scenes were rather decent but were a little redundant with the design. Overall, the movie is hollow and falls right in line with the rest of 2020-2021 movies leaving us hungry for a quality product.","4","skylinekiller"," B - Movie Writing

"1987","I'm a massive saw fan. I've seen every saw movie multiple times. This was by far the most disappointing movie in the series. It has nothing that makes saw movies great. None of the traps were any creative really. The punishments for failing the traps weren't nearly as brutal as the previous films. The ending was one of the worst twists in the entire series and everyone I saw the movie with called it within the first 20 minutes of the film. There are also countless unanswered questions and none of them are the good kind. I'd rather be in a saw trap than watch this movie again.","2","ebogart-11645"," Spiraling down the drain

"1988","For any franchise fans that have been around since the early 2000s, I recommend waiting for home release.The editing from floor is either a sea of footage left out or they filmed this in under a month. The film felt like it was cut to be a 90 minute trailer of what they WANT to make a new Saw movie about. It did not allow for the basic fundamentals of cinema to be utilized in scene structuring, not enough beats. Just continuous punches. Chris Rock really channeled Rick Grimes with the camera eye stares.","3","adaniel0206"," Where's the movie
"
"1989","Predictable from the very beginning. These were the same writers who wrote Jigsaw which was easily predictable but less than this film somehow. It was so easy to tell that Chris Rock's rookie partner was behind everything, it was almost laughable. Soon as he showed up on screen and begin talking I could tell it was him. I kept hoping to be thrown off but in the end that wasn't the case. With Saw X just being announced, the studio needs to go with new writers or bring back the old ones. The way this one ends, where the hell do you go now? Chris Rock's character knows who this guy is. I felt they kind of botched the ending. The strings holding Sam Jackson should have ripped him apart as SWAT was entering the room and then they should have shot Chris Rock while he ran in from the side. The rookie shuts the door to the elevator and laughs ""Game over"". The rest of the movie was fine. The traps weren't that interesting and it's different not having the presence of you know who and his puppet.","2","ejones3157"," Get new writers.
"
"1990","Lets face it, the only reason you're going to see this movie is for the elaborate deaths and games. For that, I could recommend this movie, but only that. I mean the acting is bad and there are some very enjoyable moments between mostly forgettable characters but where this movie really falls apart is the story and execution of it.If you watch enough movies of any genre you can start to see patterns when not so talented writers or filmmakers are behind the scenes because they use ""tropes"". I won't spoil it here but the way a particular character is introduced screams of predictability. And then about half way through the movie another moment happens for the same character and it also screams of predictability and the movie just flops it down by the end like it's supposed to be from out of nowhere.","6","darthmorbyva"," Good Games, Paint By Numbers Story

"1991","This is not a movie that might change your mind about the saw series. Personally I think this is one of the worst in the franchise, but WHO CARES? This is a Saw movie. By now you shouldn't have high expectations for this. As a saw fan I thought this was great fun seeing some of my favorite actors in a saw movie, even though it wasn't the best, if you know what I mean. People comparing it to other saw movies need to stop. This movie could just be named spiral, instead of trying to add another piece of ""fun"" trash into the collection. Saw is something that you see for violence, traps, and a good time. You don't see saw movies to critic them.","7","tylertoth-71980"," Stop rolling through these comments.

"1992","I can't understand the great reviews so far but each to there own, as much as I am a fan of the series and Samual L this movie is terribly acted, the plot seems rushed an there were very few scares, the effects were good, if you are a fan of the series give it a go but don't expect vintage Saw.","5","beni_waldz"," B grade

"1993","The best part of this movie is Chris Rocks thoughts about Forrest Gump. Other than that, the script bad bland, and the death trap scenes were half-assed. I could tell who the culprit was from almost the beginning, as to say, there's only a couple to think is the killer when you watch the movie.

"1995","I'll keep this relatively short: It's a good movie worth watching, but if you've seen five thriller/horrors in your life and pay attention to small things, it's entirely predictable 30 minutes in. The traps aren't that great despite what others say. It's a fine movie on its own, though, and probably worth watching. Just don't expect to be blown away like some of these other reviewers.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","jvschoffstall"," Was pumped for this. Predictable 30 minutes in.

"1996","This movie legitimately could be the worst in the series, and this is coming from a Saw fan. What makes these movies great is trying to connect the puzzle pieces as to 'who's behind all of this?' You know you the killer is within the first 10 minutes of the movie.Chris Rock is a let down also. Give him props for stepping out of his comfort zone but man it looks like he just came out of his first acting lesson class.Save your money, it's awful.","4","billybacktown"," Spiraling out of Control

"1997","""Spiral: from the book of Saw"" Is , for the lack of a better word, Terrible. It fails horribly on every front. It's mystery is obvious. It's scares are nonexistent. The directing is stale and generic. The acting is laughably forced and over the top. And the script, well, it's garbage. Chris Rock is a cop who the film wants us to believe is a good cop, the best cop even, so good in fact that he doesn't do anything by the rules. This includes touching evidence with bare hands, not recognizing his best friends wedding ring, watch, clothes, opening random packages delivered to the police station, plugging in random usb drives into police computers, not actually figuring out any clues and never saving anyone. He also is an over acting, one line spouting, cop movie stereotype to the point of embarrassment. He drives a muscle car, has a new partner, turned a dirty cop in, is hated by other cops, and he even has a father who was the chief of police. This is some lazy writing. It gets worse. The traps make no sense, there's no creepy puppet, there's no creepy voice... but luckily it has one thing going for it, the gore. When it's shown it's pretty good looking. It isn't enough to save this dud though. In fact, if I'm being honest, this is the worst of the franchise.","4","afrocut"," Cop Tropes the movie!

"1998","I was super nervous about going into Spiral seeing as Saw is one of my favourite franchises. Chris Rock was an interesting choice as the main role, it took a while for me to not think of Marty from Madagascar. Once i got over that i found his performance quite impressive.There was a disappointing amount of traps, and while the traps were interesting i felt them to be tame in comparison to previous movies, and the victims to be less desperate to get out of said traps. I was massively disappointed in the use of a new puppet and new voice over but I guess i can understand why it was changed. It was also rather disappointing that within the first 20 minutes guessed who Jigsaw was.Overall it was quite a good movie in itself, the intrigue was there, the loose ends were tied, will there be another one? I couldn't tell you. But again Saw is one of my favourite franchises and i would gladly go see any future movies.","7","emilybedford"," Tame, but still good

"2000","I been a fan of the Saw series since the first one and all but that one confusing one. This one came off as a good addition to the series. I think more effort was put into the movie then last few ones. Chris Rock and Samuel Jackson was a nice addition.I was very worried that they would inject social messages into the movie because of the plot. But I am happy to say they resisted. It is about bad cops but the way they did it, it was not related to recent events .","7","greenbizkit33"," Well done movie
"
"2001","The thing I loved about all the previous Saw movies was the intricate plots and great twists at the end. In this one the plot was fairly standard and the twist predictable.Chris Rock's over the top performance didn't suit the role at all, although the other actors did a great job.The traps were also boring, and there was no tension or thought that they would escape at the end.It wasn't a terrible movie but a very average police procedural with some generic Saw traps.","6","tloader-1"," Too ordinary for a Saw movie

"2002","While this had some good moments and good traps and a decent storyline, this isn't anything special or new, and should have been far more superior than it was. Chris Rock was better than I expected but I still think I'd like to have seen someone else in the role. Unfortunately though this was far too predictable as it's very obvious early on who the Jigsaw copycat is. Unlike other films there wasn't much subtlely. A shame as they had an opportunity here to make something really exciting.","5","bangel3322"," Very average

"2003","This new chapter in the Saw series is a great start! Chris Rock did an awesome job leading the film! I like that the audience is thrown right into the thrilling action at the very start! The comedy was just enough and not too obnoxious. The jigsaw traps were not as gory as past films but was enough to make you cringe. I wish the movie was a bit longer and spent more time on the backstory of the other officers. I feel like the ending was too abrupt but I understand it's setting up future films. I am pleased overall and can't wait to see the future of Saw.","7","ljayharbour"," Astonishing!!

"2005","Spiral: From The Book of Saw is a spin off movie set in the universe of Saw. The movie tells an interesting and new story that feels different compared to the other Saw movies but not too different where it doesn't resemble a Saw movie. The movie is filled with sadistic traps and Saw fans will not be disappointed with the amount of gore in this movie. With that being said, the plot twist of the killer's reveal is sadly lacking compared to previous movies. Spiral: From The Book of Saw indicates a brighter future for the Saw franchise.","8","rubenpasaribu"," Spiral is an entertaining and fun thriller.

"2006","When this was announced and I saw it was starring Chris Rock, I was very skeptical of him being attached, but the trailers still showed a great deal of grime and decent resemblance of the lengthy Saw franchise. Well now that I finally saw it, my fears of a failed attempt at a serious Chris Rock portrayal became all too real. His acting is absolutely atrocious and cannot be taken seriously especially in this grizzled franchise. There are times where you can literally see him almost laugh or crack a smile in the actual film. NOT ALL comedians can translate their comedy into versatile serious roles like certain legends. This trend of comedians trying to go serious is getting to be tiresome imo.Story wise, it's actually serviceable for the most part aside from forced biased propaganda that was inevitable with Rock involved, especially in this insane day and age. The plotting is rather predictable but there are still solid thriller aspects that are digestible and it has some vibrant suspense toward the end. Some twists and turns keep it interesting and familiar enough though I personally couldn't take the killer's disguised voice seriously either. Sam Jackson is always enjoyable and Max Mingella brings solid support.The real standout and somewhat saving grace for the film is the directing from Bousman who also directed Saw 2/3/4. He creates a visceral environment full of colorful settings, relentless brutality, and crisp camerawork overall. He's a director that has shown some serious potential and a keen eye for horror.Overall this is a passable spinoff that offers some new bloodshed in the franchise, yet suffers extremely from Rock forcing a serious role. I'd even go as far as saying if they got a more proper actor for the main role it would've elevated the film drastically. It doesn't break any new ground but has enough to keep fans intrigued and Bousman seems to have the ability to still keep the franchise going.","6","tresm87"," Chris Rock didn't ""wanna play a game"" with his failed attempt at a serious role, but a spiraling story, Darren Bousman's brutal directing makes this a passable spinoff.

I hope there is a direct sequel to this one day that connects with Jigsaw (2017).Only gave it 7/10 because I miss Billy and John's voice and some small hopes or expectations of cameos from past characters, other than that the story was thrilling and the traps gorey as always!","7","natashialw"," Loving this!!!

With his outrageous facial expressions and high pitched voice that didn't match any of his emotional expressions. It's clear to see that this movie was just some killings and a predictable yet effective plot twist.Overall terrible job, I damn near walked out the theater half way through the film.

"2013","Am I dreaming? How much did he influence (read: pay) the franchise to take part in it? Are there any sane producers that thought: ""yes, casting a guy renown for comedy is a splendid idea."" Is it the connected Hollywood machine rearing its ugly head? It's hard to take the actor serious, despite him trying very hard. Even bolstered with comedic script lines. The real comedy is that Saw of all franchises is greedy enough to do stunts like that. Using the original saw music and homage does not do anything. The Emperor's New Clothes come to mind. I guess all the original writers and staff left and these are the scraps they throw to whatever is left of the Saw audience nowadays.","5","tim_d3"," Chris Rock? Seriously?

"2014","""I don't see no Gump 2"" lol. Good to see horror creeping back into the cinemas, been a while since torture porn was on the big screens. This film was fairly enjoyable with a different angle on the franchise. For better or worse we follow the detective's story instead of just being thrown in a room with a bunch of victims. But, this is also where the problem is - the story is incapable of reaching the psychological thriller it tries to hit (like Se7en), so it sometimes feels weak and almost offensive to the viewer's intelligence.Looking beyond that, the film balanced that out with basically a ""stand-up"" platform for Chris Rock's comedy, which I was probably laughing a bit too loud in the cinema. The practical FX looked great, though the kill scenarios could have been better. It's better than the Jigsaw film which was a disappointing end to the franchise for me. Go see it in the cinema, because every ticket sold will give birth to future horror films to come to cinema.","7","JoelChamp85"," Not Intelligent But Worth The Watch

"2015","I must be a glutton for punishment ( no pun intended) as I've now watched all 9 SAW films. The original was great , some were ok and others were awful .This , although not strictly a Jigsaw movie , comes under the ok barrier .Working in the shadow of his father, an esteemed police veteran , brash Detective Ezekiel ""Zeke"" Banks and his rookie partner take charge of a grisly investigation into murders that are eerily reminiscent of the city's gruesome past. Unwittingly entrapped in a deepening mystery, Zeke finds himself at the center of the killer's morbid game.This has all the hallmarks of a Saw movie but really isn't as the story revolves around a copycat killer but that's ok . There is only so many times Jigsaw can come back from the dead !The plus's point of the film is that it stars , Chris Rock who is actually pretty good although it's strange not to see that distinctive smile. Not even once.The story is predictable and plods along fine and we get to see the inventive forms of torture we have come accustomed to and these are particularly gruesome.I must admit , an hour in, I was drifting off a bit . I was getting a little bored but thankfully it's only ninety minutes long which is more than enough .I'm sure it won't take me long for this to drift from my memory and be just another of Saw series .Unremarkable.","6","valleyjohn"," Nothing new here

"2017","The 2000s were a strange decade for Horror, and while there was no shortage of quality outings, standouts included increasingly preposterous sagas like Saw and Paranormal Activity. The little home-grown movies that could each grew into those Horror parodies you see in children's cartoons. The most unlikely of superstars, Chris Rock, has now collaborated with Lionsgate and director Darren Lynn Bousman to jumpstart Saw with a revival that has some back to basics thrown in. 'Spiral' is trying to be for this franchise like 'New Nightmare' was for A Nightmare on Elm Street in the 90s- and it halfway succeeds. It may just be on par with the original installment in terms of creativity and thematic links to David Fincher's 'Seven', and there's certainly no contest between this and the Red Bull fueled froth that came in between- but it's also ham-fisted to a fault.It should be no surprise nowadays when a comedic actor or creator reinvents themselves with Horror or Drama (Jordan Peele, Craig Mazin with 'Chernobyl'), so Rock delivers as Det. Zeke Banks with sincerity. With his manifesto from years back comes a slew of humor that appeals to a more diverse audience. Samuel L. Jackson as Zeke's father/retired police chief is entertaining and scene-chewing as always. He's however not in this film as much as you might be led to believe, giving more room for Rock to steal the show.Its injections of comedic relief are cringey at times, but certainly a cut above the worst moments in 'It: Chapter Two' and some of the Marvel installments. The direction and production values are also at times noteworthy; with the sepia-toned, heat wave induced big city and its urban atmosphere help breathe new life.However the direction also comes a good amount of the typical Saw schtick- high-pitched jump scares and gimmicky editing. Many trailers aren't as bad as a number of cinephiles make them out to be, but here's an exception. The first trailer show a level of nuance in maneuvering suspense much better than the final product: because much of the dialogue is clunky, shouty and almost incapable of understatement- save for the final twist that pays off many of the themes and imagery set up throughout. They also mirror our more socially conscious country, and the roles of good and bad cops (guess what the dead pigs that Jigsaw used to use is brought back as symbolism for). It's a very 2020 Horror film and probably not as clever as it could be, but the final twist and elements in between may just as well be the next best thing for this dinosaur franchise.Grade- 2.5 out of 4 stars.","7","huntersmithx"," A somewhat refreshing but disjointed affair.

"2018","I've seen every SAW movie. I liked the first spin-off, JigSaw. This one has potential, but the Who-dunnit aspect and such was a bit cliche and not very impactful. JigSaw really had a shocking ending, this one wasn't quite as shocking. Part of it was the 'twist' only works because the screenplay lies to the audience, so the reveal felt flat this time around and less, 'omg how didn't I see that coming?'. The music, acting, and production quality wasn't too bad, but the story rushes along. This series feels more brief and small and less grand despite the decent actors. I wasn't very disappointed, just quite underwhelmed. They spent 40 million dollars on this? I never would've known. I really recommend seeing this for free instead of paying. It's just not that special. A decent cliff note for the series nonetheless.","6","influxtwo"," From the Book of Sigh.

"2019","I was excited when this movie opened with an awesome trap, shown in a perfect way with close-ups at first before finally revealing the entire thing, similar to how someone who is regaining consciousness might experience it. Then we delve into the new tone if the movie, which i also liked. Same with the chris rock comedy. The setup was good, and the story was intriguing.But it did not culminate into anything of note and ranged from mediocre to disappointing for the second half of the movie. The traps were okay, and i feel like there were only four of them. And to make it worse, for two of them they let you know the player didn't survive before showing you the trap, which defeats the purpose and removes the tension.All in all, i liked the idea and the new tone, and i didn't have a bad time with the movie. I will probably give it another chance. And i would be curious to see a continuation of the story. But imo, this is worse than any of the original 7, and on par with jigsaw (part 8). And this is almost exactly what i said about jigsaw (1 viewing, 5/14/2021)SPOILERSthe most disappointing part about this movie is that i guessed the reveal. Guess isn't the right word. I knew who the killer was at about the halfway point and never waivered after that. This has never happened to me with any of the previous 8 movies, even sometimes on second viewing. Maybe it's more difficult to surprise a seasoned fan of the series. But that argument can't be used when the first 8 repeatedly surprised me. And it wasn't even clever.","5","FeastMode"," not bad, but also not good

"2021","Spiral: From the Book of Saw is an excellent new addition to the Saw franchise. Everything was improved on. From the locations to the traps, it's amazing. Series veteran Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw 2, 3, 4) directs this film and was a perfect choice to come back and take the helm again. Jigsaw (2017) writers Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg return to write. Combining Darren with the writers was a great choice. They keep elements that made the films iconic and changed it up. New puppet, voice, etc. With all these new changes and seeing how it all played out, I'm really excited to see where this all leads next. All in all I'd say this was worth the wait.

"2023","Spiral: From the Book of SAW isn't like the previous SAW films so don't expect to hear the iconic JIGSAW voice as seeing this is a copycat killer who's targeting corrupt cops and unlike other SAW films this movie has a decent amount of comedic moments which some might find annoying or hilarious depends on how open your mind is but as this movie is a Spinoff.But if you're a true fan of the series then you will definitely enjoy this movie like even with the funny moments there is a lot of moments where it was very violent and I can't complain about it the gore was realistic good and also the traps were so beautiful and sick as with every other SAW filmThe music oh yes the music was also very good and Charlie Clouser did come back to help with the iconic music.So I definitely rate this movie a 10/10 I do recommend it for sure and I hope you all enjoy the movie.","10","NuikopeaDemon"," Bloody Amazing and Worth The Watch

"2024","Didnt have a great story like the original, didnt have a character that grabs you like jigsaw. Ending was weak and the ending saw twist was now where near as good as most saws. Sorry Chris but didnt like you in fargo and didnt like you here. It might just be me maybe seeing him as a stand up comic to much, but his acting delivery seems the same as his stand up. And his presence just doesn't transfer into drama horror or him being a tough guy. Was ok once but not theater or bluray worthy, it's a Netflix or cable watch film.","5","joiningjt"," Sorry didnt buy chris rock as a tough cop, story was mediocre ,We Missed jigsaw!!

"2025","A really great way to start the series back up again. I could've used more traps, but overall it was a great movie. Chris rock brings a bit of comedy to the serious movie. And the twist at the end was really great.","7","jamesmjohnson-03371"," Best one since Saw II

"2026","The rhythm of the plot was fast and devoid of real emotions. The use of the camera in some moments is absurd and abuses cheap tricks. It is obvious who is responsible after 20 minutes and it is ridiculous how they try to play with the protagonist. By the way, lousy update for Chris Rock, and unfortunately for Samuel L. Jackson, it seems that if it's not Tarantino, they don't know how to guide him.","3","ignacio-lopezmoreno"," Disrespectful with the saga and horrible performances

"2027","Whilst it's very generic, has some terrible flashbacks and isn't that scary, Spiral: From the Book of Saw is good gory fun that's funny, disturbing and surprisingly relevant. Chris Rock gives a great lead performance and Max Minghella, Marisol Nichols and Samuel L. Jackson are really good. Darren Lynn Bousman's direction is also really good but a few stylistic choices feel outdated. The music by Charlie Clouser and the soundtrack are both good.","6","masonsaul"," Good gory fun

"2028","This movie had all sorts of problems. Some we can expect from the Saw franchise. Lazy storyline. Wooden acting. Awful characters. Huge plot holes. Predictable twist. This movie even throws you with a bad voice on the ""I want to play a game"" recording. All that can be forgiven. However, this movie severely lacked creativity for the traps. Except one really cool trap. And while some traps in the past have been over the top and ridiculous, the creativity that went into them was fun and exciting. You could even feel for the characters stuck in the traps. Have that tense feeling of will they, won't they get out? This version of Saw, felt rushed. Too easy. They didn't feel like Saw traps. It almost felt like the Asylum version of Saw traps.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","Hungspun"," Of all the faults, only one disappointment

"2029","First off, I've been a fan of the Saw franchise since 2009. Ever since I've probably seen each one of them at least a few times. So when I heard about this film in February 2020 I got super pumped for Spiral. That was until it's inevitable delay to May 2021. I still did not give up hope. I knew they would come up with an amazing story that would satisfy Saw fans and possibly invite new fans to the franchise.That's brings up to May 13th, 2021. One year later. Was it worth the wait? The short answer: HELL YES!!It is one of the best Saw movies in the franchise. Top 3 easily in my opinion. Darren Lynn Bousman did an amazing job directing this one after Saw II, III, and IV. The atmosphere in this film was great with the shades of yellows and blues in the frame were a nice change in pace from what we're used to. The story was fantastic. Chris Rock holds his own in a horror/thriller movie so hopefully that kills any doubt you had that a comedic actor such as himself couldn't make this work.Don't get me wrong, while this movie looks and feels like a Saw movie, it stands apart in many ways. This is very much inspired by Se7en especially when dealing with the aftermath of the victims. The buddy cop element is present as well giving a new way for the franchise to add some depth to its characters. Chris Rock and Max Minghella play well together as Zeke and William respectively, bouncing banter off each other making for some funny comedic moments.The traps were simple and brutal just the way the original Saw was although much more bloody and graphic. Not over the top like some of the last few Saw movies. The concepts behind them were very inventive and added more purpose to the story even. So if you're a gore fan there's plenty for you to marvel at.There's plenty more I can say about how great this movie was. It is Saw like you remember with an extra Se7en-inspired heart. I cannot recommend this movie more. Congratulations to Chris Rock, Max Minghella, Samuel Jackson, Marisa Nichols, and Darren Lynn Bousman. Can't wait to see it again soon!","10","axfan64"," Spiral: The original Saw you remember and Saw like you've never seen

"2030","I think some people went into this movie expecting to see the Mona Lisa. Relax. This is a Saw movie for crying out loud. And it's a pretty damn good one. The plot is solid from beginning to end and the traps are simple but brutal. It's very entertaining the whole way through. The minor downsides were that there was some overacting every once in a while and it wasn't too hard to figure out who the killer was. It doesn't take away from enjoying the movie though. I enjoyed Chris Rock's character very much. My advice for this movie would be to just relax and don't have ridiculous expectations for it. If you do this, you'll have a good time.","10","rclakers"," Some People with Negative Reviews need to Relax lol

"2034","Spiral, the next chapter in a saw franchise that started out so promising under the steady direction of James Wan, but has since resorted to Darren Lynn Bousman again who handled it with much less finesse. The script could've used pretty much a complete overhaul. The dialogue consisted of continuous screaming and cussing for no apparent reason. The camera work was pretty chaotic, I think he used too much shaky cam and maintained a tone that made the movie unenjoyable. You could tell the movie was high budget due to the quality of its set pieces and effects, not to mention the two A list actors. The funny thing is, I think that they were both miscast. I'm sorry, but Chris Rock in this type of movie just didn't do it for me. He was whiny, angry, and his performance lacked the depth I was expecting. As for Samuel L. Jackson, I've never been a big fan of the majority of his performances (Except for Pulp Fiction of course). The kills were pretty inventive, with plenty of gore as Saw fans have come to expect. I probably won't ever watch this movie again, but it was fun being in the theatre. Overall, I'd say it's one of the weakest entries in the franchise.","4","JackCowart34"," Yeah, I got my hopes up too high for this movie.

"2037","When was the last time you saw a movie that everyone was excited to continue talking about afterwards? And that you and multiple friends woke up thinking about? ðŸ˜³
Spiral feels like more than just a return to form for a franchise, it feels like a horror movie being made by masters of their craft, that want to remind you
that this genre can stir you up like no other, and it really does leave you with... feelings.The traps are disgusting - they left me
more uncomfortable than previous traps, but that's not just because of what they did but the amazing performances leading up to them, especially Chris Rock, who I quickly forgot was Chris Rock. That's not something I expected, and nor was a great supporting cast around him. There's no dead wood here, and that's also true of the pacing, which is smart and slick and modern.

"2041","When I teach intro to film again, I will use Spiral (subtitled ""From the Book of Saw"") as an example of thriller and revenge themes coupled with torture porn. At least I know the Gitmo operatives will enjoy it. But like that real life torture chamber, the Saw series just won't quit.Nothing is creative about the formulaic nature of the film although the father/son dynamic gives it a bid for the unusual. As for the torture, the Saw series (this in the 9th?) has been exemplary for creative variations of torture.Most especially this iteration with the Dantean punishments fitting the crime. One ring of this hell, for instance, has the cop victim losing his tongue most horrifically for having lied regularly on the stand. In another, a victim can bypass electrocution in a tub by allowing a machine to rip off his fingers!The Jigsaw copycat certainly has Jigsaw's flare for the macabre while Chris Rock playing homicide detective Zeke Banks underperforms as the only decent cop in sight heading the investigation into the sick murders of the men and women in blue. Samuel L. Jackson as his dad and former chief of police is just Jackson reprising his bad-ass persona from a hundred other movies.After absorbing the variations of torture, you might notice this is just a conventional and unremarkable police-as-corrupt thriller. But then, Rock is a producer, so like the Jigsaw imitator, he allows the series to live again. Or die, if I can predict the drift of critical reviews.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","jdesando"," The Saw series has now officially spiraled out of control.

"
"2043","If you're going to see this movie because you heard Samuel. L. Jackson is in it or for some reason you want to see the voice of Marty from Madagascar in what looks like a cop drama; this isn't the movie for you. This is a movie made for the original fans of the films and when I say that I mean the viewing experience between those who haven't seen the originals, those who have seen the originals but don't like Saw and those who love Saw will be drastically different.Which is why I suggest that if you're going to see Spiral, watch the originals first. Story wise it doesn't really connect at all with the original other then the occasional reference to John Kramer and the fact he was the original Jigsaw killer but other then that this is it's own movie. The reason I suggest you watch it because of the way the narrative is written and how it unfolds. I would say Spiral is a Saw movie, but clearly as the description shows; it's a revival of the series.The traps still unfold the same way thematically throughout the film somewhat but it's the films final 10 mins or so where it really shines as a Saw film. Yes, the plot twist was predictable and the supporting characters were 2D and unimaginative but the story does well to really make you side with the villains in this. Just like 10 years ago when Saw fans low key understood John Kramer's reasoning and respected his art.Now for the cons of the film: Chris Rock's acting is subpar at best and I could not stop seeing Marty from Madagascar throughout the film.The plot twist was predictable although I liked it all the same.There were one or two scenes from a narrative perspective that I would've changed to different points in the movie to to make the plot more interesting.Finally, the 21 Savage theme 'Spiral' is god awful and It's stuck in my head. It tries to remix the original theme and just does a woefully terrible job.All in all though regardless of the above I praise this movie because I could clearly see they made it for the fans, not for all audiences. Yes, it's rough around the edges but what Hollywood needs during covid now is to invest in their fan base and not satisfy all audiences. Companies like WB in particular need to look at this and learn otherwise their Fantastic Beasts franchise is going to flop worse then their Justice League franchise did.I would really like to see this story continue in someway as I'm really invested in the villain and his motives. I also think that baring some things this film was written and story boarded well and it was nice to see some enjoyable comedy in a Saw film for a fresh change.","8","ollieharrison-76586"," A love letter to the fans of Saw!

"2047","You would have figured this long from the last Saw film (4 years?) someone would've come up with a good story that might have what most of the prior films lacked, but none of this has happened with the newest version, Spiral. After reading a lot of the reviews here I think many have forgotten what made the first film so great, and it was all the torture scenes. Creating the torture scenes is the easy part. Give yourself 10 minutes and you can create a good one yourself. On the other hand the twist? The twist in the first film was genius and they've been trying ever since to come up with something close, but they failed big time with this one. Yeah the film was really gory. Like we didn't expect that. Not only was this film missing the best element it also veered too far off the path for my taste. We all knew there would have to be a new killer, but why is he killing? Is he killing for a similar reason that Jigsaw did? Instead this film is more like your typical revenge flick. Not only that but it was waaaaay too easy to figure out waaaaay before we were supposed to. They totally underutilized Sam Jackson in the film and should have instead to find a way for him to have more time on screen. Big mistake. The acting was slightly better than most of the sequels, but definitely not any better to make any difference. The entire film felt lazy to me.I think that worst part might come near the end when the killer reveals all. If you think about what the person said you should realize that they could have accomplished the same a lot easier than the round about way it was designed. Like Nike say 'Just do it!'.Somewhere out there there's someone who could write a great new version of Saw, but Josh Stolberg & Pete Goldfinger aren't 2 of them.Of course the film ends where the viewer is left thinking there could be another, but I guarantee that won't be happening.","5","Farshnoshket"," Not worth anyone's time

"2048","So I've been into Saw since the very first film released when I rented it at my local Blockbuster Since then, I've seen every film in theaters.Despite being swept away by the current hype of each film, and my younger less developed mind, I claimed each subsequent sequel as the best entry in the series.After the series ended, and by the time 2017's 'Jigsaw' rolled around, my firm stance was that the first two Saw films are the only truly good ones through and through.Nonetheless, I went into Spiral really looking forward to it. There were many reasons to expect it to be promising... bringing Darren Bousman back as director, a great cast, promising teaser back in 2020 and I was very stoked.After seeing the movie last night, I was severely let down, mainly due to the writing.Before I talk about my negative feelings with Spiral, I do acknowledge that it's better than the past few Saw sequels... yet that's not really a high bar at all, thus the problem.The story was so paint by numbers, and the ending twist should have been so much more... just like ""Jigsaw"", even more so actually, because Spiral had a complete fresh slate to do whatever they wanted, and they chose a twist ending that was so bland and anti-climactic...Spiral ignored like Twist-Ending 101 --- there was no subverting of expectations, no multi-layered twists (a la Saw 2), no surprise reveals, misdirection etc...
Instead of having William as the killer, they should've had him be a red-herring , and do something like simultaneously revealing that William was just a pawn like Zepp or blackmailed maybe, introduce the real killer while having a time twist be revealed...They should have executed the twist in a clever way that pleases fans of the early Saw films like Saw 1 and 2, while also pleasing newcomers.For example, the killer is targeting cops, they could have found a way to have Daniel Mathews (Erik Knudsen) be the killer... or maybe the drill chair test survivor from the first Saw... maybe Daniel is targeting corrupt cops because he hated his dad and the emotional neglect he put him through, and they could execute it in an epic way that would be like epic on its own if you've never seen any Saw movies, but twice the epic-ness if you know who Daniel Mathews is!And then an epic time twist or something, reveal the bathroom or the Saw 2 house in an epic way. I really thought this film was going to take place around the time Saw 2 took place or something, or have some connection to the first two films.They should really loosely follow the blueprint of the original Saw for the main story, like two (or three) people trapped in a room and that's the main plot of the story like the Bathroom in Saw 1, and have a twist ending like Saw 2 - misdirection, time twist, unexpected killer etc.And just the overall story was terrible, Josh Stolberg (the writer), holy smokes... why the studios didn't think to look elsewhere for a new writer/s is beyond me. Jigsaw was dogsh**, so they cleaned house and got a new director and cast, studio wanted a new direction with the story along with Chris Rocks idea, so it's dumbfounding that they kept the same writers as 'Jigsaw'. Horrendously insulting story and dialogue, and twist.Overall, I still rank Spiral higher than everything past Saw 3. Not a huge compliment.","5","lionvanslion"," Spiral retreads over same dull path.

"2050","Chris Rock makes an unlikely appearance as both write and star of the ninth Saw entry, and his contributions breathe new life into a tired franchise. Chris Rock and Samuel L Jackson essentially play themselves, but their comedic quips don't detract from their believable participation in the cop-killer mystery. In fact, their comedic chops lend well to the campy ridiculousness inherent to the Saw series.Chris's story is also very in line with Saw's typical social commentary, and the twist villain is very fitting for the film. While not a perfect movie by any means, Spiral is a fun, welcome entry to the horror franchise and leaves me hopeful for even more future entries with the same amount of love put in.","7","codylbrowne"," A refreshing take on the Saw franchise

Director: Darren Lynn Bousman
Starring: Chris Rock, Samuel L Jackson, Max Minghella, Marisol Nichols etc
Overall rating 84/100Spiral from the book of saw is about a criminal mastermind believed to be a copycat of Jigsaw, and a police officer working in the shadow of his father. Him and His rookie partner take charge in a grisly investigation into murders eerily reminiscent of the cities gruesome past. Zeke (Chris Rock) finds himself at the centre of the killer's morbid game.I have to say I thought Spiral from the book of Saw was brilliant. I thought the cinematography was amazing and very creative. The camera work was really interesting and made the traps more effective. The gore was very effective, although I wouldn't advice eating much before seeing the film. I thought the movie had a nice amount of humour which made a nice change. With some great dialogue and a well constructed and thought out script. The set up for the main character was good. The performances from Chris Rock and Samuel L Jackson were great and they both had great chemistry together. I thought the jumpscares and building of tension was very effective. I loved the mystery and the mind games with the villain. With clear motivations set out, that despite being twisted you could kind of understand and see their reasoning behind their actions. The traps were very effective and creative, although some I admittedly struggled to watch. I liked all the connections between the victims. And the plot twists and final act was insane, I definitely want a sequel.The movie was flawed though, there was some lack of explanation into certain character conflict and some of the conflict felt unnecessary to me. I thought that there was some slight overusage of flashback and exposition in places, but I have heard the whole franchise does this. I also thought the film made it too predictable to find out who the killer was. And finally, I also thought the movie had a slight missed opportunity to go deeper with the themes of the corrupt police force and only touched the surface with highlighting some of the issues but didn't go deep enough.So overall, Spiral had some slightly annoying creative decisions. And made it slightly too obvious who the villain was, whilst also being about 10 minutes too short. But as a whole, was an extremely effective horror. With fantastic visuals, a very clever and well constructed plot and villain. That constantly has you stressed out and on the edge of your seat. Whilst also balancing its different tones well and still feeling like a saw movie but with a new twist.","8","rnixon-15663"," Spiral: From the book of Saw

"2053","The Good- Firstly, I really enjoyed the mystery element of this film, not really knowing what's going on or who is behind everything that's happening, that really intrigued me. I also thought that the film found very clever ways to show of the traps and situations that our characters are in. Chris Rock was very entertaining to watch in the main role, I didn't think I would enjoy seeing him as a detective but he really surprised me.The Mixed- Now Samuel L Jackson's character is very important to the film and script and he is connected to everything, however he doesn't have lots of screen time. If you are expecting lots from him, you'll probably be disappointed.The Bad- Straightaway we have seen these types of characters and films before, the rogue detective and charismatic villain has all been done before. Finally I thought the final twist was fairly predictable. There was one scene where the film was basically telling you what the final twist was going to be and that sort of cheapened the moment for me.Overall I'm going to give Spiral: From The Book Of Saw a 7/10.","7","ryanwesthamfan"," Nice Addition To The Saw Films

"2054","Released: May 14th, 2021
Viewed: May 19th, 2021Horror films these days have become something other than horror films. We have pushed the envelope so far on the serious violence subject that the movies themselves aren't really scary anymore, just kinda' gross. Because of TV shows like CSI (2000 - 2015), the Walking Dead (2010 - Present), the age of streaming services making it easier for access to R rated content and changing attitudes on violence in movies/TV shows, we have come to a point where we have seen everything. I mean really, how many different ways can you mutilate the human body? Plus, knowing that it is fake (not criticizing the effects in some of these films), and with all that Hollywood magic thrown in, also makes it easier not to be scared.We have come to a point where horror films need other angles to make them appealing today. So, for me, my angle was concentrating on the very interesting idea of seeing Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson being serious in a slasher/gore film. Of course, Samuel L. Has done plenty of serious work, but it was the idea of Chris Rock taking on a serious role, that I've never seen before. The closest, serious, dramatic role I've ever seen him in was probably, Lethal Weapon IV (1998). What is even more intriguing is the fact that Rock plays Jackson's son in this film.Rock plays Police Detective Zeke Banks, who's father once was a legendary Police Captain, who was busy hunting down Jigsaw during the old Saw days. On the day Banks gets a new partner (Max Minghella), fellow detectives of Bank's start disappearing and falling prey to a new copycat killer named Spiral. A pretty basic plot, but it does deliver a few surprises and turns.What it didn't do was scare me. I didn't flinch at all and this film had plenty of the cheap, flashed, jump-cuts for fright purposes and those weren't working either. As I said earlier, horror films are not scary anymore, just cartoonishly gross and silly. I am not criticizing the effects in this film, because they are good and convincing when looking at them from a creative and designed point of view. When it comes to frights, this one needed to use it's next best cards to make this film enjoyable.That card falls to the performances of Chris Rock and his supporting cast, who all do a pretty good, convincing job. In the case of Rock, it's almost weird watching him do a serious Chris Rock, but with a gritty edge that was very cool, fresh and likeable. He wanted to tell us that there was no time for comedy, only serious stuff. Samuel L. Jackson does what he does well. He executes the qualities and attributes of his character needed to sell it to an audience, And, he does it without over-doing it. What makes him so good is his ability to simplify the issue, because an energetic, amplified personality like him could fall prey to over-acting, but Jackson gets the job done again.The rest of the cast is a cast of virtual unknowns, who do a good job, but deflate some of the energy in the room being generated by Rock and Jackson. The next biggest cast member after Minghella, is Marisol Nichols, who plays the current Police Captain. She manages to feed on the emotions of the audience. It was her character that helped generate the second guessing of where this story ends up.Go into this movie looking for suspense, a good murder mystery, fresh performances and a psychological thriller. Try and take the gore as flashy make-up effects and try to remember its all fake, so it doesn't ruin the rest of the film for you. I still consider a film with a 6 IMDB a good film and worth seeing, but I'd save your money and go to $5 Tuesday night instead of the regular theater price. I will say this though, Chris Rock was pretty good. I like his serious side.6.1 (D+ Mygrade) = 6 IMDB.","6","PCC0921"," Very Good Performances, Good Story, Convincing Effects, No Frights Though

"2055","The first Saw was a great film that featured a nice balance between mystery and suspense, and the blood and gore which I felt was overused in the franchise. What I enjoyed about this particular film was how it partially returned to the mystery detective roots of the first two ones. Spiral is not only a good addition to the Saw franchise for toning down the gore in exchange for mystery and suspense.The film is also a great satire on the modern problem of police brutality. Chris Rock's Zeke Banks was someone I could easily root for in the entire film. Despite delivering his usual comedic chops, Rock's Zeke was likeable from the start for being a dedicated officer willing to uphold the law, which made him my third favorite cop after Agent Peter Strahm and Detective David Tapp. The ending I definitely enjoyed. In keeping tradition with the last minute plot twists that come with the franchise, making Samuel L. Jackson's Chief Banks as a tritagonist was a nice touch.His character was someone I almost rooted for, for apparently being a crusader for justice like Zeke and being protective of his son. What I didn't expect was him being the one who encouraged his officers to break the laws they were supposed to upheld. The ending was a nice touch and homage to the first film. Watching Zeke feel helpless when a SWAT team accidentally gun down his father (as revenge by Zeke's partner for the death of his own) was a nice callback to the first film when Adam could only scream helplessly after losing the game.Overall Spiral is a welcoming addition to the Saw franchise and managed to concoct a good plot twist of tritagonists which Jigsaw (2017) was trying to pull.","7","edwincervantes70"," Formulaic, predictable, yet nevertheless a welcoming entry to the Saw franchise.

"2056","I am probably among the biggest Saw fans out there and I even loved Jigsaw to show you where I'm at in life ... So I think it's relevant information to mention this because of the amount of reviews from people who don't like the series (go away) or don't know anything about it. I come from a place of real admiration for the series so far though we all know Saw 3D and Saw V were real horrible.Anyway I was overall disappointed with this film overall. The big positive for me are the traps... and if I ranked them they would probably be in the order they appear in the film - from the first one being the best and the last one being the worst. I don't know if that is generally the order they were striving for but it is a high point of the film. Mostly creative, satisfyingly shot and specific to the characters being tested. The intensity is also turned up for me to 11 throughout the film.. especially being a Saw film. You're on the edge of your seat because you know the type of stuff you are in for in these films. Ultimately I was disappointed in what we got out of it... but I was engaged throughout. I have less of an issue with the acting than most people. The acting in the traps is on point, Chris Rock was a solid enough protagonist and the ensemble cast is adequate.I posed the following question to the person I saw the film with and I will to you .. if you took out the traps, you took out the Saw lore.. would you still have a good movie? My answer is an absolute ""No."" It is at best a police drama you would find on cable like NYPD BlueX A combination of poor dialogue, pacing concerns and an predictable ending has me believing without the ""Saw"" name this movie would never have gotten made. The characters outside of the main 4 in the billing are completely one sided and cardboard. You can't route for anyone in the film they don't want you to route for.I think we should expect more than this as fans and some day I hope we get it. 5/10... and I hope they make more :P.","6","nflshowdown2"," Saw...

"2057","The last two sequels of the ""Saw"" franchise were weak ones, but ""Spiral"" is a great one. The performances are cool, the script is fine but predictable, at the middle of the film you realize the killer identity, the cinematography is perfect, the direction is good and the gore is awesome. A cool horror-thriller.","8","jp_91"," Great sequel!

"2059","I enjoyed Chris Rock's portrayal of his character as an uber angry detective who had turned in a dirty cop early in his career and has been seen as a snitch by all fellow police ever since and he's none too happy about that. We're all use to seeing him in the comedic role so this was refreshing. That being said, he was not totally believable as an angry cop. You always have the sense that he was going to burst out laughing. There were a couple of believable ""angry"" moments but just a couple. I'm not necessarily a ""Saw"" person and enjoyed this iteration. The movie has its usual interesting and unique bloody scenes. I didn't see the ending coming and it kept my interest throughout and Rock's and. Jackson's performances were entertaining so it gets a 7.","7","hometuff"," Interesting, especially with a super pissed off Chris Rock

"2060","The movie of course is so promising .. all the gore content movie goers seek when seeing a slasher film is weaved perfectly into this movie. Samuel L Jackson delivers as usual and is truly my fav part of the movie!! However maybe I'm just picky but I hated the ending. It started to become really predictable and the ending wasn't something I wanted to happen so I don't recommend wasting your money on it, like I left the theater so pissed off about it. But if you happppppen to have time to waste.. when this becomes available to stream FOR FREE...., then go for it.. I guess.","3","garrettpeery"," Love Samuel L Jackson.. but that's about it

"2061","While the budget and production value has been boosted, the film has a major identity crisis. It is conflicted between being a detective thriller and a classic saw film. Constantly bouncing back and forth between those two concepts, fleshing out neither, and failing at both. Way too predictable and lack of rewatchability. Disappointing.","5","seanmills-90674"," Identity Crisis
"
"2062","Note: I haven't watched any other saw movies, so take this with a grain of salt.Off the bat some of the dialogue was just clunky and some camera work and sound effects were just downright funny. I am not very knowledgeable in horror or gore oriented films but I had no problem with most of the puzzle scenes. I took the most issue with the movie's message since it's weirdly both pro and anti cop and didn't leave me with any meaningful experience. Overall, just felt kind of devoid of message, which could be fine but the traps and suspense weren't good enough to make up for its lack of intent.","4","cindyxie-78638"," Just not a great experience story wise.

"2063","Too many plot holes and questionable decisions at odd times. The ending especially. There is so many other choices Chris Rocks character could have chosen. Just mind numbing. Good movie for background noise.I know what to expect from a saw movie. This is not a saw movie. I've been a fan of the series since the first part. Love how the six parts complete the story. They could have taken saw in a great direction from that point, but chose to try and reboot it. And the voice of jigsaw had me laughing on the inside. Not a bad movie. Just average.","5","alexkzapf"," A lot of promise, fails to deliver!

"2064","As with a lot of reviewers, I had high hopes for this movie since there was first talk of it. Can't verbalize how disappointed I am now that I've seen it.Each and every overused cop movie trope and cliche was used. Some more than once. Chris Rock had one expression the entire movie, which was a confused/angry/squinty grimace. Unfortunately, his acting left a lot to be desired, and I half expected him to break into a comic bit. His precinct associates were overblown stereotypes. Way too many instances of ""that wouldn't ever happen that way"" that I could not ""suspend disbelief"" for very long.The supposed connection to the actions of Jigsaw was so loose that I'm pretty sure you could remove that aspect of the story and it wouldn't make a difference at all.Not to mention you could figure the identity of the perpetrator from a mile away despite the dozens of red herrings thrown around, and the traps set didn't hold a candle to the earlier movies.Best part of the experience was getting back into a real theater, but finding a movie funny that is supposed to be scary and suspenseful was definitely a downer.","5","momster64"," Save your money..
"
"2065","When Chris Rock announced that he came up with a great way to revive the franchise, I was intrigued. A great idea to bring it back to life means that someone finally thought of an awesome premise to keep Lionsgate's cash cow grazing away as I'm sure all Lionsgate execs have been trying to think of ways since Saw VII.OK so let's imagine that the execs have been trying for 10 years to think of a good enough reason to dust off the traps. It obviously can't be something predictable. It wouldn't be the most predictable and over-used reason for reviving similar series, would it? I mean ""copycat killer"" must have been suggested around the writers' room ever since Saw VI and luckily we never got that in such a simple unimaginative way... until now.So let's try to look at it as the fresh take that Chris Rock intended and pretend that a copycat killer is a clever hook... Now the challenge is to create a few Saw-esque reveals and surprises to really essentially make you want to re-watch the movie. The only ""shocking"" reveal in the movie was extremely predictable - especially to torture porn Saw fans. This movie had very brief trap scenes which led to Zeke being sent body parts. Didn't they think that a body part being sent to Zeke without the viewer seeing the scenario play out for that victim would make Saw fans realise that they didn't actually see the death then ultimately assume that there must be a reason for that (otherwise why not show it?) and what better reason than because the victim never actually died? It just made it glaringly obvious who the killer was from that moment!Ultimately I can't see how anyone thought Spiral was a good enough idea to reboot the franchise. Although they wanted something fresh (I get it) I feel like they could have tied into the franchise further by using more than familiar music. Familiar sets or a motive linked back to the original movies would have been great. Why keep talking about 12 years ago if you're not going to link any of the story to events we've seen previously? The only clever nod we got was Zeke waking up handcuffed with a saw nearby and the the familiar Saw theme playing for the first time in the movie followed by him suspecting the victim in the middle of the room. With more nods like that, they'd have intrigued me more as a viewer whilst not alienating anyone who hasn't seen a previous Saw instalment.I just can't see how anyone thought this idea was amazing enough to justify flogging this dead horse! It's not a bad movie when compared to something like Seven but doesn't really hit the mark as a Saw movie. At all!","5","rheap-47304"," NO BIG IDEAS

"2070","I was excited what Chris Rock could do for a tired franchise, excited about a new concept and new direction... instead it's a lazy rehash, slightly buzzed by a modern killer cop addition, but instead of going deep on a new story or a new vibe it relies on the same tired heavy metal video editing, delighting in the torture like later additions did, but which the original never had to. The scary comes from the scenarios, a plausible way out for a questionably evil trapped person... but when the victim is unlikable and the choices are both just as bad, when it's always death or mutilation, that's not intense. The killer (no spoilers) is exactly who it has to be... ie there is no second guessing. I figured it out 30 min in because of lazy writing and editing that shows too much. Also, be sure to show every death scene... that is so annoying when one is missing. Like, duh.","3","actaction"," Awful, franchise low. Predictable, unoriginal & tired

"2073","Even given the quality and track record of the Saw movies, this was an awful attempt at a murder p0rn with a story.

It was a film made by a team of people who never met and couldn't agree on what the film was supposed to be. It felt like a high school play. Just awful.One of the worst things about this film is the assumption that you have goldfish-levels of memory, so nearly every scene contains a flashback to the scene before it.

"2075","Let's be clear, this is NOT the Saw of old. The torture scenes take a backseat to the police procedurals in this one; there's maybe 5 minutes worth of trap scenes and nothing is terribly bloody. Chris Rock actually did a really good job in this role. I think the trailer made it seem like he was overacting the whole time, but that wasn't the case. It was funny at times, but also a decent mystery. It was more of a slow burn that culminated into an epic finale. The final 10 minutes were super intense and exactly what you would expect from a Saw movie. Sure, you'll probably know who the killer is by the halfway point, but I don't think that's the only twist. There's so much more going on here that will be explained in future movies.**SPOILERS** like when the wife of the first cop that was killed said that there was a black SUV sitting outside of their house before he was abducted. And then when Rock goes to the church to investigate that one dude there's the black SUV sitting out front when they get in their car. I'm going to see it again to check out more things that I missed, but I think there are lots in motion that this first movie wasn't able to touch up on. And the only real problem I had was that the traps were more based on revenge than redemption. Go see it, but know that it's a different beast this time. It's a whole new story and you won't see any old characters return. For the best. I mean, Kramer's been dead since 2006, let it go and move on.

Number 1 is a classic, 2 is decent and this, number 3 is a really decent love child.The production and cast are excellent, Vera Farmiga I generally find a pleasure to watch, Patrick Wilson adds well and is comfortable in the role.The film has some good pace, and a decent story, helped as always by the tenuous link to a ""based on a true story"" which always adds to these films. I think it could benefit from the tradtional horror, ""no more that 1.5hrs"", and felt a little long and nearly 2 hours, but not overly under-edited.Overall if you are a horror fan, this will give you what you need, and I suspect will become a pretty popular, Horror in this excellent fanchise.Recommendation: Decent watch for Horror fans.","7","jasongkgreen"," Decent Follow Up..

"2087","After watching the 'The Conjuring: Devil made me do it' at an early screening last night, I have to admit I was a little disappointed that it didn't live up to the expectations of the previous two films in the main trilogy ( however it stands tall over the spin offs, so don't worry there).To start off with what I did like, the direction in this instalment is a nice change of pace. With the Warrens looking to save a man on death row after supposedly killing an individual while possessed by a demon. Without going into spoilers the plot shakes things up a bit from the previous two films with the likes of Satanic cults and more or a detective style approach.I personally would of loved to see more of a focus on the court side of the case and the reaction of the defendants plea, it would of been a really refreshing direction for this film but what we get still isn't bad.The Warrens are still great in this film with both Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga having a real chemistry on screen and still being one of the most lovable protagonists in horror media in a long time.However with all this said, I believe this 'horror' film does fail in one department, and that is in its scares.It's a shame to say as I believe the previous two instalments had some unique moments of terror.Whereas in this film most moments are so easily telegraphed to an obvious jumpscare that you can see a mile away, or more unique set pieces unfortunately spoilt by the trailers.With all that said, this is still a decent sequel, just not the terrifying sequel I had hoped for!","7","conn-57441"," A decent sequel.... without the scares!

"2090","After watching this I can safely say this is one of the better Conjuring movies. The quality was definitely above average compared to other Conjuring movies. The first exorcism scene alone had some amazing camera-work, effects and acting.It felt like the creators were a tad more aggressive with the scenes in this movie. Some of the characters get thrown around a lot more which does help make it feel a lot more authentic. Special mention to Julian Hilliard (who plays David) - he definitely has some pretty physical scenes and he did very well to make them feel authentic. Great bit of acting on his part!The story in this movie felt very polished and was portrayed well. It felt a lot more story-driven compared to other Conjuring movies, and had more depth compared to others too. The horror elements are the usual Conjruing-esque jumpscares with the occasional creepy and eerie scene which definitely grabs your attention. I must say though the effects used to show the exorcisms looked amazing. The body contortions were very well done and really creeped me out!Overall, an above-average addition to the Conjuring universe. Acting is great as always and a well thought out story really gave them the space to shine. No out of this world scares or anything like that (it's a Conjuring movie so you know what you're in for) but definitely worth a watch in my opinion!","8","LSUK"," An above average addition to the Conjuring universe!

"2091","The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is the third entry in The Conjuring film series (and the 8th part of The Conjuring Universe): Helmed by Michael Chaves, who directed The Curse of La Llorona (an earlier and less well-received spinoff). James Wan is a co-writer and executive producer for the first time so no doubt many critics will be keeping a keen eye on Chaves as he takes the series in a new direction.The story is based on the case of Arne Cheyenne Johnson, a young man who murdered his landlord and claimed that demonic forces made him commit the act. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson return as ghost-hunting supremes Ed and Lorraine Warren who set out to make sense of the case and prove that demons can and do in fact take possession of people whilst convincing the high court that supernatural forces can be used as mitigating circumstances.The formula for the third entry moves away from the haunted house tropes that drove the narrative of the first two films and veers towards the possession court room drama/crime investigation and witchcraft theme and as such the film feels fresh (how many more times do we really want to see Ed and Lorraine poke around old and dusty houses?). Wilson and Farmiga prove once again that their presence is what makes these films so enjoyable and watchable. Amongst the jump scares and deafening score they offer substance and an element of humanity that really makes you root for their characters. This time around we learn even more about the Warrens, how they met and how these cases affect them on a physical and emotional level. Farmiga as Lorraine Warren in particular is put through the wringer and takes centre stage. A phenomenal performer who can act her way out of a paper bag, she offers one of the best character drives in the series.After a particularly intense opening scene involving the exorcism of a young boy (with nods and throwbacks to William Peter Blatty's original Exorcist) complete with some body horror that would have Cronenberg wincing the story moves along swiftly onto the case of Johnson who believes that a demon is responsible for the downward spiral his life has taken. The same demon is alleged to have caused the possession of the young brother of his girlfriend and so Ed and Lorraine Warren are drafted in to solve the mystery. The set pieces are what you'd expect from The Conjuring universe, with the camera panning away in some dark and dimly lit basement or morgue before a big reveal that hits you square in the face like a crescendo. Unlike Chaves previous effort this one comes with greater care for the scares, with the tension mounted up to extreme lengths and therefore the payoff feel earned. The central performances also add a layer of craftsmanship which makes up for the cheapness of some of the earlier spinoff entries. Ruairi O'Connor gives a moody performance as Johnson and really captures the sense of dread and unnerving unknowing that befalls a character that faces a life behind bars if the burden of proof is not challenged. Alongside genre greats such as Wilson and Farmiga he more than carries the film when required to do so. The score from Joseph Bishara (who penned the score for both Conjuring films and Wan's other ghost spinner Insidious) is a powerhouse of orchestral greatness, with shrieking violins coming to life when the scares are meant to catch you off guard. The ingredients all form together to deliver yet another fantastic Conjuring film.If I had to give some criticism then the ending is a little slapdash and the resolve is a little sloppy and the final antagonist isn't particularly scary, however by that point most people will be entirely entertained so you are likely to still come away smiling (or screaming).","8","joe-collins91"," Nail biting suspense and in-your-faces scares makes this a worthy sequel

"2095","As I said, the film doesn't have the same power and unique feel as Wan's 2, but it is a nice continuation in the franchise with an intriguing story that does delve into the crime drama genre along with giving us the scares we come to know. You can tell Wan still was involved with certain camera works and scare concepts much like he was with the mediocre yet entraining curse of LaLlarona which this director Michael Chaves debuted on. While he doesn't fill Wan's shoes at all, he was able to follow a certain format for this particular franchise to move forward though at dragging pace at times.The actors are all very good as usual and the duo of Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as the Warren's are phenomenal bursting with emotion as always. They carry this film completely. The effects are decently executed and the cgi looks near flawless. Some of the scares are a mixed bag of ambition and some are tremendously cliche, but they all do their jobs for the horror aspect. The ominous settings are fantastic and add rich environment for the frights to flourish.Overall it's an effort that felt satisfying to see the premier franchise continue, but there's a definitive void without Wan's genius eye.","7","tresm87"," Without Wan directing it doesn't have that same detail and dynamic, but it does continue the Warren's adventures serviceably with solid story/scares.

All performances were great, they all did their best. There was a great creative scene which actually gave me chills, and there were some nice shots but only a few...What I didn't like was, the CGI was unfinished, it was awful to look at. Also there were moments that could've been better executed or better written, they just felt a little lazy and brushed over. I'll be honest out of all 3 films this is the least scariest one, no jump scare got me and the one thing that gave me chills was more of a ""Cool"" moment. I just wasn't scared, not even once. I also thought the direction was boring, James Wan added so much to the other two films with his directing talent, but this director... just felt like plain bread. James Wan should've directed this.Overall, I thought this was just fine, a cool interesting turn in events for the main characters, but lacking with any scares and boring bland direction made it the weakest of the three films.

"2101","Honestly, I landed on the film last night, browsing titles on Netflix, because of Lily James - having known nothing else about the film from before (I usually skip trailers these days), but that she was in the cast was a huge draw for me - and found immense pleasure in this gem of a film. From Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes to Ben Chaplin and Archie Barnes, the performances are all first-rate. The real-life story is told with great finesse, and filmed earnestly with a keen eye for production details. I have to say, even some of the lesser moments from the film shall stay with me for long, its appeal is that strong.","8","anisen-undefined"," First-rate performances and a gem of a film

"2102","An intriguing little piece of British history, The Dig tells a slow-burning story with understated and genuine drama throughout, turning what could have been a rather dry tale of archaeology into a genuinely gripping character drama. Its historical context takes a little while to become fully relevant, but ultimately, The Dig really proves itself as a captivating watch.One of the things that I really liked about The Dig was its patience. Never dragging yet never rushing, the film takes its time to build up all of its main strengths, from its characters, their emotional back stories, and the overarching historical context of the outbreak of World War II.Complete with elegant camerawork, a beautiful score and impressively atmospheric direction that makes it an eye-catching watch from the first few moments, The Dig has enough confidence and depth to keep you engrossed even if its story isn't advancing apace, something that's a lot harder to pull off than you may think.One of the big reasons that the film's patient pacing and style work so well is because of its understated, genuine drama. With calm yet fully convincing performances across the board, particularly from Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan, this isn't a showy period drama by any means, but eases you into a story about real people, making them the centre of attention far more than the historical significance of the event.I'm not particularly well-versed in archaeology, and I didn't know about this discovery before watching this film. I think that might be the case for many other people, but the great thing about The Dig is that it's primarily a character-driven drama, and one that uses emotional intrigue to bring you closer to the story at hand and allow you to appreciate its importance.One element where the film does seem to falter is in its use of the historical backdrop of the lead-up to World War II. Set in the summer months of 1939 before the outbreak of war, there are sporadic references to the coming conflict through the first two acts of the movie, but they don't seem to bear much relevance to this story about an archaeological find.However, the film slowly begins to unveil how the historical context plays into its characters' personal lives and the fate of the dig itself, with dramatic focus shifting significantly in the final act, but just at the right point that the sudden arrival of the war into everyday life feels just like what it would have been like to experience it first-hand, taking over everything seemingly normal in an instant.As a result, while the historical backdrop seems almost contrived at first, it really comes good as the film progresses, another demonstration of how the patience of The Dig really plays into its hands throughout.","8","themadmovieman"," An enthralling slow-burner that uses patient, understated character drama to fantastic effect

"2103","There are so many really good things about this movie, such a great piece of story telling.
The cast is excellent and all put in great performances, especially Lily James and Ralph Fiennes.
It's not just about an archaeological dig though, it's about past lives, present lives and how things are remembered in the future.
There are also several strands to the relationships between all invloved too, including working relationships, family relationships, class and secret relationships.
I don't know how much of the story is fiction or fact but it is well told either way. All this set with a backdrop of the coming second world war.

"2105","So rare to watch a wonderfully gentle but poignant film. It tugs at the emotions as it tells a largely true. Some liberties are taken with the truth but largely accurate. The real story of Peggy Piggott is fascinating and worth a film in itself. However the real stars of the story are Edith Pretty and Basil Brown portrayed brilliantly by Mulligan and Fiennes. One small criticism is that Carey Mulligan is too young for the part but she carries it off superbly and the performance by Ralph Fiennes is one of the best I have seen in a long time. The whole cast is superb and the backdrop of imminent war is ever present throughout the film. I have visited Sutton Hoo a number of times and studied the excavation and I still marvel at the work Basil Brown did. As an archaeologist myself I can say his work even by today's standards was of the highest order. Many of the academic archaeologists before and after WW2 were useless when it came to excavation and recording it. Basil Brown did everything right and it is fantastic he is at last getting the credit he deserved and that Edith Pretty wanted for him. It is to the great shame of the academic establishment it has taken so long. The film portrays this extremely well.","8","robertasmith"," A well written, acted and directed story

"2106","'The Dig' is a beautifully photographed period film (circa 1939, Suffolk, Great Britain) that seemed a lock to garner first Oscars for Ralph Fiennes (*overdue) and Cinematographer Mike Eley. Therefore, I'm instituting the 1st Annual ""Oscar Snub Award"" to the film most undeservedly left out of nominations. This year it was a no brainer - 'The Dig' wins and it wasn't close. So on with my original review B. S. (""Before Snub"")...Metaphors supporting Themes abound in 'The Dig' - ""life is fleeting"", ""the search for meaning in our lives"", ""our relevance in History"", and ""is this all there is"". Classic themes for dramas that are the eternal questions within our lives. The film intertwines those themes within the central characters, each conducting their own search for answers.The framework of the story occurs on the eve of WWII for Great Britain. The impending gravity of such hovers over the film, intensifying the characters' emotions and urgency in searching for answers to such questions - the telescope and magnifying glass used within the story serve as metaphors to that end. Collapsing walls of the dig site that almost takes Basil Brown's life illustrate the tenuous fragility of life which could end in a moment of randomness. There are many more such examples in 'The Dig'.Such poetic filmmaking takes painstaking attention to detail in production to pull off at the level achieved in this film. Utilizing the beautiful cinematography of Mike Eley and deft touch of Film Editor Jon Harris, Director Simon Stone succeeds in elevating the The Dig to an elite level of film art.This is without question the Best Picture of the Year, and I am thankful this beautiful film came in at the last possible minute to save an otherwise (and understandable) blah year in the film industry.Director Simon Stone's Oscar nomination for both Director and Best Picture is a virtual certainty.Ralph Fiennes (Basil Brown) never misses (except taking home an Oscar), but I predict he will FINALLY* be recognized by Academy members en masse for his best of the year acting in this film, along with Mike Eley for Cinematography.Carey Mulligan (Edith Pretty) should be nominated except she has two Oscar worthy films, both with a deserved good chance to take home an Oscar. Her spotlight lead part in 'A Promising Young Woman' has much more Oscar potential which will negate her role in The Dig - Mulligan should get Actress of the Year for putting forth two such great performances in one year!At the end of the night (Oscar night), 'The Dig' could sweep up wins in the aforementioned major Oscar categories for 2020 - I certainly wouldn't bet against it happening (EDIT: Boy was I wrong ð), and In terms of total Oscar nominations, this film sets up as the front contender for 2020. Then again, it could be a dodgy awards year - competition of last minute entries (is it going to get to the point where releases occur the day before the voting deadline?), and above-the-norm ""agendas"" abound in the industry these days.While the ensemble cast is highly competent, I don't see a particular supporting role having enough ""spotlight momentum"" to break-out and win an Oscar, although Lily James (Peggy Piggott) is a long-shot.If there was one weak point in the film, it would be the digression to the character Peggy that seems to be thinly integrated into the film. This hole in the film likely comes from Editing decisions, and will probably cost Lily James, Jon Harris (Editing), and Stone and co-writer Moira Buffini (Adapted Screenplay) Oscar nominations.The film runs under 2 hours, and it would have only required adding another 5-10 minutes to fully integrate Peggy into the story - Peggy is at a crossroads in her young life and her marriage to a man not interested in women forecasts a gloomy future - She gets sage advice from Edith Pretty (Mulligan) on seizing the day (and not to make the same mistakes she made).My advice to Stone is ""Don't start something without completing it"". My guess is there is extra footage on Peggy and perhaps a Director's-Cut extended version will be released at some point completing Peggy's story - I'd like to see that.ðð to all involved in 'The Dig' - the film is a treat for the eyes - the acting superior - production execution excellent - it is 2020's Best Picture by classic film making standards, despite being the biggest Oscar snub of the 2021 Academy Awards.Here's hoping ""agendas"" and politics are left out of recognizing the best in film arts. (EDIT: Clearly agendas are NOT left out based on nominations MIAð)* Ralph Fiennes sits atop my IMDb list of 'Best Actors Without An Oscar' (EDIT: and will continue to be atop the list for at least one more year - Note: At least Glen Close has a shot at graduating off my no-O","9","Instant_Palmer"," ""and the 2021 OSCAR SNUB AWARD goes to...""

"2107","Some nice performances here and the set-up for a great narrative about archaeology in pre-war Britain and the role that regular citizens played in scientific exploration, but something goes awry along the way. The second half of the film focuses on several plotlines that simply did not even exist in the first half of the movie. Something was clearly done here after the first draft of the screenplay. Were sections cut? Were characters added to ""spice it up""? We may never know, but the final product feels awkward though it's no fault of the cast here.","6","miclarke"," Well acted, but.....

"2108","This is a superb film that I could watch again and again.I've been to see the Sutton Hoo treasures many times and have seen the story told on TV from Blue Peter to Horizon so I was looking forward to this... but also slightly worried about it. Films on subjects like this can be either dry or trivial or triumphalist or worthy or just bad.But from the first scenes this film is beautiful. These is no other word. The outdoor scenes (and much of it is outdoors) is just breathtakingly gorgeous at times. This is Suffolk and wow does it look good. If anyone has seen the BBC series ""The Detectorists"" they will get the idea. It captures the big skies of East Anglia so well, sun through the early morning mists, or even after the rain like works of art. The stage on which the action is set is sumptuous.As for the action - its just so good. Almost dreamlike at times - I found myself thinking of ""The Go-Between"" (also set in Suffolk, of course!) with dialogue over the top of action that is not taking place at quite the same time. Hard to describe, but its like memories.Some of the film is a shade predictable - the small enthusiast verses the big guy, the mismatched couple and a possible tragic love story, the child's eye view at times, the repressed sexuality of the period - it's all there. But it is so well done.The only downside is that this film - this photography - deserves the big screen, but most people will now see it on the small. This is such a shame. Its deserved so much more.","10","johnbirch-2"," Beautiful film that took me by surprise it is so good

"2109","Ralph Fiennes plays the character beautifully and carries the movie for the first half. Alas, not enough to make it interesting.While the start is promising and portrays Basil's (Ralph Fiennes) passion and great work, halfway through the movie the storyline just switches. What started as an ode to Basil's work, the importance of the find and Mrs. Pretty's trust, quickly turned into a story a love story about two characters we hardly care about. Suddenly, Basil is nothing more than a sidelined character who's just kind of ""there"". Like the makers of the movie just decided to make a completely different film halfway through.I feel the movie does little more justice to acknowledge Basil's work than history has done by not acknowledging it. His importance and find have been overshadowed by a random love story we've all seen before in many other movies and to have sidelined the archeological find and Basil's importance for some cheap love story, feels wrong.","5","robinalers"," A story about nothing

"2110","I was excited to see a film that portrays 1930's England, and Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan are proven actors that bring a unique presence to their films. Archeology might be a tough sell for the premise of a film and it was these actors that drew me in. The first half gets it so right, it's just about the time period and characters digging while becoming excited as they unearth the past, it's rather simple yet these actors have no trouble keeping you interested. In fact it was refreshing to see English people presented on screen becoming excited over finding evidence of their ancestors and past to this ancient land given the current hostile attitude towards the English and Celtic peoples by particular political groups and media companies who like to remind us we have little culture and heritage.Then suddenly it's as if the writers thought viewers would become bored and in comes a new character, a rather modern-behaving ""liberated"" female with her controlling husband, inserted into the plot to remind us how women should really behave in the current age as if we needed reminding. The key characters become background noise, and you have this love triangle develop, the film takes on a different purpose, I'd rather see more character development between the man who discovered the relics and the museum trying to take credit from the little man.","6","Jimmycakes"," There was no need for the distracting love triangle.

"2111","We have had Netflix for quite awhile now. But I seldom watch it.
For nearly two hours myself and my wife were taken away from
this terrible pandemic and watched a terrific film about an archaeological
discovery made on the eve of the Second World War at Suffolk in eastern
England. Maybe some of the children or grand-children of some of
the thousands of American servicemen stationed at the airfields in this
neck of the woods will have been told what beautiful countryside this is.
And the film shot on location will show you that not much has changed to
the beauty.

The relationships between us and the people we love,the people we don't even know..heck between people in general and how it's important to a human being..but that comes with a misunderstandings and conflicts and this happening in a time of war and how that is affecting them..all this has been told in an amazing dramatic way of Brasil Brown who discovered and excavated one of the most important archaeological discoveries of all time of course with that being the main story.
The acting by Carey Mulligan was magnificent and Ralph Fiennes was the one for this role and their performance was the outstanding thing in the whole movie.
Another thing was good is the editing..they've done a tremendous job and it was really worth the effort to come up with something like this.
Although sometimes there are some side stories that you'll find yourself not that interested in them too much,and the storytelling could seem very slow at some points..also there's ups and downs like any other movie.

"2117","""The Dig"" (2021 release from the UK; 112 min.) reminds us at the very beginning that this is ""Based On a True Story"". We then go to ""Suffolk, England, 1939"" as Basil Brown arrives at the house of Edith Pretty. Turns out Mrs. Pretty has hired Mr. Brown to do some archeological work on her estate. Her young son excitedly asks Mr. Brown ""Are you going to dig upo the mountain?"". Mr. Brown, taking room and pension at Mrs. Ptretty's house, starts to dig and soon is working his way towards some intriguing finds... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is directed by little known Australian director Simon Stone (""The Daughter)"". Here he brings us a historical drama about what later became known as the Sutton Hoo treasure, one of the biggest archeological finds in British history. The setting of 1939 is pivotal in several ways: of course the threat of WWII is in the air, but even more important, the way of life in those days was just entirely different, and being in a remote English area (near Ipswich) only reinfornces that. So be prepated for a slow moving film, I didn't mind it one bit. Even more critical for the movie is Carey Mulligan's exquisite lead performance. Playing a person who is more than 20 years her senior in real life (Carey is 35, Mrs, Pretty was in her mid-50s in 1939), she does so with grace and style and presence. The role couldn't be more different from what Carey did in the recently released ""Promising Young Woman"", which was in my top 3 of the bests films of 2020. Ralph Fiennes is equally great as the excavator Mr. Brown. Last but not least there is a wonderful orchestral score by Stefan Gregory, who I must admit was previously unknown to me.""The Dig"" opened last weekend in select theaters for a short run before then moving on to Netflix. (Seems like every other new theatrical release these days follows that pattern....) Thankfully the film opened at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early Satruday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (exactly 5 people including myself). Never mind. If you are in the mood for a good ol' fashioned hisstorical drama featuring outstanding performances from Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (if you still can), on VOD< or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","7","paul-allaer"," Watch it for the wonderful performances from Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes

"2123","5/10 StarsThey tried to dress this movie up with world war 2 droplets but in the end it bombed. A story about a man and his hole just wasn't entertaining enough for me. Odd sequences of dialogue between characters while the characters were doing mundane things. Almost felt like the movie was just glitching at times.I found myself more interested in the start of world war 2 then I did the dig. Probably because after the first 45 minutes or so it seemed like they were pretty much done with the project and forgot that the movie had another 75 minutes of runtime left.The Dig is a previously untold real life story of an excavator (Basil Brown played by Ralph Fiennes) who is hired by a wealthy widow (Edith Pretty played by Carey Mulligan) dying of cancer, to dig up her land in hopes of discovering something historic before World War 2 shuts the country and project down.I'd say the biggest problem with this movie was they didn't make the dig itself important enough to the plot. There was little suspense nor was there much build up behind the story. The writers didn't do a good enough job describing why this dig was so important to the characters involved or history in general. They got caught in between making this movie about Basil Brown, who's credit for his discovery was lost in history and Edith Pretty, who was dying from cancer and wanted to leave behind a legacy for her son and family to be remembered by and the historical importance of the actual findings from the dig itself. They should have picked a lane and drove everything else around it.I did like the acting by the two main characters, Mr. Brown and Mrs. Pretty. They both were very intriguing characters in their own right. I just wish I could have had a little bit more from them and less from the side story love affair between 2 randoms that oddly enter the film halfway.I liked the soundtrack and the shots of this small town in England. I liked the aura they were building up as they incorporated scenes of England preparing to fight World War 2. Wish they would have played that urgency up more though. The impending warn in combination with the fact that you now have a character in Brown desperate to make a name for himself with limited time to finish what will end up being the biggest archaeological dig of his life who desperately needs the support and encouragement of a women in Pretty who's health is quickly deteriorating should have made for a good movie. And even though I think they executed it poorly, I still think The Dig wasn't half bad. Has its moments, especially within that first hour that I enjoyed.Overall I think this movie can be skipped but if you watch it until the end you probably won't be as disappointed as my review will lead you to believe. It will have its moments with the well acted characters. However you'll leave it wondering why they didn't execute the story better and probably find yourself to be just down right uninterested in what they did show.","5","RamseyReviews1"," Not a ""hole"" lot to like.

"2124","I was very much looking forward to this movie. The prospect of a film based on the discovery of Sutton Hoo, starring Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan, sounds like the perfect combination. And it starts out promisingly, with wonderfully rich period detail and stunning scenery. It becomes clear at once that this is a movie for the patient viewer, with its deliberate English dramatic pacing. Where it began to fall short, for me, is when it became apparent that there was going to be very little done with the fact that Sutton Hoo is perhaps the most significant archaeological site in Britain and its discovery and what was learned from it is an amazing tale. Some of that could have been woven into the narrative, just a bit. Otherwise, there was very little interpretive value in the film, and while it is a drama, the stories of the main characters, which are told with a bit of artistic license, are not very compelling or interesting. The side plots of minor characters even less so. The magnitude of the discovery, to me, was not successfully conveyed in this movie, which is a shame. In the end, it is a good British period drama with solid acting, adequate writing, high production values and beautiful cinematography, that just never quite gets to the point it should and could have. For folks who are not fans of British slow burn television, it will be mind-numbingly boring.","6","batfangruskin"," I was looking forward to this movie very much

It's actually illegal to not report findings to a museum because it's a national treasure, you *technically* don't own it, even if it's on your land.I enjoy the movie, I thought the storytelling was great.

"2129","'The Dig' is not really about archaeology; rather it serves as a backdrop for a quiet and poignant exploration of mortality and legacy at the turn of the second World War. However, the ultimate tragedy of the characters and the looming threat of a war in which we know thousands died overshadows any hope that can be gleaned from Basil Brown's insistence that we live on and we're part of something continuous. By the end of the film, it seems Edith Pretty was right in saying 'We die and we decay'.The subtle, intelligent performances from Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan and stunning cinematography from Mike Eley of familiar countryside made this film. Archie Barnes (who played Robert Pretty) also put in an impressive performance; his face is one I expect to see in British film in the coming years.What made this movie good when it could have been great was mostly down to a poor, unoriginal story decision. The romantic subplot was completely unnecessary and felt chiselled in, only adding runtime and pushing the balance of pacing to too slow. Some editing decisions were also not wholly effective, choosing to replace shots of dialogue, acting I should like to have seen, with wider shots of the characters and landscape while the dialogue played under these.This may seem like a more negative review, but this film really touched me. 'We all fail' (Basil Brown) will stick with me as the hard but nonetheless comforting lesson of 'The Dig'.","7","pjkend-11719"," It's not really about archaeology

"2130","First the good. Carey Mulligan and Ralph Finnes are both terrific. The stars are for them. They are two enormously talented actors. However, the material meanders. It's very much a run of the mill BBC pot boiler of the kind that Miramax trotted out twice a month in the early '90s, with very little to get you excited. The creatives seemed to have picked that up halfway through the script, so they added a completely inconsequential love triangle amongst the co-stars and saddled poor Lily James with some terrible situations and silly dialogue. Ben Chaplin and Lily James picking out sleeping arrangements sent me to the fridge for sustenance to bare me through the last 45 minutes. The stakes of the find at the center of the ""action"" are that Anglo Saxon civilization had attained cultural heights in Ipswich much earlier than previously known. That seems to be totally irrelevant to the protagonists. Moments of consequence, generally when Carey's characters take on the cultural establishment, mostly happen off screen. (Ran out of money? Ended up on the cutting room floor?) If the characters, the writers and the director don't care about the stakes, why should I?","3","schmidt-timothy"," Over-rated

"2135","Considering the potential of the source material, the classy cast, the accomplished writer and the skilful cinematographer, this is a dreadful mess of a film. Packed with cliched, sentimental fantasies about rural England between the wars; unfocused, with an irrelevant and historically fake romantic subplot tacked on as a crowd-pleasing afterthought; drearily paced ; low in energy; stultifyingly middle-class and devoid of any detectable purpose beyond a purely commercial one.. In places, it is laughably bad. You can safely give it a miss in spite of so many positive reviews. I am surprised that the brilliant Carey Mulligan is this desperate for cash.","2","ian_d_hoare"," Brought to you by the Netflix marketing department

"2138","The Dig (2021) was directed by Simon Stone. It stars Carey Mulligan as Edith Pretty. Mrs. Pretty is a widow who lives on a large estate. She is convinced that there's something of archeological significance on her property. She employ Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) to excavate one of the burial mounds. Brown is a skilled and experienced excavator, but he has no formal academic training. The result of his efforts can now be seen in the British Museum.This could have been a great movie, if director Stone had just worked with what actually happened. Naturally, staff of the local museum wanted to direct the excavation, as did staff of the British museum. There was an inquest to decide the ownership of the find. World War II was (literally) about to begin. A perfect 90-minute movie. However, it ended up being a less-than-perfect 105 minute movie.That's because director Stone brings in a (fictitious) cousin of Mrs. Pretty and a beautiful young female archeologist married to a stodgy , unromantic male archeologist. (Guess where that goes?) The inquest--an absolutely essential scene about who owns the find--is botched. You have to work backwards to figure out what happened. Worst of all, you never see the dramatic results of the excavation. You can see them in the British Museum, or online, or on a postcard. However, you don't see them in the movie. (Maybe the British Museum didn't like the movie, and refused to give permission.)All in all, what could have been an excellent movie turned out to be pretty good movie. It's worth seeing as long as you don't expect great things. It works well on the small screen. The Dig has a pretty good rating of 7.3. I agreed, and rated it 7.","7","Red-125"," They couldn't just trust the real story.

"2140","This film was visually beautiful with a rather simple, but very moving story. Also had some great underlying themes that stick with you. The acting was incredibly good too. Just when the story started slowing a bit, new characters were introduced and drew me right back in.I particularly enjoyed Lily James' character and the job she did to portray her. It's a smaller part, but adds a lot to the film.It was a treat to see on the big screen if you can find one, but otherwise definitely should be on your list to stream on Netflix (if not twice, at least once)!","10","mackks"," Beautiful and worth a watch!

"2141","The DigI enjoyed this movie overall but there were some problem areas that really irritated. In many way if was self-evident they were trying to aggrandise a really quite boring event, and the obvious insertion of some bizarre sub-plots was done to stretch it into a movie.The acting was comprehensive and Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan were really quite brilliant(and I not a fan of the latter after that terrible body part movie, Never Let Me Go). I'm not sure I was left convinced by the formal interactions, and the ever-so clipped accents, we were in 1939, and serfdom disappeared some years ago! Whilst good there is no Oscar here as neither provided sufficient range within their roles.The movie was just stuffed with stars in minor roles it really was incredible, Danny Webb as a butler, Ben Chaplin as a lesser archaeologist, etc etc, great fun!We just didn't have enough treasure shown to underpin the magnitude of their finds, a silly omission.It was slow slow slow bordering on stop, and in hindsight very little script of note, it was panning camerawork, as if we were interested in Suffolk.Overall I enjoyed movie and am giving is a hard 6, worth a watch.","6","martimusross"," Well Worth A Watch, Quite Slow, Sunday Viewing!

"2143","Starts off very well, focussing on the dig itself. About halfway through, new characters and plot thrusts are introduced which turn the original narrative into a melodramatic yawn.
Since this sharp left turn involves the introduction of female issues and a new female character who enjoys considerable face-time, and who makes critical discoveries and insights, perhaps it was thought that insufficient attention had been paid to the recent mandate regarding empowering female characters in film.

"2147","I was ready to sit down to a slower-paced character driven movie and that is, more or less , what was delivered.The film goes on for about an hour with two main characters. Then, suddenly, a bunch more characters are added, including a young married couple in which the husband is a closeted gay man. Then we learn the wife, who starts chasing after the cousin of the lead protagonist lost her father to drowning. And her father had some other tragic ailment too. Then an RAF pilot in training tragically crashes in the river that goes right by the property and the cousin takes his gilly weed and dives in but the pilot is dead. And as the ancient artifact is dug up, the lead protagonist named Edith tragically comes down with a fatal case of acid reflux.Then they all get together for a party at the penultimate end.Then WWII breaks out at the final end.Great performances with a script that plays loose with the facts. As if facts matter in current year. And yet, that was the whole point of Ralph Feinnes digging stuff up, so people could know their past and where they came from.If you like slow-paced character driven stories and don't mind being lied to, this movie may be for you.","6","douglasp"," Entertaining enough but very silly

"2148","Being from Suffolk I thought this would be an interesting story about Sutton Hoo. I love long, slow films (There Will Be Blood for example) but The Dig just didn't have enough content to make it worth the stay. In 2 hours they dig a mound, find treasure (we get a glimpse of a couple of golden unidentified objects) and give it to the museum. That's it. I suppose the pathetically weak romantic subplot involving two minor characters was an attempt to add momentum. The other main draw was apparently the dialect coach who helped Fiennes. Great.
If you want scenery, go for a drive. If you want to know anything about Sutton Hoo, visit Wikipedia. If you want romance, watch Bridges of Maddison Country (if you must). Otherwise, you'll learn nothing and experience little, but hopefully have a nice nap with The Dig.

"2151","I'm a big fan of Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes, as both of them are remarkable actors who are able to uniquely infuse character development and range into any role they can play. Needless to say, this British drama about an excavation of the Sutton Hoo burial site right as World War II was beginning certainly delivers. The film focuses on two main characters, Edith (Carey Mulligan) and Basil (Ralph Fiennes.) Edith is a woman living on the property near the Sutton Hoo, reeling from grief yet also thoughtfully determined and autonomous in both her interpersonal and private lives. Basil is a mild-mannered archaeologist helping lead the excavation. Mulligan and Fiennes each portray remarkable emotional cores in their performances, and clearly are also able to convey the general sense of fear and uncertainty at the time in the United Kingdom as World War II was beginning through their performances as well as the broader historical context of the story.The cinematography of rural England is absolutely outstanding, with superb lighting and wide shots. With a delightfully simple aesthetic and a stirring score, these aesthetic qualities combined with gripping performances and well-detailed historical context create a uniquely powerful impact on the viewing experience. All of the characters are also very well-developed through the calmly understated yet deeply sophisticated writing, and a clear sense of purpose is present in all of them. The tensions between Edith and several individuals representing cultural institutions, such as the British Museum and Ipswich, about exactly what to do or where to send the discoveries from the excavation are also very gripping, creating an additional layer of depth to the story. Ultimately, what is so unique about this film is that it is simple and elegant on some levels, but powerful and layered on other levels. Its ultimate meanings on the significance of culture, history, and collective sacrifice will be read differently from viewer to viewer; nonetheless, this a very powerful and well-made drama that clearly succeeds as both a character acting piece and a potent historical study. Gladly recommended. 8/10","8","bastille-852-731547"," Mulligan and Fiennes excel in well-crafted drama

"2152","IN A NUTSHELL:
Based on a true story, this drama tells the historical account of the 1939 excavation of Sutton Hoo near Woodbridge in Suffolk, England. They actually found two medieval cemeteries on the site that date from the 6th to 7th centuries on a homeowner's private property. They found an undisturbed ship buried with a bunch of Anglo-Saxon artifacts. For an archaeologist, that had to have been extremely exciting. This, however, ain't no Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost ArkThe film is directed by Simon Stone and based on a novel by John Preston. It fills in some reimagined holes in the historic excavation. Just like the ship that remained hidden for centuries, the insightful film is a study of characters who are also overlooked by others around them. It's a slow, steady exploration of people and things that disappear in time.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

Respect for things and peopleTHINGS I LIKED:
The movie features some of my favorite actors: Ralph Fiennes, Carey Mulligan, and Lily James. Speaking of Ralph Fiennes, he actually helped to establish a real archaeological field school in England with his brother called The Poulton Project. It's a multi-period site that has special significance because of a medieval cemetery that students excavate every spring and summer! Very cool.
If you want to see two completely different performances by Carey Mulligan, check out her most recent movie PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN. You'll want to watch my review of that movie before you see it though because of its subject matter. Carey Mulligan is sure to receive an Oscar nomination for her outstanding performance in that role where she plays a young, beautiful woman. In THE DIG, she appears 20 years older!
A lot of the camerawork looks like it's hand-held because so many scenes are shot up close and personal, a good choice.
The film is well crafted and beautiful to look at as a period piece.
Be patient while the many layers of the story and its characters unfold.
The emotive score by Stefan Gregory is lovely and effective.
You just might look at artifacts in a museum differently the next time you go.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
It's a VERY slow-moving movie.
Did Ralph Fiennes put a cotton ball under his lower lip or something? Every time he spoke, I was completely distracted, trying to figure out what was going on with his mouth. Don't get me wrong...I still love him as an actor.
Lily James doesn't show up in the movie until almost a full hour into it. I absolutely adored Lily James in the live remake of CINDERELLA. She was PERFECT in it. In that movie, she played the daughter of Ben Chaplin, so it was SUPER weird seeing her kiss him as his wife in this film. I wanted to see more of her story in the movie.
Not a lot happens in this very straight-forward, almost dry telling of history.
Not much humor.
There's no specific villain other than time itself.
There's no urgency to the story. Perhaps that's intentional as time slowly marches on...You can watch my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!","7","trinaboice"," A slow-burning exploration of discovery, time, and character study

"2158","Started very well I was interested in the story of discovery. But this is a poorly written story beneath the quality of the actors in the film. The pace is too slow after the beginning character development. Well acted, except for the lame and vastly overdramatized social message inserted as the film goes on with Lily James character and her husband. Had the story concentrated on the history, and the archaeological importance as well as how the basic characters involved it dealt with those issues, it could have been good. As soon as the obviously politically pandering sexual element enters the film, it becomes aggravating and foolish. The relationships that are affected by this are not believable, cheesy, unbelievably melodramatic, and the chemistry is just not there. I wish people could just write a story without inserting social and political propaganda and messages. Such a shame, it could have been good.","3","Steelfram"," Mostly well acted but badly written and directed. High reviews reveal how low expectations of audience are.

"2162","Based on actual events with World War 2 looming on the horizon, there's much to admire in 'The Dig' - acting and cinematography in particular. The opening sequence tells how a widow commissions a local working class archeology enthusiast called Basil Brown to excavate several mysterious mounds on her property. Sadly, the film short-changes the achievements of this accomplished amateur, just as self-interested academics had done seventy years beforehand.After some significant artifacts are unearthed, the narrative subsequently shows how a pompous bigwig from London's British Museum arrives to muscle Brown out of the project's driving seat. A collection of colorful characters engaged in various intrigues while making momentous discoveries should have provided more than enough dramatic interest. Unfortunately the screenwriters appeared unable to find sufficient substance in the archeological affairs to sustain a feature film - and invented a tepid romance to flesh out the proceedings. This minor sub-plot provides little more than distraction and the story loses its way. If the script had probed a little deeper into the core material, complemented by a background of the beautiful East Anglian scenery, an impending worldwide catastrophe and ancient mysteries, the result would have surely been far more memorable.","6","tigerfish50"," Digging for Depth

"2168","The potential here for an educational and worthy tribute to the key players of the 1939 excavation of Sutton Hoo has been somewhat squandered by mid-production rejigging and the addition of parallel romantic storylines and refocus away from the central story of a landowner and her hired assistants digging for treasure, and finding it, against the clock, partially in battle with the archeological establishment and with her young son looking on with fascination, all set under the wide and beautifully shot Suffolk skies...why was that not enough?Buffini's script is sharp and the acting of high quality, especially Fiennes who plays his character with significant depth, intrigue and an apparent impeccable accent, and as the cinematography and gentle score gained momentum I was even almost able to forgive a moment of difficult-to-believe drama early on as I settled in to learn more about these characters and what they were about to unearth, only to have them sidelined by a number of other narrative threads that began to dominate the second half, leaving the original focus of the film neglected, it's conclusion rushed and much detail lost (or possibly even cut, as I suspect studio interference in an attempt to make the film more mainstream/easily-marketed)The result is, to some extent, an unsatisfactory narrative mess which, along with other production problems, goes some way towards ruining a project that still manages to achieve significant merit, interest and delight and I'm sure will be enjoyed by a wide audience, hopefully eventually in a proper cinematic release (and possibly with, as I argue for here, a writer-and-director-led recut!)ðŸŽŸ","5","wheeelertron"," 5/10 A Worthy But Misguided Dig Ends Up Shallow

"2169","What happened to this film halfway through? Did the writers run out of story? It doesn't seem so. It seems like they were just on the verge of really diving into the discovery itself and (critically) why it was so gosh darned important, and then suddenly the story was hijacked by terrorists or something. How else to explain the sudden shift?Instead of paying off all that buildup in digging (literally the name of the film) and character development from the first half, we're suddenly saddled with a whole new cast of characters who are almost completely irrelevant to the story but whose personal relationships suddenly take over the entire second half of the film, pushing the original characters onto the sidelines and derailing the entire effort. Not only are the original characters sidelined, but the discovery itself practically becomes an afterthought.Instead we're left following a bunch of random jerkweasels down idiotic subplots about adultery (actual) and homosexuality (implied), none of which have even the slightest relevance to the original story or characters. Was this another case of producers putting their grubby little fingers into things and wrecking it all up? I can only speculate.In the end the film earns a ""Eh, it passed the time..."" 5 Star rating, and that only barely and on account of stellar performances and a good first half that was clearly spoiled by nefarious persons.

"2172","I absolutely love Ralph Fiennes, and consider it a crime he was put in this film.Let me explain why i have such a low opinion of this film.The excavation of Sutton Hoo is one of the most important archeological finds that have ever happened .. in Britain. Mostly because of the amount of precious artefacts recovered. There was no surprise that the Anglo-Saxons populated the area, so it's not really comparable to any, say, south-american excavation revolutionizing our understanding of precolombian civilization.Anyway, the story is of Basil Brown, a ""guy"" who is called in to excavate a whole bunch of burial mounds. These mounds, being literal mounds of dirt, do not do much in the real of opposing to being dug up, and as such the digging goes on as expected. There is one pathetic scene of a cave-in (in a situation where it couldn't actually happen, but that is how desperate this film is for attention), but otherwise there is little conflict in this film that's beyond some harsh words at the team table.And, you know, conflict happens to be one of the major pivotal points of filmmaking. You really *do* need an antagonist in your film, if you're gonna have something that the protagonist is struggling against. And a protagonist's struggle is what causes the viewer to identify with the protagonist. I am sure that any filmmaker put in charge of several million quid's worth of budget knows.So, Basil Brown digs the defenseless mounds of earth, finds a wooden ship, a guy from the British Museum shows up, and the end...
I would not recommend The Dig. While there are some vaguely interesting attempts at period recreation, there is very little else of interest, and, i dare question why the subject matter was even considered exciting enough for a full-length film in the first place. Did they think Fiennes was going to magically generate a protagonist-antagonist relationship out of thin air?My vote: 5/10 - please look elsewhere for entertainment, *even* if you are an archeologist.","5","digdog-785-717538"," incredibly dull and boring (so, realistic)

"2173","With the exception of the remarkable archaeological find, there is not much of a story to tell. There were mounds, they dug, they discovered.

"2174","I was really enjoying this in the first half. The acting was first rate, down to earth, focused and skilled, dialogue was also quite realistic. Then...here we go again... the show dissolves in the standard fashionable route preferring PC undertones and diverting the emotional eye away from what was humanly and historically fascinating in the opening act. A clumsy musical score only goes to punctuate this as the film is driven down an abandoned rabbit hole. Why won't you just stop with the emasculation, quasi historical snobbery rubbish and allow the romances to shine in what is a fair and solid drama arc. Stop scraping our bones please!Didn't like the talking out of shot either, a cheap trick and in my opinion lazy. Directing the actors to speak in the shot and then edit the scene using the best performances is what making a film is. This director appears unsure, including in what it is to make a film, preferring to copy Fellini or the like. Its almost like two different films in one. If they merged then why not that has been achieved... sadly not here, these often, under lit sub plot, bumped clumsily into each other like two walrus's, I mean in a painful way.I love Ralph Fiennes in this and many of his films, he seems to be one of those rare individuals working in British Film and why does even bother? I mean, he must be seriously wealthy by now...still he remains true to his craft and keeps growing as a skilled artist. The thing is If they keep slashing up his films like this over and over I wonder if he will leave us behind, I wouldn't blame him one bit.","6","alightinthedarkfilms"," A fine show until....
"
"2175","The Dig is a well shot filmed, with some great performances from a talented cast. The main issue with The Dig is its pacing. The film is incredibly boring when there's no advancements on the excavation. I think the premise is great and interesting, but the terrible execution ruined most of the interest.There are plenty of subplots that just don't matter, and happen to really slow the movie down. There's a love subplot that feels unnecessary, and I really couldn't be less interested in such subplot. Every film has to have several subplots to keep the film going, but at least make it more about the main characters, or more closely related to the story.The Dig is an overall decent film, but the screenplay slowed down this already slow paced movie. At times I was constantly looking at the clock to see when this movie would end, but it felt like time itself slowed to the same pace as this movie. Some may really love The Dig, but for me, it's a 6/10. Not a bad movie, but it certainly could've been better.","6","DeBBss"," Exceptionally boring
"
"2176","For a movie with so many reviews teetering between either disparaging its direction as a Malick-wannabe or lauding it as having something eloquently poetic about it reminiscent of Terrence Malick, I was astonished to find The Dig far from being nearly as divisive as it should be. There's broad consensus that it's a well-acted and well-shot film despite its shortcomings. With only Days of Heaven under my belt (along with quite a few video essays about Malick's style), the only two rights I have here are to agree that: the comparison made here is valid; and the movie is decent at best. With low-angle, wide lens shots, wind-carried camera coming towards and away from the characters, and detaching the dialogue from the on-screen events that let us hover over the characters, it may well be argued that the technical approach rendered the film said poetic quality and a dream-like feel that implicitly beseech the viewer to give in to the meditative atmosphere that prevails the scene. Alas, this approach seems to be at odds with the most salient plotline in the story, or at least the one it was going for at first: the excavation of Sutton Hoo. For the movie neither probes into the remarkable discovery that forms the supposedly overarching thematic plotline nor does it completely ignore it. The story set it up in a fairly compelling way, only to ditch it quite early for the dramatic plotlines surrounding the two lead characters, leaving the historic achievement merely skimmed over.To be fair, Basil Brown and Edith Pretty are multi-layered characters that reveal themselves more and more as the story proceeds, and I could tell that from the get-go, only looking at Fiennes and Mulligan's sorrow-laden countenances that seem to hide (and actually are hiding) secrets underneath the story would later unravel. Still, the movie wasn't keen on diving into the characters' profiles, leaving much to be desired. Then, out of nowhere, the story shift its focus to another subplot concerning Lily James's Peggy Piggott. It's quite possibly the most interesting segment in the story, and Lily James really gave one of her most riveting performances to date. Be that as it may, this jarring shift from one storyline to another is rather distracting, aggravating the movie's lack of consistency even further, and the fact Mrs. Pretty's storyline was sidetracked for no reason makes it all the worse. Thankfully, and as the story wraps up, the movie finally acquired a discernible identity. The character arcs were mostly tied up gracefully and neatly, the technical prowess at its most thriving, and the film regained its contemplative tone with a dash of weltschmerz tossed in for effective measure. Despite its blatant inextricably linked issues, The Dig is a stunning-looking, great film with even greater performances buried inside a rather muddled one.(7/10)","7","AhmedSpielberg99"," As a Historical Biography, it's shallow; as a Drama, it's fine

"2178","This film reminds me of the Henry Kissinger line where he said ""When people meet me and they are bored, they think it's their fault."" People who watch this movie and don't get it or are bored with it, are too embarrassed to say it, they don't want to come across as unsophisticated. So they all pretend this is some cinematic masterpiece.

"
"2179","Don't know what I would have done in the old days when you couldn't fast forward but I was very thankful for the feature while I was watching this pedestrian crossing of a movie.
The only thing that stirred any feelings in me was the portrayal of the class system that I ran away from all those years ago. How they treated their servants and staff just like they were only one step above beasts of burden still gets me angry. How they got away with it for so long is beyond me.The storyline is so-so interestwise, the discovery of an Anglo-Saxon burial ship that was thought at first to be a Viking ship... Because it's Anglo-Saxon it moves back the dates of human occupation at the site and apparently that's very important to arcteryx...... sorry, ""archeologist"" intelligentsia.Big deal! They found a Viking ship in a pub's car park close to where I used to live and they didn't make a movie about that. In fact the first time they discovered it they covered it over with blacktop and put some tables and chairs out there.
Of course, the discovery in this plot only catches the interest of the upper crust, the poor peasants are too busy working the fields to be interested.So they have to fatten the story with a tragic illness, a backdrop of the second world war breaking out and a tiny bit of gratuitous nudity... don't blink , you'll miss it.
There is some good acting in it though and some good exploration of the counterplay between the educated professor and the gifted amateur archeologist but it's not enough to turn it into a great movie.I like Ralph Fiennes and I like Carey Mulligan but they didn't have a lot to work with. Ralph giving some kid his views on the universe and human existence belongs on Nova not in a big screen movie.","2","cordenw"," Boring

"2182","I can only imagine this is and American vision of the English of the past. The insipid an desiccated presentation of English class differences. People were either 'stuck up' and boring or inarticulate, forelock tugging and boring.
Creepy, cold piano chords accompany the most banal of conversations. as part of a truly deadly score throughout.
Ralph Fiennes 'county' accent is full of public school flaws and in portraying a rather self conscious man, over egged it so much that I just felt embarrassed for him. .
All players wooden through and through
Terrible screenplay.
Not a glimmer of humour or self reflexivity in any of these characters which renders them 2 dimensional.
I'm glad that so many people seemed to enjoy it .

"2183","One is an interesting, yet slow drama of an amateur archeologist meeting a woman who's willing to take a chance on him all based on real life events. The other is an appropriate period piece about a young woman finding herself in a loveless marriage with a gay husband in the 1930's, a less forgiving age of such thing. On their own, they both have merit. Together, they make a confused story, weaving around the two distinct plots so often that it seems like it's forgetting what it's about.It's an unfortunate result as both these plots are filled with charismatic writing and carried by phenomenal acting, Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes in the former plot, and Lily James and Johnny Flynn in the latter.Depending on which story drew you in, watching The Dig is like treading water, shifting between above water and below. Those shifts can sometimes bring jarringly violent as well, giving its audience the wrong kind of realization of just how much of this film is at war with itself. Is it about the glaring classism in the field of science or about love and loss? Is this a character study of people of that era or a story of how learning and honoring the past can bind people in the present?The movie attempts to bridge these gaps by including moments where the two distinct plots and themes intersect, but those moments of fleeting and stop short of making the point come across to its full effect.Perhaps the creators of The Dig did not think the nonfictional aspect of the plot centered around the Sutton Hoo excavation were enough to fill an entire film, a point to which I agree. Then the question becomes one that a movie-goer should never ask: why make this film at all?","4","rpvtimcotter"," The Dig is two films that should be nowhere near each other.
"
"2184","Sorry to go against the grain of all the rave reviews here, but I thought that although The Dig was beautifully, produced and photographed, it was dull, boring and tedious. It could easily have been edited down to an hour. The movie was saved by the impeccable performance of Ralf Fiennes as Basil Brown, with a pretty credible Suffolk accent.
SPOILER ALER
The writer clearly needed to pad out what, after all, is a very simple story with the entirely irrelevant triangular love saga of the frigid relationship between Stuart and Peggy Piggot, and the fictional cardboard-cutout character of dashing young Rory Lomax. The Piggots had apparently just come off their honeymoon, but clearly had no interest in each other and Peggy eventually fell for Rory. Earlier in the movie, Rory, who was about to join the RAF, had bravely dived into a river to attempt to rescue the pilot of a Spitfire that had crashed into it. Rory appeared to hold his breath for several minutes while extracting the pilot's body. This whole side story was irrelevant, ill-fitting and distracting from the main plot.
Having praised Ralph Fiennes, I cannot say the same for Carey Mulligan as my instant reaction on first seeing her on screen was ""Oh there is a young actress trying to portray a character much older than herself"".
Being new to Netflix, this is the first of their home-grown movies I have watched. I was disappointed at how they could spend so much time and effort to make a movie that looked so good, but in its structure and narrative was so disappointing.","4","ianquayle-50789"," Nice production values but too long

"2188","I have never liked the words ""Based on a true story"". Either give us a story as true as can be, or just give us a story. Here it's a bit like the Railway Children - exciting incidents at intervals. Realising that archeology might seem dull, it was decided there should be a couple of dramatic accidents and a love affair, neatly spaced through the running time. If only they could really have devoted themselves to transmitting the fascination of the archeology involved. It would have been a big challenge, but great if it had come off. (By the way, it's weird that we are not properly shown the treasure - not even in the end credits.) Instead we have a hefty dose of the dreamy ""last summer before war"" trope, admittedly with the odd downpour. I'm getting round to saying it's a bit boring. The actors: Carey Mulligan is too young, but otherwise wonderful (as is the boy playing her son). Ralph Fiennes is excellent. Lily James is wearing oversized modern designer glasses, lest we forget that she's a beautiful young actress of the 21st century. Johnny Flynn is too old, but gets away with it and really inhabits the period, especially in his manner of speech.","7","pawebster"," Interesting but also dull

"2194","The acting was great. Characters were fully fleshed out and relatable. The story, though not riveting, explored some of life's deeper meanings and trials. Very good all around. It did seem like it could have used a few more minutes at the end to wrap things up a little better. Also, a little more information and focus on the history of what they found was expected but not delivered. This is less of a history focused movie, and more a movie focused on the complexities of human relationships. That said, it's not a typical love story. It does have various ""love"" stories within it, but also focuses on the fact that our time is fleeting and precious, so we should consider how and who we spend it with wisely. I came for the history, and though I got a full on drama instead, I was not disappointed. It was done in a fresh way. One last warning, I wouldn't call this a feel good story. It was a bit sad.

The Dig has superior acting, a great setting/period, and an amazing ""based on true events"" story line. Unfortunately, after the big reveal around 20 minutes in, there just wasn't any more tension or drama. What drama there was felt forced and trite.In the second half the main characters, the main plot, and the ship all take a backseat to the drummed up love triangle of the ancillary-at-best characters that we care nothing about. This just feels awkward and doesn't really accomplish anything. The plot engine was definitely idled at the half. In the end the museum wins and the girl in the love triangle gets banged among the ruins of an old farmhouse and Ralph is left wondering why he wasted his talents on this experiment. That is all.

"2199","'The Dig' is a delicate tale with multiple layers. As is the case with good drama, the characters are multiple and varied in in their subtleties and their complexities. Interestingly, one of the lead characters is not a sentient being, but a meadow in a Suffolk field in England. However, this field is no ordinary fallow area of grass, it is populated by large mounds - likely ancient burial sites. Thus, this movie is innately interwoven with an archeological story of excavation and the potential of wondrous historical discovery.Parallel to this quite prosaic undertaking are several very human and engaging stories of grief, tragedy, recognition, ambition, greed and human revelation. These tales are very human, delicately explored on the screen through a well written script, exposed with a sensitivity not unlike the granular and studied removal of spoil from an archeological dig.There are numerous captivating dramatic portrays, not just involving the central protagonists, but also in the revelations of the supporting cast as well. A beautifully crafted piece of British drama where almost all cast members are given space of annunciate their role and emphasise their voice and their dynamic characteristics on screen. Humble characters are given the dramatic landscape and opportunity to shine. Thus, quiet characters are highlighted in a vibrant silabancy, adding to the dramatic ambiance of the production. A most enjoyable experience for this viewer, at least for me, anyway. Highly recommended.","8","mha-89327"," Beautifully Delivered & Unstated Quality British Drama

"2219","Was quite excited. Loved the Sutton Hoo artefacts from the history books from school but this film killed it.
Wow! Fiennes in the lead role. Couldn't go wrong could it?
He comes across as lobotomised and the Suffolk accent is ridiculous. You can just imagine him looking in the mirror saying 'moooorrniiiin' over and over and crunching a carrot to get in character.
The performances all round are pretty bad and the Lady Penelope character acts about 150 years out of place.
Worst of all is the film where almost nothing happens. Enthralling it isn't. Unless you enjoy watching Fiennes put on and take off wellies.
It would have been vastly improved by making the artefacts/treasure themselves as the main story and a nuanced and subtle Mr Basil Brown (it didn't help that this alliterative name continually evoked images of Basil Brush! Boom! Boom!) would still have been the central character and hogged the limelight but the iconic helmet etc. were nowhere to be seen.
Instead we were left with a seemingly challenged central character and innocuous, irrelevant sidekicks (e.g. the wife of Fiennes) who again appeared to be one brick short.
Slow torture it were and it's a shame as the subject matter could have been handled so much more adroitly.
Spielberg or Ridley Scott would have insisted on imagined flashbacks to the burial with CGI. If Ray Winstone could do it in Beowulf!

"2223","This period piece based on true events depict the discovery and excavation find in Britain just prior to and during the beginning of World War II. The movie depicts an amateur excavator hired by a widow to investigate some mounds of dirt on her property. The set design is well conceived, the acting polished and maybe well understated. The relational interactions between the primary characters are fascinating as they do not fall into any of the contrived script contraptions to great effect. A subplot involving a young lady archeologist and her relationship with her husband bordered on being a uninvited distraction, but seems to blend acceptably well into the movie as a whole.

"2226","A story about an archaeological dig may seem to be a subject of narrow interest to many for a full-length drama. However, director Simon Stone weaves a story of depth with many layers uncovered along the way. Carey Mulligan is outstanding as Edith Pretty, a widow with a bad heart but with a sense of discovery on her British estate. She employs Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) to lead a team excavating the mounds of land to find what treasures lie beneath.
Beautiful cinematography adds to this gem as England is on the cusp of war in 1938. Lily James is charming as a woman in a loveless marriage whose future plans are stymied due to the impending conflict with Germany.
Bases on a true story, The Dig explores the meaning of history and life through past civilizations but also raises the question of what happens to us, if anything, once our time is up on earth.

It's a unexpectedly emotional journey that you realize happened in real life. Definitely should be part of award season, especially the lead characters, but it's not what the movie is about, just showing life at its best and yet most difficult. A simple, small moment in time, yet momentous in the story of humanity.","10","janicepajerski"," A quietly emotional story
"
"2230","Every word of this film is freighted with meaning, as is every image. There's nothing superficial or redundant. The assembly of events via sound and image is subtly double-edged, conveying what is and what might be, occasionally teasing audience expectations and presenting alternatives which challenge our preconceptions of what should be.
To make a period drama that genuinely conveys how the people probably felt rather than how we would like them to have felt requires emotional and historical insight, some innate poetry and a willingness to take risks with audiences' levels of empathy and understanding. So, a necessary note of appreciation for the direction by Simon Stone, the script by Moira Buffini, the lighting, the camerawork, the design (costume and set) and the performances by everyone. There are no small parts in this film. It has been an incremental process of delicate decisions.
This film is a meditation about England and the English at a perilous moment in history as much as it is about Sutton Hoo and its treasures. There's poetry intertwined with myth, magic and humour - all underlying the concrete facts. In its conjunction of emotion, time and landscape it seems unlike most modern British cinema; one has to hark back to the past, to the extraordinary films of Powell and Pressburger in the 1940s, especially A CANTERBURY TALE, to match this mood, style, humour, sadness and triumph. Clearly, I believe The Dig belongs in very special company.

'An archaeologist embarks on the historically important excavation of Sutton Hoo in 1938.'
And for the first half of the movie, this is true. And it's exciting. And well acted.
But when they introduce Lily James,Peggy Piggott, the story changes. And as of now I still don't know to what. I like Lily James. I was excited to see her pop up because I didn't realize she was in it. But I still can't find a reason for her character. Other then, she was lonely? I was watching a movie about excavating, and then I wasn't. Very weird. Her story arc had no bearing on, well, the story. Then to find out, the character she fools around with is fictional. What? So now we know. Someone wanted her in it, so they made up a story line. With a guy going to war. Except, he wasn't real. So now I'm doubly sure her character was disposable.
For those who didn't see two different movies like me. I envy you. If they kept on track with the two main characters, Basil Brown and Edith Pretty, I just know I would have given it ten stars. But sadly, seeing a pretty face that has no purpose, well, has no purpose.

The contribution that Basil Brown made to archaeology and that particular discovery was emphasised and he was given the credit that academia, for some years, denied him..In some respects it was a real life event used as an allegory with Britain on the cusp of another terrible war with Germany and with the threat of invasion. Meanwhile in the quiet Suffolk countryside an ancient burial ship is being excavated of another German invader whose people, fifteen centuries previously, had invaded and conquered the island and who had brought their culture and language, ruled the country and given England both its name (Engla land) and its broadly invented identity as an ""Anglo Saxon"" country.We even got a hint of the ""Anglo Saxon"" warrior caste when the body of the young RAF pilot (another warrior) who has crashed and drowned is seen laid out (like a burial) in a small boat and brought to the shore.The photography was glorious with lovely lingering shots taken at dusk and dawn of the countryside and the mounds, while the recreation of the ship burial was superb. All in all a slow somewhat Ingmar Bergman-like approach to both dialogue and cinematography which was hugely enjoyable.Now to the buts. Did nine year old Robert really cycle from Woodbridge to Diss (30 miles/49 km) without anyone noticing?Carey Mulligan was too young to be Edith Pretty who would have been 56 in 1939 and Ken Stott was too old to be Charles Phillips who would have been 38 in 1939.The photographs of the excavation were taken by two teachers who were on holiday in the area and Edith's cousin Rory is an invention purely to provide a fictional love interest with ""Peggy"" Piggott whose marriage to Stuart Piggott actually ended in 1956. She went on to pursue her own academic career and in later life was in regular contact with Stuart .Finally why did the screenwriter feel obliged to suggest that Stuart Piggott was gay? As far as I am aware there is no evidence to suggest that he was, so why was it introduced?Or is having a token LGBTQ+ and/or a person of colour now de rigueur for all films?","8","FlossieCat"," An enjoyable film but...

"2236","It is 1939 and Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) hires an excavator, Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) to begin excavating (forgive the redundancy) some burial mounds found on the property of the former, on the presumption that they hide a great archaeological treasure.Simon Stone's film, based on a novel that fictionalizes a real event, aims to address an important (and necessary) series of topics around the discovery that occurs: ownership of the archaeological heritage, the dangers of the activity itself, finitude and human fragility in the face of the eternity of History and objects, the paternity of credit and glory for discoveries, class difference, historical knowledge itself, memory and the ominous threat of a war in the making.An interesting and set of aspects that do not provide a conclusive synthesis and dramatic expression. Stone's decaffeinated film somehow mimics Ivory's British quality, but doesn't match his mystery. We are not facing Downton Abbey and much less The Crown. His characters at 10 minutes are already defined. On the other hand, the epic of search and discovery, essential in a story of this kind, is not exciting. When some characters and situations run out of gas, the director focuses the focus on others and even modifies the narrative structure to regain the viewer's interest, with partial results. Perhaps the melancholy of Mrs. Pretty and Mr. Brown defines the climate of the film, but this affects its results.Since the photography is beautiful, the music is omnipresent and invasive and the performances are very good, in particular those of the infallible Fiennes and Mulligan who are joined by Lily James, in charge of the young archaeologist Peggy Preston, perhaps the most interesting and that brings oxygen to a history that will be protected and defended by the now omnipotent shield of the ""based on real events"" and the inextinguishable cholulism that the English nobility continues to generate","5","danybur"," Like a decaf James Ivory

"2241","The Dig (2021) **When stuck in a plot hole, crime writer Raymond Chandler used to send in a new character with a gun. Simon Shine has employed the same concept, minus weaponry. People just keep turning up in the Dig, adding very little to the story, which in itself, setting aside National Trust hype, is on the slim side. A sixth-century burial site (thought it does cast new light on the Dark Ages so we are told) is not in the same archeological class as a velociraptor or an Egyptian tomb. Mostly, we are misled. For the first third it looks like we are heading for Lady Chatterley's Lover territory with posh lady (Carey Mulligan) eyeing up the digger (Ralph Fiennes) until his wife turns up. Then it looks like it's going to be a battle royal between Fiennes and the Establishment, but that is headed off.It's 1939 so the Second world War is on its way. Cue the arrival of wannabe pilot (Johnny Flynn). A top archaeologist (Ken Stott) also appears but that doesn't go anywhere either, bringing with him Ben Chaplin and Lily James fresh from their honeymoon. James gets the hots for Johnny Flynn and there's just enough time before the credits roll for them to get at it.This is the kind of film that has money to spend on an old WW2 aeroplane or maybe a CGI version of one but not enough for decent sound recording equipment. Most of the time conversations are over the shoulder or in long shot. It's not just words, it's expressions, faces that tell a story, and being denied these seems bizarre. It may be an artistic decision, some critic thought we were being made to ""dig"" for the story. But it's hard enough to work up any enthusiasm without being made to work harder.Ralph Fiennes is excellent, a son of the soil, self-taught, but no shrinking violet either. His scenes with posh lady's son (Archie Barnes) are very touching, the young lad having invented a whole world for himself. Carey Mulligan just looks as though she's about to burst into tears, probably wondering how she managed to be talked into playing (at age 34) a woman who was actually 56 at the time of the dig and wishing Nicole Kidman and Cate Blanchett (closer to that age) who were at one point attached had not left her to it.The dig itself is interesting - but only for about five minutes. We know all we need to know about the boring sifting and brushing and digging from other films and we don't learn more from this except how easy it is for a wall to suddenly collapse and nearly kill someone.
The most intriguing part of the film came at the end when we discovered that the burial ship dug up was buried for the duration of the war in an Underground station in London. How did they manage that, I wondered. Whereas I didn't wonder much about anything else in this film.","3","bhkhannan"," More toil than story

"2242","The best a film about an archeological dig can be without someone cracking a whip and being chased down a tunnel by a boulder.

It is one of those movies which is very watchable without you ever really getting enthralled by any of the characters.

"2247","After watching ""The English Patient"" and ""The Constant Gardener"", I swore I would never watch another movie with Ralph Fiennes again as long as I lived.

I found this to be surprisingly good cinema. Very well done, with good talent, great cinematography, albeit a somewhat slowly evolving storyline. That, however, is perfectly in tune with 1939 Britain - bad cooking and all.
I'm only submitting this review so that those who happen to click on my other reviews don't get the impression that I hate everything - it's just that I find most modern cinema poorly written, horribly acted, and ridiculously childish.

I didn't understand what the author wanted to say with his work. What should I understand after watching this movie, how will I become better after seeing this, what will the movie can teach me?
Is this movie about passionate people ? ""No, I didn't see a passion for digging in Carey Mulligan. When she was called to look at the found ship, her reaction was about the same as if I would see a promotion for a second free hamburger at McDonald's.
There was an attempt to create several hooks that logically
should have led to the development of the plot. But for some reason, the director or screenwriter did not develop this. It can be seen that the authors of the film have a bad idea of what really burning people look like, who are burning with ideas to find something new.
The result was a shallow and sometimes not logical movie, I do not feel sorry for any of the characters.
This is a slow, non-eventful, boring film about human relations, against the background of archaeological excavations, in which there are attractive landscapes, pleasant-looking clothes, rather boring dialogues.","5","leoburnman"," Boring film about human relations
"
"2249","It is one of those films that are soothing for me to watch. Knowing characters like Edith existed (and continue to exist) turns on a light. She tells excavator Basil Brown that she ""feels"" something lays beneath the mounds on her property. Of course she is an experienced archeologist and of course, as Daniel Kahneman says, she has the ""expert intuition"" but she says she feels, nonetheless. She pursued this undertaking not only because as an archeologist she could recognize the patterns but also because she was compelled by her inner forces to try and create something very much worth experiencing and not just for herself. As the story progresses she finds out she is terminally ill. She draws strength from each to face the other and manages to make such harmonious realizations of both endeavors. It reminded me of a scene in which Harry (in Harry Potter stories), abandoning all apparent logic, goes to see Hagrid in his shed. I don't recall in what context this happens but I do remember as a result of this act, everyone (that mattered) came to a better understanding of the situation. It doesn't seem like a significant scene but it had stayed with me, I think, because it shows how beautiful it can be if we sometimes embody something more than mere common wisdom.In a scene Mr. Brown's wife, trying to reassure him of his work, reminds him of some of his own words. She remarks archeology is not about the past nor it is about the present but that it is about the future, so that future generations know what came before them, know their forefathers. Because of their findings it became clear that Anglo Saxons were cultured people that had rich rituals, art and trade.After extracting the treasure and after all the excitements are over, Mr. Brown returns to the cite to carefully bury back the ship or more precisely the impressions of the ship, giving it the respect it deserved. Not only by his conviction, he shed some light to the lives of the people who had lived more than thirteen centers before in the land but also he had the capacity to pay respect to the people who were gone eons before.And all of this happened while some people were thinking the best thing could be done was waging a war against humanity and, well, the rest were making preparations for defense.One thing I'd like to point out is I think a typical child does not respond to the pain of that magnitude like how Edith's son is portrayed. A child's response would be more like Conor in A Monster Calls. Now that I've mentioned this I have to confess I adore both Carey Mulligan and Felicity Jones. So, you better take my review with this knowledge ;)","10","Fatemeh_Hadi"," An Inspiring Soothing Real Story

"2250","Shining a light on the little known story behind the important discovery of ancient Anglo-Saxon artefacts at the Sutton Hoo dig site in England during the late 1930's as war threatened to rage on around the peaceful country, Netflix's latest prestige drama is the very definition of an easy watch movie that is one the whole family will be able to enjoy.At times Australian director Simon Stone's film threatens to be something more than this, for the first 30 to 40 minutes the tale of Ralph Fiennes archaeologist Basil Brown's work on Carey Mulligan's widow Edith Pretty's farm land that is based off a hunch she has about the mysterious mounds that are located on her property is one that will grip you in its English countryside beauty and thrill of Brown's early digging on the site but the film sadly starts to lose momentum and focus from here on out as other characters join the fray and the tales focus has awkward shifts that never feel totally earned.Looking to cast a wide net on on those involved with the Sutton Hoo site excavation, the initial intrigue around the job at hand and Brown and Pretty's friendship and working relationship is a strong component of the early stages of Stones film but when the likes of Johnny Flynn's wannabe pilot/photographer Rory and Ben Chaplin and Lily James Mr and Mrs Piggott enter the picture it feels as though Stone and the film lose themselves to subplots and dalliances that vary in their intrigue levels for viewers and The Dig starts to become less about its titular task and more about dramatics that don't add a whole lot of engagement to what was at one stage a focused and gripping true life tale.An element that remains strong throughout The Dig is a collection of strong performances from its talented cast with Ralph Fiennes getting his best role in sometime here as the socially inept Brown while Mulligan is her typically assured self as the ailing Edith.Both performers are reasons why The Dig is so gripping in its initial phases and its a shame they begin to get less screen time together and overall when the likes of Flynn, Chaplin and James roll into the frame. It's not that these performers are in any way bad, its just by the time they arrive we as an audience have already grown attached to the journey's of Brown and Pretty and their respective drive to uncover what could be one of England's most noteworthy cultural discoveries and find meaning in their lives after respective failures, disappointments and heartbreak.Final Say -A film that is beautiful to look at and one that will grip you early with its characters and dirt covered subject matter, The Dig is a solid Netflix prestige offering that suffers from a lack of focus and too many plot strands as it progresses along its merry way.3 tarps out of 5","6","eddie_baggins"," An enjoyable Netflix drama that loses momentum as it goes

"2251","A movie that focuses on pre-war archaeological discovery is currently newsworthy with ""The Dig"" being released on Netflix on the 40th anniversary of the first installment of Indiana Jones' rollicking adventures; ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Whilst, Indiana Jones is pure fiction and action oriented, ""The Dig"" is a romantic drama that meanders from the outset. Having said that, the key events surrounding the excavation of an Anglo Saxon treasure ship are loosely based on true events. A wealthy widow played by Carey Mulligan permits an experienced amateur archaeologist (Ralph Fiennes) to investigate what lurks beneath the mysterious hillocks that frequent her windswept coastal Suffolk estate.The film begins beautifully with the countryside offering a dreamy backdrop to the main character's burgeoning friendship and their respective plights. The viewer is transported back in time, and becomes a participant in the hunt to find hidden treasures. The camera work poetically caresses the senses, and it's undoubtedly a movie that demands a spare plot so the viewer can soak up the atmosphere, and fully appreciate the masterclass performances from the two leads.This initially, well rounded art house film gradually morphs into a more wishy washy affair with a group of newly introduced characters stealing the lead actors' thunder halfway through. Another recent slow burning, visual piece - ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" (2019) flourished by having unhindered character development, and by remaining true to its inherent nature from start to finish. It (seemingly) wasn't made first and foremost as a box office venture like material made for Netflix often is. A decision was probably made (in The Dig) to shift gears from its established tempo, so as to grab the attention of the kind of viewer who might be nodding off, or who prefers a bit more sex appeal. As a result - it's a movie of two halves. 6/10 overall","6","rup_74"," A Film of Two Halves

"2254","Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan are two actors who I think are amazing so it's nice to see both of them in a great film together.The Dig is based on the true story of an archaeologist hired by a British widow to dig up areas of her land which eventually leads to an extraordinary find.Apart from the Mulligan and Fiennes, I wasn't too interested in seeing The Dig but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed watching it. First of all, I really liked the production design and overall visual look of the film. The Dig is certainly a period piece and the costumes, location and accents really sold the time period the film is set in. Some of the shots and colours shown in the film are very beautiful to look at. I don't have much of an interest in archaeology but I was fascinated by the whole excavation. The score was nice to listen to however I think the film used it too many times throughout.There isn't a whole lot of plot because The Dig is primarily character driven. Due to this, the film moves at slow pace which didn't bother me much but there were a few moments where I wanted it to speed up. There is a lot we learn about each of the characters as the film goes on and because of this, emotion is created as we start to care for each of them. The film does a good job establishing the relationships between characters. I felt the most sympathy for Carey Mulligan's character and her performance made me care for her ever more. Her accent is good and the subtle expressions on her face convey so much about Mrs. Pretty and the way she's feeling. Ralph Fiennes delivers yet another fantastic performance. He's fully believable in the role and plays Basil Brown gracefully. It came as a surprise to me seeing Lily James as I had no idea she was in it. She does a good job but her subplot didn't feel necessary to the main storyline.All in all, I do like The Dig.

The married couple actually makes no dramatic sense as we are not given any backstory as to how this marriage happened or how the wife only now figures out what's wrong.Now if somehow the original characters were integral to this second story it would have been different but it like we are watching another movie that was filmed next door and the actors from the first were asked to come in and be extras.

The Sutton Hoo helmet is one of the most iconic finds in the history of archeology- and it doesn't feature.It's like making a movie about Howard Carter and not showing the golden burial mask of Tutankhamen - crazy.Some may argue this movie is entirely about the characters - fine, but I desperately wanted to feel the moment when these beautiful artifacts were held and seen for the first time and it didn't truly deliver on that point.","8","mckaymalcolm"," Great poignant movie but....

"2259","God damn, what a beautiful movie.""The Dig"" is a masterclass in powerful filmmaking - borne from Moira Buffini's brilliantly written screenplay, gifting actors with sumptuously layered characters to play, who mindfully convey so much of the suggested subtext on the page in the delicate nuances of their performances. Director Simon Stone also impressively crafts phenomenally edited sequences (thank you Jon Harris) to capitalise off of these impactful moments of dramatic tension, exacerbating the meticulously placed silences throughout - where the unspoken words deafen audiences with their intentional presence - until the quality of the material present in the script is elevated even further as a result. Commendation is therefore owed to the outstanding sound designers - who really bring their A game here - & additionally, to cinematographer Mike Eley, who genuinely astonishes with his gorgeous camera work / uses of natural light, gently immersing audiences in to the story with handheld shots that feel warm, grounded & hopeful - akin to Terrence Malick's 1978 classic, ""Days of Heaven"".Can't recommend it highly enough.

The film doesn't forget to add a healthy dose of themes derived from thinking about why the subject matter means so much to its characters. The ideas about our impermanence and immortality, through an archeological lens, could be captivating but they are presented without the careful, seamless weaving of the narrative dress that defines good storytelling.

The performances from Lily James, Ralph Fiennes, and Carey Mulligan are pretty good. Each have their own moment to shine without taking too much of the spotlight. Each has their own self contained story that's mostly interesting even if Lily James's character feels a little cliched at points. The story is engaging as it follows an archaeological exploration of a old Anglo-Saxon vessel. However, a solid 1/3 of this film is somewhat boring and slow. These moments are whenever we follow characters that aren't portrayed by Mulligan, James, or Fiennes. The screenplay is fine. There is nothing extraordinary about it and it isn't bad but there's nothing really special about it. The cinematography was very good though. Each shoot looks very beautiful and is framed in an interesting way. Costumes and set design are on point too. This is a quiet little film that's gonna go under the radar this year.

"2269","The Dig commits the most unpardonable sin a movie could, and that is the fact that it's boring. All the nice performances, good cinematography and spot-on period detail in the world can't change the dull script, and I ended up making jokes about the ongoing staidness to my friend just to survive the runtime.The event that it didn't impress me shouldn't come as much surprise, after all this movie arrives hot-on-the-heels of overrated tripe like Normal People and Bridgerton. At least this is just a movie, only two hours you'll never get back. The others are full-blown TV series which go on for much longer. Give the next episode a try if I hated the first? Not on your nelly. Life is too short.What else can I say about it? A bunch of uninteresting adults, and an unbelievably annoying kid, potter around a large field talking nonsense while excavating for a large ship. If you can stand the company of these bores for a period of more than a few minutes, then good luck to you. I found their inconsequential lives utterly tedious, and the few moments where things threatened to get intriguing were soon snuffed out by more verbal guff and long strolls in the country. Yawn.About halfway through, as if realising the complete monotony of what they were serving us up, they introduce a new couple of characters... a sexually-starved bride and her nebbish husband who kind of take over the movie. Neither of these unexpected additions contributes anything of note to the story, besides more dreary padding.Basically, I didn't give a hoot about any of these prosaic individuals, no matter how much cheap melodrama they threw at us (especially late on). It all adds up to a real snooze fest that, unless you're a sufferer of acute insomnia, I'd bail out while I have the chance. 4/10","4","sarcasm_for_free"," I didn't 'dig' it.

Sure the acting was adequate, and the cinematography was good, and certainly put across the English country side very well.
But overall, I found it long, dull and certainly not entertaining.
There was very little if any information on the historic relevance of the find. The legal challenge over the ownership was glossed over.
Instead, the film attempts to focus on some very weak relationships.

"2274","This film is compelling. The the plot would sound dull and ordinary if said aloud, but I could not take my eyes off the screen. Its as British as you can get. A moving, life affirming film thst plays to all its strengths and doesn't try to be anything it isn't but succeeds in everything that it is. The cinematography is gorgeous with wide beautiful landscapes of rural Suffolk countryside through various weather conditions. The acting is riveting and utterly authentic and the chemistry between all performers believable and holds your eyes and ears on the screen.
With strong links and having lived in Norfolk for 10 years, seeing the Suffolk accent absolutely nailed perfectly by Ralph F was a joy. The soundtrack was perfect and added everything it needed to and never caused a distraction to what was on screen. Having watched a number of straight to Netflix films for a long time now this is quite simply a cut above anything iv seen for a long time and would I'm sure in another time been a wonderful cinematic release.","10","garethallen-65236"," Keep calm and keep digging

"2280","Others will review the acting, direction, costumes and cinematography, all of which are excellent. To me, however, this film is distinguished by its slow revelation of the human spirit in the context of the slow motion of history. The mounds hid treasures unknown for over a thousand years. The ""excavator"" - the real hero of the story - is an under appreciated genius, whose work is quickly commandeered by the representatives of formal society. The owner seems to be just another wealthy heiress, until you learn the tragedy of her widowhood and her frail health. And the minor character of the excavator's wife is first seen as a bumbling ignorant woman, until you see her strength in supporting her husband in his moment of weakness and defeat. There's more, but all in the same vein of discovery of that which is at first hidden. ""The Dig"" connects past, present and future, one generation to those that came before and those that will come after. Truly, a story for the ages.","10","amfriedland47"," A story for the ages

And of course, in good old Hollywood fashion, the token 'gay' representation gets thrown in there. Why? My G*d is that going to happen with EVERY SINGLE MOVIE now? It's so painfully obvious and it absolutely destroys the 'flow' of the movie. A 'side plot' just to make room for political correctness. How utterly pathetic. How I long for just an honest to goodness 'really good movie' based on plot and performance......The whole storyline and basis for the movie got thrown out the window with 'side stories' from that point on. Very sad.","7","mskatherine-98164"," A 7 ...only because of Fiennes

"2282","""The Dig"" is a fascinating story, it being about a WW2-era excavation of buried Anglo-Saxon treasure, and it's apt that much of the surrounding drama revolves around exploration, impending death and preservation for posterity. A costume drama set in the past about exploring the past, where ancestors once explored the seas and pilots now fly in the skies.I'm less fond of the editing style that has audio of conversations overlapping silent moments, although the cinematography and production design stand out. Unfortunate for a Netflix release, it sometimes has the appearance of video lag, as though the the audio and picture had only become out of sync due to a poor internet connection. Otherwise, it doesn't seem much better than a confused imitation of Terrence Malick-esque ruminations, such as in, say, the recent WW2-era ""A Hidden Life"" (2019). I'm not sure what the filmmakers were trying to go for here, either--maybe that cinematic editing travels through time much like the burial grounds, but I don't think it's effective.Besides that, Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes lead a fine cast. Both face their own mortality at one point or another while uncovering the ancient graveyard. Other characters, including a romance with a drafted pilot and a homosexual husband, some of which appears to be added fiction in this based-on-a-true-story, also call attention to the fleeting nature of life by seeking happiness or meaning while it lasts. And, of course, the archeological find itself is the greatest series of artifacts from the deceased preserved for posterity. This goes to one of my favorite analogies of film-as-death, including as recorded ghosts for future generations to see. ""The Dig"" reflexively alludes to this through the still photography taken within the movie of the excavation. That the movie replaces the historical photographers of the event with a would-be soldier in the deadliest war in history may further underscore this. So apt is this that it largely compensates for any pacing or technical imperfections in the picture.","7","Cineanalyst"," Buried Treasure

A fragile magic lies in the unspectacular treatment of all human relationships being involved, in and around the place of the digging. The most touching moments suddenly reveal itself with subtle understatement, deeper meaning in seemingly unimportant details, unspoken words, the way people look at each other, or refuse to look, tells more than any outburst of drama, as if the emotions have to be excavated in a similar way to the ancient Anglo-Saxon ship in the ground, hidden under layers of dark earth.

"2298","A story about archeology isn't something that can easily grab people's attention but this film will make you care about little brushes and coins by the time it's over. Ralph Fiennes plays an excavator who is hired by a small estate owner to dig up some ancient barrows. The owner is an ailing woman and knowing that her days are numbered, she is personally invested in the hope that he will be able to discover something of value that will leave a legacy. One thing she didn't account for is the start of World War 2 and how much of an impact it will have on both the excavation and the lives of everyone involved in it.Normally, when people think about archeology it's the dinosaur bones and ancient temples that come to mind; not nails or rotten planks. Certainly, nobody thinks of Archeological Politics but that is what becomes the central focus of the story considering the significance of the discovery. However, this movie is a lot more than excavation because underneath all the digging, lies a multitude of little tales about everyone involved in the process and thanks to the first rate acting, we end up genuinely caring about their fates.To compliment the skilled actors, the film utilizes high production values with scrupulous attention to details ensuring a smooth and touching viewing experience. The Dig feels like the sort of a story that would occur before a war. Each character deals with their own troubles whether it's life ambition, love intrigue or treasure. Sadly, when the winds of war begin to blow, everything freezes in time as priorities change and the world stops caring about archeology.If you are looking for a balanced and patient drama with great acting and smooth atmosphere then The Dig is for you.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for Movies and TV shows","8","arabnikita"," Patient and beautiful story with great acting and solid production

"2300","I had never heard of the archeological dig in Sutton Hoo, so that made ""The Dig"" even more of a treat. Focusing on both the excavation of Anglo-Saxon artifacts and the relationship between the digger (Ralph Fiennes) and the landowner (Carey Mulligan), the movie has a lot in store. The setting on the eve of World War II further raises the stakes.The story also draws attention to the Anglo-Saxon culture. It's worth noting that the Anglo-Saxons weren't England's original inhabitants, but became the dominant culture after invading. Their language - often called Old English - looked like Icelandic (the Norman invasion of 1066 made English more like the Romance languages); there's even an Anglo-Saxon Wikipedia. It would be neat to see what English would like today if the language hadn't changed (for example, we would still have the letter Ã†).But anyway, it's a fine movie.

"2304","Gary N. Kramer, movie critic for 'Salon' ezine, wrote, "" There is a nagging sense that the film should have played up the importance of the Sutton Hoo find more,"" as he faults the movie for concentrating more on the characters than on the archaeology.I disagree with him as I watched this film with questions about life, death, how we live and the choices we make for whatever reasons at the time. As the archaeological find of the Anglo-Saxon burial ship proceeds, we are confronted with the thought that this ancient ship was constructed, then buried, by real people. This plays out against the backdrop of England preparing for what we know will be a horrific war in which millions will be killed. Life in the midst of death, death a presence in every life, and yet we as a people live on. What will archaeologists of the future find of us?Ralph Fiennes conveys the the fully realized character of the proud, stubborn excavator with profoundly effective subtle changes revealed by his eyes, his pipe, and his occasional hint of a smile. Carey Mulligan as Edith Pretty, the owner of mound being excavated, is more of the cliched stalwart, stiff upper-lip British lady; the well-written script heavily favors excavator Basil Brown.The director utilized a sure hand in the shaping of the film, the cinematography was gorgeous and the only somewhat jarring note was the rather buffoonish behavior of the so-called professionals from time to time.","9","mzmck"," The poignant haunting of death as the backdrop of our brief lives.

"2309","Dig reimagines the events of the 1939 excavation of Sutton Hoo. It stars Carey Mulligan as landowner Edith Pretty and Ralph Fiennes as the self-taught archaeologist-excavator Basil Brown, both of them gave strong performances.
The English countryside is its own character, as the film wouldn't be as amazing if they wouldn't have shown off the gorgeous scenery. The cinematography is incredible, it's beautiful shot with natural lightning, indoors and outdoors are stunning.
The screenplay and overall writing is mostly good, even great at times. But I felt the movie didn't need a romantic storyline that isn't historical accurate, the big changes to Peggy Piggott is another thing I didn't really like as she is supposed to have been an experienced archaeologist and had studied archaeology, for an example. The age difference for some of the actors is something I can look past except for Peggy's husband which should be two years older.The musical score is simple but touching, with its piano and other instruments, Stefan Gregory created a phenomenal score that's so fitting to the film.Archeology is something I have always been interested in and seeing a film doing it in a realistic way was life. I knew nothing of the Sutton Hoo excavation before watching this film, and after doing some research I'm glad Netflix distributed it and gave Simon Stone the chance to direct it, amazing direction and a great film.

In this case the story of Basil Brown is fundamentally true. Well done! The film is beautifully shot, the atmosphere of pre-war Suffolk is captured in subtle muted colours and the local accent is accurately portrayed. Treat it as a film, and you will love it. However if you look for the facts, you will find many variances. In particular you will discover that Peggy's liaison is fictional, and the two actual photographers were omitted. The one startling omission, for which the film loses a star, is that the magnificent artefacts now in the British Museum are not shown, just a few grubby bits of metal.

"2316","A good character drama and biography. Sometimes a bit slow moving but thats because the film rather cares for its characters than for an exciting plot. The plot is not to underestimate but the focus is on the characters. Sometimes it was a bit over the place in that regard because new characters appear and become important, without a proper introduction and in some ways even overtake the importance of the leading protangonists. But other than that its a beautful feature with very nice attributes. Carey Mulligan is fantastic in the female lead and follows up her acclaimed performance in ""Promising Young Woman"" wonderfully. Ralph Fiennes also is great in a very calm but absolutely mannereed and controled peformance. Nice support by Lily James as well. Good cinematography, great score and a beautiful production design round it up to a well produced drama.

As ""Titanic"" used the oceanliner and its inevitable fate as the backdrop in a deeper story - albeit a fictional one, so does this movie use its own backdrop as a fulcrum of sorts for several forays into the pathways of human experience.As always, stories of humanity, no matter how well the visuals are conceived and presented, will fall flat and lifeless if the *characters* are not on a par with the screenplay and look. No worries: these main stars have never disappointed before and most certainly do not here! And the young actor, somehow, and unexpectedly - well, he's about as good as it gets, and his scenes with Fiennes are golden.We've all seen movies that we users basically like a lot, yet contradict the terrible scores from critics - ""Hillbilly Elegy "" anybody? - but when both user reviewers and critics are agreeing and are saying the same things, it's a pretty safe bet you will not be wasting your time.

"2326","""The dig"" is about archaeology, first and foremost. Not only that it's based on a true story; this is also a historic event. I only learned about these events when I watch the movie, but that reflects just my ignorance. The ""Sutton Hoo Find"" has been hailed by many as one of the most important archaeological discoveries of all time. This movie, however, has a lot more to offer, not the least of which a strong cast, particularly the lead role: Edith Pretty portrayed by Carey Mulligan.After her first Oscar nomination 11 years ago for Best Actress (""An education"") Mulligan did very well this year with ""Promising Young Woman"", winning the Film Critics' Association award as well as getting nominations for Oscar and Golden Globe. During these eleven years, she times and again demonstrated the depth of her talent and the width of her range. Her best work, however, is little known, a movie entitled ""Wildlife"" (2018), in which she portrays an ordinary person under circumstances not particularly exceptional, a role for which it is difficult to shine. She shines.In ""The dig"" she plays a widow whose health is failing, looking tired and pale, a polar opposite to the glamorous ""Promising young woman"" that recently put her in the entertainment world limelight. The performance, however, is equally superb. Edith Pretty, fascinated by archaeology since her childhood, thanks to her father, believes that her expansive property is a treasure ground (which turns out to be literally so eventually) and hires experienced but professionally uncredited Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) to conduct the dig. Fiennes is completely unrecognizable from his iconic role Voldemort, playing this humble man from the working class. The first half of the movie is basically shared by these two people.Between them, they take the audience through a journey of discovery, revealing under the dug-up earth first a skeleton of an 88-foot ship, then a burial chamber it carried, then all kinds of treasure and artifacts. Through this process depicted in meticulous details, the audience is also enlightened to the fact that archaeology is not about the dead. ""It's life we found. That's why we dig"". A case in point is the very discovery in this story dispels the myth that Anglo-Saxons were violent and savage but instead ""they had art. They had culture."" ""The dark ages are no longer dark"", comes the triumphant proclamation.Carrying the first half of the movie between themselves, Edith and Basil tantalize the audience with their extraordinary chemistry. Often, they appear at dawn and dusk, framed in mesmerizing photography, two lonely figures sharing a common passion, a thirst for knowledge, standing on a mound looking down into their new dig. The tantalizing thing is that this does not appear to be entirely platonic. When inviting Basil to dinner at her place, Edith goes to great length in making her pale, world-weary self look attractive. The bubble bursts when Basil's wife suddenly shows up for a short visit, a normal thing for a normal wife to do when a husband is totally addicted to work.The change in tone in the second half of the movie is somewhat uneven. In a nutshell, it gets busy. Top of this support cast is Lily James who, similar to Mulligan, trades her glamour for an ordinary-looking woman Peggy Piggott, who gets recognition from her competence in the field of archaeology than her looks. Others in the assortment of people gravitated towards the new Suffolk finds are her husband Stuart (Ban Chaplin) who apparently is more interested in men than women, and Edith's photographer cousin Rory (Johnny Flynn, who you may remember if you have watched ""Emma"", the most recent version featuring Anya Taylor-Joy), who fills the empty space in Peggy's heart left by her husband. Among the rest of the large support cast, fully deserving mentioning is wonderful young actor Archie Barnes, playing Edith's son Robert who develops a bond with Basil as sort of a new father-figure.Lurking in the background is the imminent WWII, with occasional war planes flying pastoral landscape, adding a sense of ominous urgency.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","harry_tk_yung"," true story depicted by an excellent cast

"2329","The Dig incorporates a true story with the themes in a novel, and bits and pieces of present day industry trends. Mulligan and Fiennes in the lead roles bring their skill without reserve, as do the remainder of the cast. It's worth watching for that. The parts that make it not very good is the over-attention to unrelated clichÃ© themes without any lead-in, investigation, or resolution; the historical goofs that really wouldn't have been that diffiult to correct; and the whole approach to how and when it was made. The most interesting theme related to the lead role was opened and closed within 30 seconds - very frustrating to watch rare opportunity so clumsily discarded.

The little bits of tension and drama in there like the love affair or the spat between real and amateur archaeologist just play out pretty quickly.It just does not seem like a story that translates well to television and perhaps a documentary would have been a better format because it could have handled the same themes AND it could have addressed the Sutton Hoo and the artefacts in more detail.","6","diggnuts"," And suddenly nothing much happened at all.

"2348","The world needs more subtlety like this.The story doesn't need to be groundbreaking, riveting or shocking, but can be about normal things that are expressed in a genuine way, with top-notch acting across the board that helps The Dig tremendously.The thing that appealed to me the most were the sub plots of love, endearment and commitment within the main plot of the film: the uncovering of some remarkable remains and treasures, which hold the movie together and are the lynch pins, but not the most important aspect of the story because it's the underpinning relationships between lovers, mothers, sons and grandparents that bring The Dig full circle in an especially pleasing way.The movie isn't an epic one and there are very few triple-A scenes or effects that may have you drooling, such as the incredible war scenes in Atonement, but it does have enchantment in buckets and spades and hopefully, like me, you'll be taken in and pacified by its extra slice of caring and love that's much needed in all of our lives, whoever we may be.Watch it; it's very very nice and the acting is an absolute delight.","8","Richard_Alex_Jenkins"," Very relevant and rewarding

"2349","A beautiful film to watch and perhaps the ultimate ""cup of tea film"".Incredibly English. I really loved the relaxing meditative pace of it, which reminded me of an old-school version of TV show Detectorists.Ralph Fiennes was loveable and effective in his transformation into Basil Brown. Carey Mulligan also delivered an effective, yet understated performance in her roles as Edith. Lily James and Johnny Flynn added an extra layer to proceedings.The most impactful element here was that the film itself began to resemble ""a snapshot"" into the lives of others in a different time and place. The film itself felt like an archaeological dig into the past, with little character studies here and there, lives and loves, just like the dig of the Anglo-Saxon treasure examined history.Recommend for those wanting a perfectly British movie to go with their cup of tea.","8","maccas-56367"," The ultimate cup of tea film

"2351","I loved the film when I watched it - very well acted and interesting! Loved the way it was shot and the music. But I was so disappointed when I researched the real story afterwards and found out how the film had portrayed the women very inaccurately.It depicted the female archaeologist as inexperienced, incompetent and to be honest dithering and pretended that she was only hired because she was lightweight and married to a male archaeologist. In fact she was an experienced and competent archaeologist in her own right. The male photographer was also a completely fictional character added as a love interest - because God forbid we could have a female character who doesn't have a romance! And the two women who really took the photographs were excluded. Very poor!","7","georginacroft"," Great film other than the historical inaccuracies - very sexist

"2352","On the brink of Britain's entry into World War II, self trained archaeologist Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) is sought out by land owner Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) to excavate and investigate what look like ancient burial mounds on her property. Starting out as virtually a one man operation, Brown's early findings pique the interest of the local Ipswich Museum, and eventually gains the attention of Charles Phillips (Ken Stott) of the British National Museum. It's not until the end of the picture that we learn the name of the Sixth Century Anglo-Saxon discovery which came to be known as the Sutton Hoo Treasure, a burial ship with related antiquities dating back much further than originally expected. A number of human interest stories are inserted into the picture to humanize the participants, as Ms. Pretty faces her own mortality with a debilitating illness, while Mr. Brown takes a favorable liking to her young son, an enthusiast of astronomy for which Brown is a willing mentor. As the film progresses, the commoner Brown maintains a stoic resolve against the elitist pretensions of Charles Phillips, and is favored by Ms. Pretty to receive the proper credit for his discovery. The film makers opt to sentimentalize the end of the picture with Britain's entry into World War II, as Ms. Pretty bequeaths the fantastic find as a gift to the British Museum, where it would be seen by the most number of people. Held in safekeeping during the War in an underground location, the Sutton Hoo was finally exhibited nine years after Edith Pretty's death in 1942.","8","classicsoncall"," ""We're digging down to meet the dead.""

"2354","""The Dig"" might be seen by some as a boring period piece. It's true that it doesn't have much to say or move at much of a brisk pace.At the same time, it's a rare film that projects a warm comfort staying put. The relationships between the characters and the ephemeral tone makes this a nice place to spend two hours.Ralph Fienes plays an amateur archeologist constrained by the rigidity of British class (Ralph Fiennes): He's the apotheosis of working class roots who has learned everything of the trade first-hand and is shut out of the mainstream archeological community.His counterpart, Edith (Carey Mulligan), is a young widow of a higher class sitting in a wealthy manor that she would trade for company or a sense of having done something. She loves with a son, a domestic staff she keeps at a distance and a quiet sense of regret over lives she could have lived including that of being an archeologist herself.The event that ties them together is the discovery of a Viking ship beneath her estate. The two form a beautiful platonic relationship (something cinema is severely lacking in) of admiration that bridges class in addition to the fact that one of the two got to fulfill their lives ambitions.As the dig gets bigger, more characters are led into the story which includes a love triangle between Edith's cousin (Johnny Flynn), a junior archeologist from the museum (Ben Chaplin) and his wife (Lilly James) that serves as a reminder of what Edith's life might have been if she indulged in her desires.In the sense that many films might get you excited about a field of knowledge you didn't know much about like blackjack (21), brainwashing (Manchurian Candidate), or nuclear power (the China Syndrome), I left the film without much of a greater education on human archeology except for the most important part: The human stakes involved. Who gets credit for a discovery and can anyone truly deserve it for something someone else built? To what extent is the ability to gain knowledge driven by wealth and access to capital?This is what makes Dig worthwhile.

"2355","I do short simple reviews. This film is about a real life dig, that discovered a major treasure. It took place just before ww2 and dealt with that as well. However, it fictionalized the story adding a homosexual relationship that never occurred in real life and an affair involving the wife of the closeted husband. I feel this was a tacked on ploy that was not true, and was done because that's what Hollywood does. If it was real and Germaine to the real story I would have felt it relevant, but the fact it was made up entirely is a disservice to the people that actually existed. Otherwise good acting, directing, competently made. It's not the best movie ever but intelligent and interesting enough to sacrifice 2 hours.","7","fopfopfop"," Decent film I didn't like the speculative affairs

"
"2362","It is quite amusing to read through negative comments of reviewers who obviously expected an action filled plot of the likes of Indiana Jones. But unlike Mr. Brown's fictional contemporary, the life of an archaeologist is a far cry from Hollywood's take on this humble profession. This film rather adequately depicts the reality of archaeology in the 1930's and 40's, much of which still persists today. The shovel and mattock are more often the tools of choice than the trowel and brush. The tedious and often dull excavation work requires a strong social aspect and comradely on a site sees them through the often miserable work conditions, with inadequate site facilities and unfavourable weather conditions that persist in this part of the world. It is thus no surprise that much of the movie shows these mundane but essential relationships, the human aspect of being an archaeologist. It may come across as being dull but it is ample in accurately portraying archaeology.
The arrogance of some formally trained archaeologists, especially those of high reputation, are legendary and the tension between the excavators and the scholars is portrayed rather well, albeit with a bit of tongue-in-cheek humour. But there are also the difficult diplomatic endeavours to massage some egos and satisfy juxtaposed agendas by various parties involved just so that the excavation can continue. The excitement of finally revealing the secret of a site, not always as sensational as Sutton Hoo - gold and other treasure are a rare occurrence indeed - make up for the all the hardships encountered.
Archaeology during that time often lacked the scientific rigour of modern excavations and this movie adequately depicts this.
The performances are convincing and do the true nature of the profession justice. The set of the excavation has been reconstructed with great care and the archaeology depicted true to the detail. All in all it is a slow but thoroughly enjoyable movie. If you loved Indiana Jones or Tomb Raider then this movie is probably not for you. If you love archaeology as much as I do, then I would highly recommend it for you.","8","heartspill"," Don't expect bull whips and magic trinkets

"2364","As usual, the poor reviews were (it seems to me) written by those who really didn't understand the premise of this movie. Yes, it is about finding artifacts in England at the beginning of WWII, but, in reality it is a character study about the folks who's lives were impacted by this marvelous discovery. With crisp writing and superb acting from all involved, we are transplanted into the lives of ordinary people who stumbled into an extraordinary adventure. Some reviewers complained that too many extraneous characters were introduced at varying times, but, that (it appears) is how the actual events may have unfolded. And all of the characters are treated in a way that tries to explore their own demons and proclivities in a manner which never seems to wander into stereotypes. These were, in fact, average citizens and their lives deserved to be presented in an appropriate way. If you are looking for a documentary portrayal of this event, then you may very well be disappointed. While the plot is, admittedly quite thin, everything else about this movie makes up for it.","9","ricovegas"," Splendid character study

"2370","This is what netflix should do ,this is a good movie and great acting .","8","mattiaslb"," The Dig is beautiful
"
"2371","Acting for motion pictures is a strange occupation. A whole crew of people with their equipment is standing in front of a person pretending they are not there and trying to inhabit a character different than themselves. When all the work is finally done, an audience watches and hopefully is transported away and into a story in an experience similar to a trance. In a really successful film, there are many artists who are considered for the ""technical awards"" and The Dig is one of those, but let me write about one actor.
As an audience, we know instantly when acting is done poorly but sometimes I fear we miss when it is performed so well that it is invisible. Ralph Fiennes (he is Welsh and everyone by now should know - pronounced like Rafe Fines) delivers a performance that is so complete that it is as close to perfection as anything I've ever seen. There is not a millisecond where he is not this ""excavator"". He portrays a simple man who is very complex. He appears to be a common farmer who is really a self-taught intellectual. He is a humble man who knows his worth and wants to be remembered. Honest pride lies under a quiet nature. His job involves shoveling massive amounts of dirt while being directed by his acute scientific mind.
All this is revealed by our actor. The body language, the shuffling gate, the stooped posture of a laborer, but the quick eyes that show his knowledge. He also is a man of his time and not ours. There is something so authentic in the performance that it suggests time travel. He reminded me immediately of the old timers I knew as a boy who are now long dead. Men who never really got all the dirt out of the deep cracks in their hands.
Ralph Fiennes never cries or shouts or has the long soliloquy, but what a transformation! He simply becomes. That, to me, is what screen acting attempts but rarely achieves.","9","brucekuehn"," Ralph Fiennes is quietly astonishing
"
"2372","The Dig isn't a movie I would normally go for, as drama isn't the genre I enjoy the most, but it's also a biography what makes it interesting to watch. It's a story that is worth to be told, that is easy and pleasant to follow. The cinematography is simple but effective, nothing spectacular, just flawless and professional. The acting from the whole cast is what makes this movie a good movie. Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes were both very good in The Dig, but so were the rest of the actors. Just don't expect a lot of action in this movie, it's a drama with an interesting biographical plot.","6","deloudelouvain"," Not bad in this genre.

"2373","This should be viewed as 6.5/6+. The Dig looks great and has a wonderful pacing about it. The entire cast is all quite good in crafting uniquely distinct characters too. The story itself starts off well, with an interesting dynamic developing between the two leads, but about mid-way through it becomes less about them and the dig as a variety of additional characters and side stories appear. I think this weakens and dilutes the beginning storyline and energy but without really adding anything more or equally interesting. Still, it's a very pleasant film and worth checking out if your curious.","6","daoldiges"," Pleasant Dig

"2374","Very well written, directed and acted. Never let you feel bore, it has action of its own. One of the finest movies by Netflix. Must watch for everyone but especially if you are interested in history.","8","fakhar-abbas9"," Gem
"
"2375","Established by early shots, that somehow manage to capture a sky too big for any camera, The Dig reminds viewers that life is more than the ground panning by our stumbling feet. Each and every camera shot is painstakingly placed matching up time of day to the emotions and nuance of the script. One can almost forgive some of the stilted, and all too perfectly worded exchanges late in the film as inconsequential; weighted against the larger picture enveloping the viewer. Yet for every stumble in that script, a verbal polished relic of adoration emerges to further bind image to sound.With the sheer volume and regularity of movies being released in the arms race of streaming services, the script and story are often the lynch pin in weather or not a movie stands appart, and yet, the casting in The Dig almost asks us to forgo these thoughts and coalesce like water colors into a scene simply by the remarkable cast put together by Lucy Bevins. The directorial work Simone Stone cannot be understated here. His vision possibly shines the brightest in how understated yet convincing all of the actors take to their parts. Every actor on display sheds their persona and let the ensamble of characters, story, and music take the forefront.The score by Stefan Gregory fades and crescendos in harmony with the poetry on display continually throughout The Dig's runtime. Comparisons with Jóhann Jóhannsson's exceptional work in Arrival would probably be a solid association for moviegoers that enjoyed that sound scape. The interweaving violin and cello work had my breathe weaving in rhythm as the cinematography constantly impressed.If you are simply a fan of cinema, The Dig will leave you feeling a sense of awe, hope, and comfort, knowing that the form as art is alive and well.","8","noahtaylorvt"," Bigger than just us

"2376","On the outbreak of World War 2 the lady-of-the-house employs an excavator to dig up the Viking mounds in her garden.This is very slow and very gentle - there is zero action.
Don't be fooled by the war setting or clips of spitfires - this is one of those exercise classes you can take sitting down whilst reading a book.
It is also fantastic!The characters are amazing and the acting is superb.
The story is very simple; but because you get to care for all the people involved it has real gravity to it.Issues of the age are there but portrayed in a subtle and meaningful way - a lot of modern movies treat the past in an overly theatrical way, suggesting that anyone who strayed from the ""normal"" was instantly ruined or kicked to death in the street.The British stiff-upper-lip is handled amazingly here - the sacrifices people make to avoid ""causing a fuss"" are significant and heartfelt.
It was nice to see people of the era portrayed as human beings doing what they thought was for the best (even if it wasn't) rather than just evil bullies.
My parents are from that time and, although not as dramatic for screen, their mindset was not so simplistic or barbaric as some would like you to believe.
I really liked the tone of this movie.I watched this with my girlfriend, on a Sunday afternoon after a roast , tucked up on the sofa with snow falling outside.

"2383","And that agenda is writing a script that follows the new rules of what the Academy will consider for their pointless award show, which these days only crowns poor and corporate approved movies.This film moves along swimmingly until the Piggots arrive. Clearly, all is not well, it looks like we have a marriage of convenience, if you get my drift. This subplot, becomes as important and as relevant as the actual excavation as well as Ediths and Basil story .Even though right after the Piggots arrive most of the major treasures are found, its not enough as the script eschews the interesting historical dig which the movie is SUPPOSED to be about, for a romance subplot.I actually realized as I watched the final long scene play out, that they had not even bothered to mention in the movie if a body had been found, or if they had done any digging of the other mounds. You will find more of that information HERE on IMDB trivia page, then in the movie.The movie ALREADY had characters you could care about in Edith, Basil, Robert, and the fictional Rory character, but to try and shoe-horn in the ole romance story on the eve of war trope, all in order to be considered for the Oscars, absolutely ruins the movie.This could have been a LOT better, Ralph Fiennes is nearly wasted here as he become a secondary character, once again AFTER the Piggots show up.This is NOT Oscar material, but then again, if you had told me 2 minutes after watching Parasite that it would later win best picture I wouldnt have believed you.","6","drgreenthumb1001"," Potentially great historic film ruined by an agenda.

"2384","As a current Master's student studying Medieval Art History, I LOVE Sutton Hoo. It's one of my favorite archaeological digs and has some of my favorite art. I was so excited when I saw that this movie came out and was so ready to watch it. I could only make it halfway. It breaks my heart to say it.The way the movie starts feels like you've missed the first 15 minutes of the movie. The slow building of drama and plot was so slow that a movie made by tortoises would have been faster. It has a great cast and the camera work is amazing but I just couldn't get into the story. It was hard to even care about the characters. I grew up on British TV and films, so I recognize that not all movies need to have Michael Bay explosions, but this movie is so dry and dull. I will probably attempt to finish it (if only to see the recreated art work) at a later time when I have lower expectations.","5","alexandriaewhite"," I had such high hopes.

It was slow at times, but only because of the subject matter. Although this takes place during the year leading up to WWII, it is certainly not a war film.Telling a true story without too many sensationalized bits is refreshing. I really enjoyed the movie and felt it didn't need any additional embellishments. Watch it for what it is and you will really enjoy it.

"2393","Simon Stone steers as the helmsman of this project to adapt for the screen a novel by the same name, which is a proper slow burn of a movie only for those with the acquired taste. The Dig is a true adaptation of John Preston's 2007 novel also entitled The Dig which tells the real-life story of how the legendary Anglo-Saxon burial ship, Sutton Hoo was discovered. Starring Ralph Fiennes, Carey Mulligan, and Lily James, we follow all of their individual journeys as they work in tandem bringing to light this historical vessel with performances across the board that are nothing shy of wonderful. An overall strong screenplay by Moira Buffini shows the intricacies and complexities of the entire situation from nearly every angle that at times, does lose its focus causing side stories to overshadow the main plot. The Dig will certainly not be a film for everyone as many may find the subject matter to be plain dull, but it is without question a well-crafted film from opening to closing that will leave you satisfied.Set at the dawn of the Second World War in 1939, The Dig centers around Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) whose land she believes is ripe with treasure just waiting to be found. Given the position she finds herself in, Pretty hires excavator Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) on a recommendation, and he along with a few assistants from the estate work hand in hand to dig into the mounds of Pretty's land to uncover what lies beneath. Following the discovery of a couple of iron rivets that once belonged to a sea vessel, Brown informs Pretty and word of the finding slowly begins to trickle out. Once the news of the site goes public, an excavation team formed by Charles Phillips (Ken Stott) comes forth and begins assisting on the project with hopes that Pretty will sell the ship to the British Museum for all to see. Along the way, outside forces such as investors and buyers all do their best to persuade Pretty's decision making as she suffers from a worsening medical condition which leads to personal strife, Naturally, their collective quest winds up revealing much about every single person who is present doing their part to unearth the Sutton Hoo leading to friction, but ultimately understanding as everyone soon finds their personal peace.The highest mark that can be awarded to The Dig would come in the form of its characters and performances. Every individual character that is introduced throughout the film has a place in the narrative that allows no two characters to serve the same function or feel the same as the next. Although the focus of the film is on a small handful of characters, everyone is given development into their stories which makes them far more believable while giving credence to their motivations from start to finish. All of the details feel purposeful and nothing appeared to be left on the table, so for that, I must give praise to Buffini's exceptional character writing. However, characters and dialogue are only as good as the person bringing them to life. All of the main performers deliver good work that will keep you captivated as they navigate from scene to scene. Ralph Fiennes manages to do a lot with a little as his stoic assuredness bleeds through every word he speaks. Carey Mulligan's tumultuous emotions ebb and flow as she battles with internal and external difficulties all while bringing a deep passion to the screen. Lily James' personal conflict feels fully realized with every moment as she shines in a role that feels utterly soothing. And young star, Archie Barnes delivers a moving performance that will have you experiencing every emotion as he steals nearly every scene he is in. All around, The Dig is a triumph in character, from both the written word to the dedicated performers, not an ounce of talent feels wasted on either side of the camera.The major issues I detected while watching The Dig, came in the form of its pacing and plot. The film has a fairly straight forward story that everyone can understand, but it simply fails to make any of it interesting. Nearly every revelation presented within the film happens seemingly out of thin air with little to no build-up. A series of moments will transpire until something is revealed to the audience but it never feels earned because no gradual development is made, thus making things feel meaningless when you should be feeling elated. On top of that, there are at least two moments throughout the film where a character is turning their back and stepping away from it all, but because a new incentive is placed forth, they return to their duty. On its own, this technique is fine, but when done multiple times for the sake of adding extra scenes of dialogue, it feels terribly pointless. However, the biggest gripe I have with The Dig stems directly from its overall narrative. We are immediately introduced to a small handful of characters from its opening moments who all share a common goal. Then, halfway through the film, a bevy of new characters are introduced with their own stories that are so far removed from the main narrative leading to a shift in what we should and should not care about. When James' character Peggy Piggott was injected into the script I was skeptical at first. However, as her story unfolded, I naturally grew to care for her struggle and subsequent growth more than I ever did with Pretty and Brown's dig. Being far more interested in a romantic side story of a character and the backdrop of the war than the actual excavation is not a good sign. Unfortunately, The Dig has all of the necessary components from dynamic characters to an interesting setting in England just before the birth of the Second World War, but none of it can save the dreadfully dull plot.Simon Stone's The Dig is a film that essentially suffers from a lack of genuine consistency. Buffini's expert screenplay brings Preston's original novel to life through great dialogue, and even greater characters. Every performer gives it their all even if what is being presented is nothing all that engaging. Stone's work behind the camera is fantastic with wide-reaching landscape shots that paint the beauty of the natural world to tracking shots that absorb you into its scenes effortlessly. Tragically, the general story that is being told is one that fails to ""wow"" in any way and it also falls short of connecting the audience to its struggles leaving a significant taste of disappointment in one's mouth. Luckily, the entire film does not drastically suffer because of the flat plot. Yet, I must reiterate, The Dig will not be a film that everyone will enjoy. From its slow pace to droning moments of silence, it can at times have you checking your watch and looking elsewhere. In spite of that, The Dig is a film worth watching full of riveting characters that carry it from start to finish in an excellent fashion.Final Verdict: C","6","westerfieldreviews"," The Unearthing of Fulfillment

"2394","Shortly before the start of WWII, an amateur archaeologist is hired by a widow to excavate the land on her property.A nice historical period drama, without being cheesy, touching and comforting.It's an allegory about death and the legacy left by Man, through relationships and tributes.The style follows the norms of British classics, without being pretentious or overly deconstructing the story, with a 'slow-burner' but exciting rhythm.The photography is fabulous (fun fact: the DoP is the same as in the 2015 film 'Ronaldo'), with beautiful shots of British Surrey landscapes.The performances are in general very good, with a weighted screen time distribution, which allows us to create connections with several secondary characters, and not only with the main ones (Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan).","8","MarcoParzivalRocha"," Such a great find!

"2401","Just watched it on Netflix. Great watch, despite the rather shocking lack of interest in the actual Sutton Hoo objects, which are are barely shown. I was expecting a sort of montage of them over the end credits, but no, all we got was Ralph Fiennes reburying the ship as everyone prepped to hunker down and do their bit for WW2. Very strange omission, especially for international audiences who must wonder at the end what all the fuss was about. Not enough to have a character yell that they proved Anglo Saxons weren't cavemen. Likely revisions in the actual history, particularly regarding ages of participants at the time (Carey Mulligan) sent us scurrying to Google to find out what was true, and what was mayonnaise. A lot of mayonnaise! Especially regarding the romantic subplot, but at least they avoided any Fiennes and Mulligan sexual tension, despite the plot gasping for it, as it were.","9","john-2023"," Er...so, where's the treasure?

The film quietly subverts the comforts of victory, exposing them as a fleeting and superficial state of being. No Viking treasure will free these souls from the inevitability of war.The cast all capture that necessary sense of fragility, as if they could all be snuffed out in an instant. Mulligan's Pretty is a delicately handled performance, as a woman processes grief and loneliness. Similarly Fiennes' Brown is stubborn but a pained character.","7","kevin c"," hidden treasure

The movie is not exactly casual watching. You have to really sit down and wait the movie closely. Some of the dialogue gets heavy, and the little details require a lot of attention to catch.

It's as if the makers thought an archaeologically centred film would be too dry without some kind of love interest. Instead more could have been made of what a narrow escape the Sutton Hoo find had. If it hadn't been found in summer 1939, that piece of land would have been used as a British Army tank training ground a few months later when war broke out. The ship would have been crushed and most or all of the treasure lost forever.","7","ron-newbold"," Good but 5-10 minutes too long

"2410","""Unorthodox and untrained,"" so Basil Brown's (Ralph Fiennes) colleagues call him.The Dig is the true, romantic story of the Sutton Hoo Anglo-Saxon (6th and 7th centuries) artifacts discovered in Suffolk, England 1938-39. Thanks to the owner of the mounds, Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan), and her ""untrained"" excavator, Basil Brown, The National Trust and The British Museum now display a ship and its numerous gold and silver treasures, fit for the king buried with them.Director Simon Stone and writer Moira Buffini, from the John Preston novel, have fashioned an exciting, old-fashioned cinematic history on the events surrounding the dig. The artifacts are only briefly depicted as the real adventure is the determination of Pretty and Brown to give the world a thrill unlike anything since the Tutankhamen Egyptian discovery between 1922 and 1927.Needless to say, local museums and their formally-trained archeologists are disdainful of these amateurs succeeding in the greatest find of anyone's career. The gentle but expert determination of Brown and Pretty is the driving force of the film, yet carefully considerate of the treasure waiting for 3000 years. Their respect of each other and the find is palpable, a model for anyone aspiring to be an excavator of note.The human dimension is the basis of the romance, shown in Pretty's love of her land and the mounds and her affection for Brown, a most competent, reserved, and loving older man. The ever-present threat of WWII hangs over everything, a reality in the fall of 1939 that will suck romance from the globe and make ascendant the evil so opposite the spirit of the dig.Brown's interaction with Pretty's young son, Robert (Archie Barnes), as they observe the sky through Brown's telescope and act a father-son-like relationship, is even more touching than the Brown-Petty connection. These loving connections help confirm the filmmakers' and the authors' intent to connect the past with the present in a strong human bond.In effect, everyone involved in the making of this adventure created a bond with the Anglo-Saxons that navigates the corridor between human civilizations and their future connections somewhere in the cosmos. Just what James Joyce found in the Dubliners' cemetery, ""melancholy unity between the living and the dead.""","unknown_value_please_contact_support","jdesando"," Perfect capture of a most romantic find in history.

The cinematography was beautiful, the dialogue was well written and felt really believable.Now to my issues with the film:To start with, a lot of my criticisms are just things that irritate me personally in films and they're to do with editing. The main ones being:
a) when the music is more dramatic than the scene warrants. The score for this was nice but just like these big, dramatic, orchestral pieces for like most of the film when there was not all that much happening.B) the overuse of the thing where there's dialogue playing over a different scene. This works when the scene happening is relevant to the dialogue or if there's a clear connection or dramatic irony at play or if it's used for like a few seconds as a scene changeover. But this was like long bits of conversation playing over like a bit of a scene that was completely unimportant. Like we're hearing a conversation but seeing the characters walking to the place where they're having that conversation for a really long time for no reason... that just bothers me when it's used frequently in a film, I'd much rather see the conversation that's actually happeningBut my actual main criticism of this film was that I just didn't feel like there was enough story to fill a film. The story and the characters just weren't particularly interesting for me. I don't really feel like I learned anything or took anything away really. I didn't connect emotionally with any of it really and there wasn't really the highs and lows of tension that you expect from a film.And don't get me wrong, I usually love a slow film when it's well done but this just felt like a bit of a waste of time to me so I was disappointed, I was so sure I was going to love this film but...never mind!","5","sspina"," Well done but unnecessary

"2422","""The Dig"" 2021
A made for Netflix period piece, The Dig recalls those dark days as Great Britain prepares to go to war with Hitler's military machine. An amateur, yet skilled archaeologist, Basil Brown, is retained by the wealthy owner of the Sutton Hoo estate to allow him to search for ancient artifacts on her sprawling farm. Mrs. Edith Pretty rankles The British Museum's curator, by selecting Mr. Brown university over degreed archeologists supported by him.
Basil enlists the estate's farm staff and the young son of Mrs. Pretty, Robert, to begin searching for the treasure trove. Her handsome brother Rory (Johnny Flynn) joins the dig and falls in love with Mrs. Pretty's assistant, the lovely (and very married) Peggy Piggott (Lily James). A substantial sub-plot is developed by this entanglement.
Mr. Brown's surprising, father-like mentoring of Robert, is a wonderful second sub-plot, that adds an endearing twist to the story.
Clearly one of the best films of the year, Aussie Simon Stone directs a beautifully flowing tribute to Brown. Stone is best known as an actor, but received praise for 2015's The Daughter, his first directorial outing, which he also wrote.
The Dig is a huge cinematic success; Mike Eley's eye for the simplicity of the land and delicacy of the English countryside is praise-worthy. Stone and Eley both have earned Oscar considerations.
Clearly this is Ralph Fiennes tour-de-force. He makes one genuinely care for his Basil Brown. Fiennes' portrayal of Brown's steadfast allegiance to Mrs. Pretty and her son, really adds to the re-telling of this true story. Cary Mulligan as Edith Pretty is wonderful, as always, playing a character who was fifteen years older than herself.
In this time of the pandemic, The Dig made yet another night stuck at home enjoyable and more interesting. Do yourself a favor and seek out this cinematic joy.","9","peferguson"," One Of The Best of The Year

I knew a young girl with rheumatic fever when I was a teen in the 60's. I learned about the heart problems that can occur from it at that time. Maybe there are those who do not understand where medical science was at that time.
The character development was great. I took away one star as I would have wished this could be viewed by younger people to get a sense of what those days before war was declared.

It shouldn't be. This movie tells the story of arguably the greatest archaelogical find in 20th century Europe. It is a story that is just made for excitement and suspense and triumph. The movie has none of these qualities. It is all told very matter-of-factly. There are a couple of attempts to inject some human interest into the proceedings with a subplot dealing with the health of one character and a perfunctory and unnecessary romance between two others, but sadly it is all just rather dull.I really wanted to like this movie and the best I can say is that I didn't hate it.

He sees the potential for an unprecedented Anglo-Saxon find. When he makes a big discovery, prominent archaeologist Charles Phillips arrives to take over the dig. He brings in married couple Stuart Piggott (Ben Chaplin) and Peggy Piggott (Lily James). Edith calls in her cousin Rory Lomax (Johnny Flynn) to help.This starts slowly as a two star vehicle. I didn't see much potential for great drama. It seems like a small quiet English indie and that would be fine. Quite frankly, the whole cast hasn't even shown up yet. That small story does slowly become more. It becomes a romantic melodrama, an emotional tragedy, a family drama, and a war epic. I think the moment that Lily James shows up is when the movie announces that this movie wants to be bigger. Everybody is performing together to form the story into a beautiful ball of twine.","8","SnoopyStyle"," starts slowly

"2453","How does one respond when they cannot know reality? This is the main question of the Father.The Father is adapted from director Florian Zeller's stage play by the same name. The story centers on Anthony (Anthony Hopkins), an aging man who slowly loses his grip on reality due to dementia. His daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) does her best to care for him, but she too has a life she wants to live-her boyfriend Paul (Rufus Sewell) has asked her to move to Paris with him. Anne struggles to find an aid who can handle her father, so that she can get on with her life. Zeller shared that his inspiration for the film was watching his grandmother, who raised him, pass away from dementia. You can feel the emotion coming through every part of the film.The movie starts with Anne confronting Anthony for chasing off the last assistant. Anthony claims he did it because she stole his watch. Anne patiently reminds him that he put it in his hiding place. She goes and finds the watch in his ""secret"" hiding place. At first, we are able to chuckle about the situation, but we soon become just as confused as Anthony. The tone of the movie shifts when Anthony stumbles upon a man in his flat who claims to be married to his daughter. He waits for Anne to return from the store to sort things out, but when she arrives, she is a different woman entirely.The rest of film has confusing moments like this. Once you think you have sorted things out, they are flipped again. I watched this at the premier at Sundance, and during the Q & A after the film, a woman asked if Anne went to Paris with Paul or not. Zeller responded that we don't know that answer, the answer is not what is important. Zeller stated that he wanted us to be as confused as Anthony and give up on trying to sort things out and just feel. And feel we do.Anthony Hopkins performance drove the emotion. His masterful control of minor expressions and vocal nuance intensified the whole film. I would not be surprised if he wins best actor next year. Zeller admitted that he named the character ""Anthony,"" because he wanted Anthony Hopkins to play the part. (The part was literally written for him.) Anthony's emotions swing in the film driven by his loss of memory and disorientation to events. Everyone seems to be on edge, not knowing how Anthony will respond. One moment he is happy, the next he is distressed. This comes out strongly when Anthony meets Laura (Imogen Poots) for the first time. Laura is a young woman who Anne has set up as Anthony's new caregiver. Anthony begins telling Laura how he used to be a tap-dancer. The scene is funny, and Laura laughs throughout. Suddenly, Anthony remarks that Laura reminds him of his other daughter, because of her inane laughter-and the mood has swung.The key question in the audiences mind is ""What is reality?"" Zeller disorients Anthony and the audience by having different actors play the same characters, then switching back. Zeller rearranges the same apartment, so we are unsure where we are-Anthony's apartment or Anne's. Anthony tells different versions of his career, and we even seem to experience events out of order. The only thing we are certain of is that they don't even speak English in Paris!This is not to say that there are multiple realities, but that Anthony cannot access what the true reality is. As the audience, we become like Anthony-confused. We do not know what his daughter looks like or if she is married. If she is, which man is her husband? However, this confusion over reality is meant to push us beyond discovering the truth and just feeling the helplessness of someone suffering from dementia. And to this point, it works.But, it takes us beyond this. By the end of the film we are all confused. We cannot access what reality is, and now it is time for us to ask, ""How do we respond?"" The film has its answer, but I'll leave it up to you to feel if you agree. This is one film that has to be watched to appreciate, because it focuses on the feeling of the experience and not the truth of the experience.A couple extra notes:
First, Zeller shared that the classical music that Anthony listens to throughout the film is Hopkins's favorite music. Hopkins always wanted to be in a movie that used this music, and now he got the chance.Second, often movies adapted from stage plays can feel very confined and unnatural to the screen. Events that would naturally lead a character elsewhere seems to falsely confine them to that space, since the play needs to keep them there. However, Zeller does a nice job at expanding the world and making the small space feel new. Most of the film takes place in the apartment, but because of the rearrangement and use of different rooms in the apartment, it feels larger and natural.","9","joshuaporteous"," How does one respond when they cannot know reality?

"2456","IN BRIEF: Great performances and sensitive direction create a haunting journey into dementia.JIM'S REVIEW: (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) It's been a few days since I have seen Florian Zeller's brilliant film, The Father, and it still haunts me with its vivid depiction of the ravages of dementia. Other films have previously tackled this tragic disease very well. Amour, Still Alice, Away From Her, Iris, these exceptional films do come to mind, but no moviegoing experience will prepare you for this emotional free-fall.We witness Anthony's mental decline directly as we are transported to his ever-changing world. It is a jarring and disturbing view. Scenes are flipped and repeated by different characters. Actors trade roles and utter familiar dialog heard before. Items are lost or found and settings are slightly askew with changes in decor hinting at his mental disarray and anguish. As moviegoers, we cannot recognize the real from the surreal and the film accomplishes what no other film has done before...we become as dead to the real world, just as Anthony has, lost in a parallel universe and unable to find an easy escape. The emotional upheaval is palpable and moving.This is a great movie. French playwright Florian Zeller takes his play (with the assistance from Christopher Hampton) and adapts it for the screen in his glorious directorial debut and it's a stunner. His dialog captures the outrage and angst of a patient slowly being erased. Mr. Zeller's sensitive touches throughout the film indicate vast changes in Anthony's time frame (a misplaced fork, artwork that moves and shifts placement in the apartment, a whole kitchen redo, etc.).Production values are top-notch. Special kudos to Peter Francis' stylish production design and Ludovico Einaudi's brooding and lyrical music score which sets the perfect bittersweet tone. Yorgos Lamprinos removes all of the play's stagy theatrics from this adaptation with his concise editing and the lens of Ben Smithard lights and composes areas of the apartment with a sense of cluttered isolation with equal parts Edward Hopper or David Hockney.In the title role is Sir Anthony Hopkins and he is mesmerizing in his portrayal of a man unable to come to terms with his demise. He cajoles, bullies, and demands attention of those he loves. His final break-down scene is a masterclass in acting. This is a towering performance by an actor at his peak. The whole ensemble is splendid. Rufus Sewell, Imogen Poots, Mark Gatliss, and Olivia Williams shine in their transferable identities and add layers to the story, but it is Olivia Coleman as Anne, Anthony's sorrowful daughter, who impresses. The actress brings such deep nuance to her part. Her frightened glances, disoriented manner, and expressive line delivery is devastating. Mr. Hopkins and Ms. Coleman deserve every accolade this award season.Simply stated, The Father is one of the year's finest films. Do not miss this gripping movie.","10","jadepietro"," A Haunting and Devastating View of Dementia

"2461","And then you get Anthony Hopkins in THE FATHER. This is a devastatingly, heartbreakingly-brilliant performance and a great film. Hopkins' range is incredible. He goes from charming and funny to menacing to wholly lost in seconds. From man to child on a dime. It's a powerful rumination on a terrifying disease, bolstered by Sir Tony at his finest, a strong supporting turn from Olivia Colman, and an excellent script by Christopher Hampton and Florian Zeller (based on Zeller's play). It's a daring move to tell the story from the perspective of Hopkins' character as his mind increasingly deteriorates. A savvy one too, as the audience is forced to engage to truly understand what is real, who is who, and where precisely we are in our protagonist's gut-wrenching journey. This may be Hopkins best work, a late-career revelation that once again reminds us why he's one of our finest cinematic performers. Be warned. If you've ever been touched by the tragedy of dementia, this film could wreck you.","9","historiafilms"," Sometimes You Forget How Great an Actor Is ...

"2465","This is one of the hardest movie reviews I've ever had to write in my life.Mainly because of the films subject matter, Dementia.I've seen my own father succumb to this dreaded disease and it scares the hell out of my, worse than any horror movie I've watched.I sadly remember some of the last words my own father spoke to me were, ""Be a good boy at School today.""
I was 46 at the time.The beauty of ""The Father"" is how Director, Florian Zeller, takes you into this descent of losing your grip on reality through the eyes of the marvellous veteran and Academy Award wining actor, Sir Anthony Hopkins.At times his character Anthony is part Hannibal Lecter and at others a peaceful, but confused ageing Father to Olivia Colmans, Anne.Another Academy Award winner who puts in a highly believable performance as his daughter who's trying to deal with helping a man who refuses to accept assistance from her or carers.Fun Fact: Colman was named Anne is both roles she's been Oscar nominated for.Also great supporting roles form Mark Gatiss, Olivia Williams, Imogen Poots and Rufus Sewell.Overall ""The Father"" has been nominated for 6 Oscars, after already having over 20 wins in other awards and once you've seen this film you'll know why it deserves to win in Hollywood.At 83, Hopkins, is the oldest winner of a Best Male Actor BAFTA and a dark horse to scoop up the big one.This film feels like everything he has learnt in his craft is on display effortlessly for 97 minutes.It's hard to believe this is Zellers' feature film directorial debut, because it's a masterclass in cinema adapted from his own acclaimed play ""Le Pere"" from 2012.The role of Anthony was specifically written for Hopkins.One of the things that got the living legend to agree to this film apart from the top shelf script (adapted by Christopher Hampton) was the inclusion of one of Hopkins favourite pieces of music from Georges Bizet Opera ""The Pearl Fishers"".He's always dreamt of making a movie with this music in it.With lines from Anthony like: ""I feel as if I'm losing all my leaves"" ""The Father"" is so close to perfect I'm giving it 10 stars.","10","waltermwilliams"," So close to perfect and so personal

She is soo good in emitting emotions to the screen that she could do that with her mimicking alone, no words needed. Seeing sorrow in her eyes while looking after the man who raised her is just hard to watch. But the preformanse at the end of the film given by the veteran of cinema sir Antony Hopkins is just OUT OF THIS WORLD. I never felt that way while watching a movie. It was like a giant stone was pressed on my chest and i started sobbing like a child, first time after untimely death of my father 10 years ago. Thanks God I watched the movie alone.

"2468","I hope Zeller moves from the theatre to film full time because this thing is sublime. Dementia (Alzheimer's disease) runs through both sides of the family, I've seen the disease full throttle. It is nasty and heart-breaking; it destroys everyone around the person suffering.I've a big soft spot for almighty performances. I get a buzz off seeing an actor harness everything in their being to master the craft (DDL in There Will Be Blood; PSH in Capote, The Master). Hopkins is 83; he delivers an absolutely abnormally outrageous performance. One in which, if you're watching it right, will linger long after. It's mesmerising.But to oversell on the acting alone is to do Zeller a disservice. Coleman is also great. The film and its script (adapted from the stage) is just beautiful. It sucks you in, allowing you to fully realise the disease in all its terrible, and dare I say it, funny, contradictions. I wouldn't want to spoil this for anyone. I reckon you should go for it; the worst that can happen is you turn it off after 20 minutes when you realise it's not for you. It was for me. Utterly brilliant.","10","Rytl"," Best film of 2020/21?

"2469","I had the wonderful opportunity to see The Father at CIFF this year. I went in excited to see what Sir Anthony Hopkins would do with a study on dementia. As I consider Sir Anthony as arguable the best actor in film these days I had pretty high expectations. And I was not at all let down. When his character, also named Anthony, become confused or curmudgeonly you recognize some of his other great performances. But in fact I was most impressed at how warm and charming of a character Sir Anthony could also play. He was just simply spell binding when his character was his ""old self"". With all this being said perhaps the most remarkable performance of the film comes from Olivia Colman who plays Anthony's daughter, Anne. The patience, frustration, hurt and unwavering love depicted while Anne tries to find the best way to care for her father is truly remarkable. I'm sure there will be Oscar buzz for both of these performances and for the adapted screen play of Director Florian Zeller.
Now a little SPOILER to help people better enjoy this film. The Father in a way is shot like a mystery. Time lines are repeated , characters change in the story all while the audience sits confused. You do by the end understand that this is done to represent the progression of Anthony's disease. And you as an audience get to experience the strangeness of a mind that is being let down by itself. This is presented as a kind of plot twist. But I think the film will be more enjoyable for most if you understand in advance what is going on.","9","TrueWouve"," And the Oscar goes to...

"2472","This film should be watched as a lesson/warning to help understand the curse of Alzheimers/Senility.My dad developed Alzheimers and over the years became a different man to the one I knew. It started with little things. He'd 'lose' his wallet. A couple of times he'd take the cash from Ma's purse and 'lose' it. He had worked as a plumber. One day I went to visit him. As I opened the front door I smelt gas. There was dad,in the front room with a stripped out gas fire,about to use a blow torch. That was the day Ma told me she couldn't cope and so I moved back home to help look after him. Slowly he got worse. He'd go out early in the morning for walks. Sometimes in just his underwear. Once he managed to leave the house and we ended up having to call the Police. They found him. I started staying awake most nights to watch him. I was already an insomniac. Watching him change from my dad into someone who didn't know me was difficult. The Dr's told Ma that dad needed to go into a 'care' home. We had to have him 'committed'. I have always regretted that. He was visited everyday whilst in the 'care' home. When he was living at home I had given up my job to care for dad and so I could spend several hours with him daily. We'd go for walks. Have a fish & chips lunch. By this time I was almost a stranger to him. Occasionally he'd think I was his brother. Though he always spoke of the sons who never bothered to visit him. Ma would quite often have to buy dad a new watch as he'd 'lose' them. The hardest part of this cruel disease for us was that dad,like the man in this film,had forgotten that his daughter had been killed in a traffic accident 20 years before. He'd often ask where she was. We never told him the truth. There were times when he became violent(something the illness seemed to bring out in him). Sometimes dad would have a lucid moment. It always surprised me when he called me by my name. Those were the times that became really special to me. I'd ask him questions about his life. Those moments only lasted a few mins. I used to wonder what dad would say if,during a lucid moment,I had shown him a video of the man he had become. I'm fairly certain he'd have asked me to put him out of his misery. He was always a very proud man.","10","csigrissom-57506"," Lost In Your Own Mind

"2473","One of my all time favorite movies is Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York which narrates the ever deteriorating world around a playwright bordering on reality and insanity. And Florian Zeller's The Father is the closest I've seen that captures the insanity of the decaying mind, but told through the apparatus of a very real and universal issue.The movie was unsettling from start to finish... in the best way possible. It's one that shows the unstable world around the aging Anthony, but with the underlying vigilance that what's ""wrong"" is not necessarily the world around him. And the horror of one's rationality clinging on to his very last bit of sanity is shown in the most surprisingly human way possible, and it's what makes The Father one of the finest movies of the year.Special credits to stars Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, who undoubtedly make the movie as every bit emotional and human. And Hopkins' performance in this movie is by far my favorite of the year. Overall, a very intense yet rewarding viewing experience that no one should miss out on. Do yourselves a favor and check it out!!!","10","isaacsundaralingam"," Probably the only movie I've seen that discusses aging and dementia in any meaningful capacity

"2475","""Why do you keep looking as if there's something wrong? Everything's fine.""The Father follows a man suffering from memory problems as he refuses all assistance from his daughter as he ages. As he tries to make sense of his changing circumstances, he begins to doubt his loved ones, his own mind and even the fabric of his reality. I honestly don't know where to begin. This is a mind-bender for the ages. Florian Zeller adapted his play into a screenplay along with Christopher Hampton. Naturally, Zeller also directed the film as well. Had he not collaborated on this project, I don't think it would ever be the same. He brought so much to this through his writing and directing. The way he made this confusing for both the viewers and Anthony (Anthony Hopkins' character) only enhances the experience. The first 30 minutes had me questioning everything I was watching. More questions are answered as the film continues but not in the most conventional way. We have to piece everything together. Any when I say everything I mean literally everything. Characters, timelines, location, just everything. It's not till the last moments where absolutely everything comes together in a way that makes sense. The screenplay is strong in the sense of storytelling, though a little bit of clarity would've been nice at a couple parts, but the dialogue is even stronger. The scenes that Anthony Hopkins are in-and it's basically every scene-he has hefty monologues. Every single scene is an award winning scene for both the actors, writing, and directing. Zeller directs the hell out of every scene. He gets the most out of the actors through expression and blocking. I find that those who have worked with stage production, whether it's writing or directing, have a way of knowing how to send a message through the screen. I know the awards shows don't favor stage-to-screen directing as much but I hope Zeller can pull through.Now if Anthony Hopkins doesn't win almost every award for his role, I'm going to be furious. If he doesn't win the Oscar it might go down as one of the biggest snubs in history. The only exception would be if Chadwick Boseman wins and it seems that they are going to campaign him in lead instead of supporting now. Hopkins goes through every emotion possible and takes the viewers with him. And like I said before, every scene he's in jail an award worthy scene. The very last scene had my pillow soaked in tears. The realistic acting and dialogue immersed you into the film and you forget this is acting. The same can be said for Olivia Colman. It's funny how she didn't become a household name until The Favourite. Now there's another chance she will get another Oscar. That is if she can beat Glen Close a second time. We, assuming you don't have severe memory problems, can associate with her character the most. She just wants what's best for her father but struggles to deal with his condition every day. Almost al of her scenes are heavy with emotional dialogue. Emotional doesn't always mean sad or angry, but the emotion put in to make the performance realistic is always evident. The rest of the cast does great as well. They don't have that much screen time, with the exception of Imogen Poots, but they use every minute they have. Speaking of Imogen Poots, I love to see how much she's grown as an actress. Every role keeps getting better and better. If she wasn't in the shadow of Colman, she very well could have a fair shot for awards nominations.It's hard to express words for The Father. It's been over a week since I watched it and I still can't stop thinking about it. Once it finished I considered watching it again. Even though I had three classes the next day, I should've watched it again. Time flies by so fast while watching. What felt like 30 minutes turned out to be an hour. But it's the use of time that's done so well. Both in the sense of runtime and the time in the film, the execution couldn't have been better. When this comes out, whether it's in theaters or online, please, please, please watch The Father!","9","sweidman-28016"," Nearly Perfect

"2477","I haven't seen the play on which ""The Father"" is based, (or indeed the other two plays in Florian Zeller's trilogy on the family), but as cinematic adaptations go this is as good as it gets. Taking place almost entirely on a single set, this is an actor's piece of the highest order and its linchpin is a magnificent performance from Anthony Hopkins as ""The Father"" of the title, a man suffering from advanced dementia and perhaps, both in Hopkins's performance and Zeller's treatment of the subject, this will come to be seen as the definitive film on dementia as anyone with personal experience can testify.Everything is seen through Hopkins' eyes. Olivia Coleman, (heartbreakingly good), is his daughter but there are other 'characters' who may or may not exist or rather, if they do exist, who are they or who does Hopkins perceive them to be? A man appears who says he's the daughter's husband but then the daughter has said she does not have a husband. Another woman comes in and says she's his daughter while another man appears and converses with Hopkins. Is he the husband? Is there a husband?I've already said that this is an actor's piece of the first order but it is also a writer's piece with Zeller adapting his own play with Christopher Hampton. It may be mystifying initially for just as characters turn up to confuse us so the film follows no chronological timespans. Events keep repeating themselves if they happen at all until we come to realise we are simply inside Hopkins' dishevelled mind and for Hopkins I think I can safely say that this is a career- best performance. The Oscar givers may ignore it but acting like this deserves more than prizes; it deserves to be seen.","10","MOscarbradley"," Hopkins has never been better.

"2481","IN A NUTSHELL:
This is a heartbreaking movie that really hit home for me because my own parents are aging and requiring extra help. My mother has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, my step-mom with Parkinson's, and both my father and step-father are struggling with dementia. For me, this film was painful to watch, yet I recommend it. It's extremely well made. Kudos to director Florian Zeller who is making his directorial debut full of Oscar Buzz. The movie is directed by Florian Zeller and stars Academy Award-winning actors Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Coleman.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Kids will be extremely bored. So will some adults.
Profanity and F-bombs.THEMES:
Family
Aging
Alzheimer's
Trust
Sacrifices for family
Supporting aging people
RealityTHINGS I LIKED:
And the Oscar goes to... Anthony Hopkins is a national treasure. He's sure to be nominated for Best Actor for an Academy Award and will probably win. Director Florian Zeller wanted Anthony Hopkins for this part and said he wouldn't have made this film without him. Zeller is a French playwright who had adapted his play ""Le Pere"" from 2012 into this movie.
Academy Award-winning Olivia Coleman sure has been busy lately! While pumping out episodes of the dramatic TV masterpiece The Crown - Season 03, she also filmed this movie. I just adore her and think she's superb in everything she does.
Some viewers will be very confused watching this, but that's absolutely intentional and brilliant. You will get a taste of how Alzheimer's feels.
The editing team will probably also earn an Oscar nomination for creating dreamlike scenes and transitions that mimic what an aging brain experiences.
It's heartbreaking and spellbinding.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:

The Father
Base on the stage play by the same name, director Florian Zeller adapts his own play to the big screen, telling the story of Anthony (Sir Anthony Hopkins), an elderly man dealing with severe case of Alzheimer disease with some stages of dementia and his daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) who tries her best to take care of her father.With the help of an unconventional script and some illusion-inducing cinematic techniques, we are seeing the most parts of the film from Anthony's viewpoint. Some scenes repeats themselves with completely another character replaced, some elements form the set are altered or entirely disappeared, even the house Anthony is living in may change completely and through these modifications we get to experience the dementia that is affecting Anthony (or many real life people for that matter) and his sense of perception.This film makes brilliant use of every part and aspect to tell its story in the most compelling and intriguing way possible. Both performances by Hopkins and Colman are phenomenal and writer/director Zeller knows exactly what he wants to do and does it with eagerness and care. It is not certainly enjoyable per se, but it is surely thought-provoking and memorable.","8","mbrcf"," A magnificent work
"
"2489","It's so uncommon for an actor of Hopkins' talent and reputation to achieve quite possibly the best performance of his career so deep into it. He's acted brilliantly for so long and I don't mean to undermine anything he's ever accomplished in the past, but normally by now actors start phoning it in. But wow. He was not.This film was devastating to watch. In the best way possible. From the acting - which was lead by Hopkins but was not just great because of him! - to the writing, directing, scoring, editing, cinematography on and on and on everything was amazing! The only reason I did not give it a perfect 10/10 is because I so rarely give them out I'm afraid to act too rashly and give it out too soon but trust me... I may end up doing just that.As someone who has experienced the subject matter of this film personally in my family I cannot express how painfully accurate every little detail was in the writing and in Hopkins' beautiful performance. The confusion, the anger, the regret, the brutal honesty and lack of self awareness, the fear, the bipolar nature was all so frighteningly accurate that I forgot many times that I was watching a film not a documentary or even real life.I don't say this lightly.. this may not only be the best film of the past year but of the past decade. Absolutely amazing.","9","SimonsRants"," Was it... Perfect?

"2490","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I've watched some incredible films during my life. Some offered me a blast of pure entertainment, others left me crying like a baby, and dozens made me laugh uncontrollably. Nevertheless, the most memorable movies are the ones that profoundly impact me emotionally either by remembering me of a past phase of my life or by possessing main characters who I can strongly relate to. What might be ""just another film"" for most viewers can ultimately become a personal journey for other people in the audience, which is how I partially experienced The Father. I didn't have massive expectations for the movie itself, but I was curious to know how great Anthony Hopkins would be.While the legendary actor is undoubtedly a notable standout, Florian Zeller's creative, unconventional storytelling left me completely floored. By the end of the film, I felt emotionally drained of all my feelings and thoughts due to the increasingly heavier, devastating narrative co-written by Zeller and Christopher Hampton, adapted from the former's award-winning play, Le PÃ¨re. This could have been yet another generic story about dementia, but Zeller's brilliant storytelling places the viewer in the protagonist's skin, offering a terrifying viewpoint of the disease. From the very first minute until the end, the spectators accompany Anthony, an old man starting to lose track of reality, through his own perspective.I genuinely don't know if this sort of point of view has been depicted before, particularly in the case of dementia, but either way, it's a harrowing experience that will surely leave a vast majority of its viewers extremely captivated throughout the entire runtime. Watching Anthony go through scenes that he wholly believes are indeed happening as he sees them is as attention-grabbing as it is frustrating and sad once the audience gets to see how the same scenes really played out. In fact, if one starts watching the movie without even knowing the synopsis, the first act will almost seem like a mystery-thriller due to so many twists and turns regarding previous conversations that Anthony and the viewers believe are 100% real.Zeller and Hampton's script doesn't only approach Anthony's feelings but also the loved ones surrounding him, which I firmly believe was both necessary and honest. The Father doesn't shy away from showing the boiled-up frustration and even desperation that the family usually goes through when dealing with someone with this terrible health condition. I have no words to describe how thoughtful and impactful Zeller's storytelling method ends up being. I found myself remarkably surprised once I realized the film had reached the one-hour mark. The control of the movie's pacing and tone is absolutely seamless. Technically, Yorgos Lamprinos' editing work is as impeccable as Ben Smithard's lingering cinematography.However, it's Ludovico Einaudi's outstanding score that steals the spotlight in the technical realm. From the atmospheric, grand opera music to the more subtle tracks, Einaudi makes sure to elevate the critical moments with a noticeable sound that helps the viewer understand the progressive shift in Anthony's perception of reality. Zeller demonstrates immense talent in his feature film directorial debut. Being an adaptation from his own play certainly aids him in bringing the story from stage-to-screen, but his filmmaking choices are worthy of recognition, such as the extensive use of long takes to let the actors shine in their layered roles. And since I mentioned the cast...Anthony Hopkins delivers an award-worthy performance that only finds in Chadwick Boseman (Ma Rainey's Black Bottom) a serious rival for this year's awards season. Hopkins holds countless astonishing displays throughout his career, but this one is definitely one of my favorites. I never anticipated I'd shed so many tears by watching an old man cry or getting slapped in the face, though it's not even due to the acts themselves but to everything that builds up those moments. During most of the runtime, I don't really feel sadness or anger. Instead, I feel every character's pain because it's incredibly hard to watch how everyone deals with the situation. Hopkins and Olivia Colman are undoubtedly the most impactful, but Olivia Williams and Imogen Poots also add a lot to the sentimental component.I insinuate above that The Father impacted me at a personal level. A little bit about my life: my grandfather didn't have dementia, but his mind slowly deteriorated until it reached a point where he had to spend his last few months on this planet stuck in a bed without really talking or moving. Still to this day, part of me regrets not spending that much time with him near the end, while the other part feels a bit relieved that my memory of him in his ""normal"" state remains intact. I always feared that if I visited him often in his last days of living, I'd only remember his time at the nursing home instead of the years packed with tremendously essential lessons he taught me. This movie left me sleepless, spending the night thinking about that time of my life...The Father is an overwhelmingly devastating depiction of the painfully progressive disease that is dementia. Florian Zeller's extremely captivating storytelling places the viewers inside the protagonist's mind, making the audience witness and feel everything through his unclear perspective. Zeller and Christopher Hampton deliver a brilliantly unique screenplay packed with emotional punches that will leave no one indifferent. From the perfect editing to the persistent camera work, it's Ludovico Einaudi's gorgeous, impactful score that elevates the big moments. Zeller's use of long takes feels both necessary and important to attach the viewers' attention to Anthony Hopkins, who delivers an award-worthy, powerfully compelling performance. One of my favorites of his entire career. Hopefully, this will be the closest I'll ever be to experience this mental condition. My personal connection to this film justifies why I'll offer it my highest rating since November 2019 (Ford v Ferrari). One of the best movies I've seen in the last couple of years. Do not miss it!Rating: A+","10","msbreviews"," The Father is an overwhelmingly devastating depiction of the painfully progressive disease that is dementia.

"2496","THE FATHER is one of the most powerful films in recent memory, with two knockout performances from Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman. Hopkins plays an old man who is plagued by dementia, and who is refusing care from his daughter, played by Colman, because he believes that he can take care of himself adequately on his own. The movie is structured from the perspective of Hopkins -- the audience often sees things in a non-linear fashion and is not introduced to certain major characters, making them just as strange to us as they are to Hopkins in his mind.The writing from Florian Zeller is impeccable, managing to be creative while also giving us a devastating look into how it feels to suffer from dementia. While it sometimes feels just as much like a play as a movie, it never bores the audience with any superfluous details and implores the audience to attempt to find their way through a maze that has no ending. The editing and direction makes us feel as though we are being deceived, making us empathize with Hopkins while also siding with his caretaker, who is doing everything she can to care for her sick father.The performances are the best of 2020, with Hopkins being possibly the best he has been on-screen in decades. (If Chadwick Boseman weren't such a strong contender for lead actor, I'd say give the Oscar to Hopkins.) Colman, however, may be my pick for best supporting actress, because she portrays the pain of watching a loved one slip into confusion and paranoia with heartbreaking reality.The final ten minutes of the movie are my favorite scenes acting-wise of the past year.

"2499","Now this is what I would call the Best Picture of 2020 and Anthony Hopkins surely deserved his Oscar for such a complex character he portrayed.As I was watching the movie, it was as if I was in Anthony's head, trying to figure out heads and tails of everything that was going on: who am I, where am I, what's my story, who are the people around me, is it my apartment, what happened ten minutes ago, and finally, is it real at all? The cinematography is fantastic, how the transitions are made up into one big loop of events that round up to make sense but in the end nothing really makes sense when you're losing your memory to a weary old mind.I guess it will take multiple watches for me to look out for all of the details I missed to make a picture to at least seem whole but as of now The Father is a perfect representation of what's really happening inside the head of an old sick man and Sir Anthony played his part gracefully and was very touching. So did Olivia Colman and all the rest of the cast.Overall I feel like there's so much left for me to discover in this movie and this is literally the best thing about the art of cinema: that it puts a seed of wisdom or a thought into your brain and let it blossom naturally, and, when the movie is as great as this one is, with every new rewatch it will give your tree of thoughts more and more branches, colors and beauty.","10","jamesjustice-92"," Where is my mind?

"2504","I'm a big fan of Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, so I was really looking forward to this one after it got rave reviews out of Sundance. This film is based on a stage play, and centers around a woman in a relationship who visits her aging father, who is beginning to show signs of dementia, in London due to concerns that he can no longer take care of herself. Narratively, it's not always as memorable as one would hope, but the strong performances and careful direction carry the film home at the end of the day and overall craft something certainly worth watching.Anthony Hopkins is undoubtedly terrific here. He is able to convey both frailty yet genuine shock and empathy, while trying to better understand those around him that even he regularly connects with. Colman's performance is compassionate yet multi-layered, conveying clear emotional depth. The film's aesthetic is simple, modest and unpretentious, yet it manages to skillfully and quietly play a role within the film as a whole by adding to an atmosphere of confusion about what is real and what is not real due to Hopkins' character's dementia. The screenplay is generally well-written, but the dialogue is not quite as sharp or powerful as one would hope. Despite a fleeting running time, the film is leisurely paced, which is fine because it allows viewers the ability to take in the details of the characters' interpersonal relations. Yet while very moving in parts, the story doesn't quite build up to a true emotional crescendo that one would expect from a powerful, character-driven drama. That said, the acting combined with a thoughtful tone of generally subdued reverence makes the film very worthwhile viewing. 7.5/10","7","bastille-852-731547"," Well-acted dementia drama

"2510","We often hear that health is the most important thing. The older we get, the more we realize that as our backs start to feel stiff in the morning or our knees begin to ache from driving. Mental health is different because you might feel that you are in tip-top shape while in reality, those around you have been trying to cope with your symptoms for a long time. The Father is a story of an old man who is stubborn about moving to an elderly home and instead chooses to live in his daughter's flat. Or does the daughter live in his flat?He isn't quite sure where he actually lives as each day the surroundings seem to change without his consent. Despite that, he is going about his business as if everything is normal while in reality it's far from that and his daughter is the one who is heartbroken because her father is not in his right mind.It's obvious that the events are tragic but because of how Anthony acts and the way in which the film presents his ""adventures"", it feels ok to laugh. As a matter of fact, Hopkins wants you to laugh up until a certain point where both his acting and the film's mood signify that things have become quite serious. ""Where has all my life gone?"" - he says and at that instant, you can't help but feel a certain pain in your heart. What's more, your head will begin to spin in an attempt to connect the small pieces to the big picture.We all know that Sir Anthony Hopkins is a Titan of acting but he seemingly disappeared during the last decade. Turns out he has been saving up his acting for the right role and this outstanding performance puts him right next to Riz Ahmed in the lead to win the Oscar. Oh, and Olivia Colman managed to surprise once again. Like many of Sir Anthony's movies, this one is filled both intelligence and profound depth which makes you want to watch it more than once. The tricky part is that the emotions of the first experience are not so easy to get over.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and tv revirws","9","arabnikita"," The whole cinema sat and watched the credits roll

"2511","In daily life, there are a lot of things that change very fast. We can't stop time, everything is changing around us. Sometimes a healthy mind might have be missed the changes or might refuse them. In this script, we see this changes through the eyes of an old man. The old man that can't adapt the changes as fast as the speed of change. There is no one reality for this man. He just splashes in the timeline and find out the thinks just he can remember. With magnificent acting of Antony Hopkins, we watch the old man's despair.

"2515","When I started watching an Oscar movie with the incomparable Sir Anthony Hopkins I didn't know what ""I'm getting into""!The Father -2020 is a film that does not make you feel good but makes you deeply sad, it makes you go through all the possible states and even makes you think that ... you never know what fate is preparing for you!Quite static (taking place in 3-4 rooms and a long hallway) the film becomes dynamic due to the fact that the action takes place, in fact, in the ravaged mind of a father with Alzheimer's.Incredible and terrifying is the illustration in images of the darkness in the mind of a confused man: the plans overlap, the rooms change, the characters are or are not what they seem ... everything is unclear ... and in the center of all is always him, the old man with a confused and confusing smile on his lips.I don't think he would have been another better actor for this role. Even the writer / director Florian Zeller didn't think otherwise, offering the script since 2017 to the great actor and refusing to make the film without him (the character's name is Athony because it can only be his) Ffff inspired choice because Hopkins is masterful! Merit that was recognized this year with an Oscar (the actor has another for Silence of the Lambs - 1991) being the oldest actor who received this distinction at 84, dethroning him (if you can say that even though everyone has well-established place in the panoply of great actors as well as in our hearts) Christopher Plummer who was awarded at the age of 82.Olivia Colman (as Anne's daughter) is slightly overshadowed by Hopkins' overwhelming personality (who wouldn't she be ?!) yet she plays a wonderful role.The film also has parts in which music plays an important role, Hopkins being a great lover of classical music and even singing the piano. The area from Bizet's ""Pearl Fishermen"" was chosen for the film at his suggestion, being one of his favorites.I don't think there is much more to say about this film (it ""took my maul"" anyway as they say) and I don't even know if it would be good to recommend it to people who have old or sick parents or to young people who don't he would (still) understand its depth.""The Father"" is such a realistic movie that it's good to put on a list and watch only when you have the necessary mood but ... by no means ignored!","9","alexandraza"," A FATHER HARD TO FORGET

"2517","The Father is a difficult film to review. It is not an easy film to watch, but it is not an exploitative trauma film like so many other movies and shows out there right now. In some ways, The Father is the scariest horror film that I have ever seen. You need to be emotionally prepared to watch this film and the Alzheimer's disease reality that it presents. This is not a ""date night"" movie. Schindler's List has more lighthearted moments in it than The Father.Do not let these comments discourage you from watching The Father, though. If you are a fan of cinema and the wide breadth of emotions that it can elicit, The Father is simply a jaw-dropping exposition into the very raw emotions that this disease can, and has, inflicted on countless generations of families, including my own. You will probably not want to re-watch The Father as soon as it is finished, and that is okay. It reminds me of Requiem for a Dream (2000) in that both films are very emotionally powerful, but I was not dying to see either of them again right after I saw them the first time. Some films are better left to marinate on our consciousness, and The Father is certainly one of those.","10","TruthTeller98765"," The Best Movie of 2021 (I watch a lot of movies, FWIW)

"2519","Greetings again from the darkness. Dementia and Alzheimer's disease are frequent topics in movies these days for the simple reason that so many are impacted either directly or through a friend or family member. The importance of memory to our core being cannot be over-stated. It's crucial to who we are and what we feel. The first feature film from French director Florian Zeller is an excellent and poignant tale, all too real for those who have experienced this with a loved one. Zeller adapted his own play (winning a Tony Award for Frank Langella) with his co-writer, Oscar winner Christopher Hampton (DANGEROUS LIASONS, 1988). It's also one of the few films where Set Design is so crucial that it basically serves as a main character.Whereas most of these movies provide the perspective of the caregiver or family members, this one is extraordinary in also giving us the point-of-view of the one suffering. Sir Anthony Hopkins (Oscar winner, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, 1991) plays Anthony, an 80 year old Londoner who gets hurt, defensive and a bit churlish when his daughter Anne (Oscar winner Olivia Colman, THE FAVOURITE, 2018) informs him that she's met a man and is moving to Paris. Anne is working to find an acceptable caregiver for her father ... one that he doesn't run off in a matter of hours. Though Anne maintains a spirited front, it's clear the responsibility is exhausting and draining - feelings of which any caregiver can surely relate.Just about the time we get a feel for the flow and settle in for a family drama, filmmaker Zeller spins things topsy-turvy. We suddenly aren't sure 'what is what' or 'who is who'. Olivia Williams (THE SIXTH SENSE, 1999) is now Anne. She now has a husband, Paul - maybe Mark Gatiss or Rufus Sewell. The details of the apartment are slightly different, and instead of being Anthony's place, it's actually Anne's. Or is it? Anthony tries to process these differences, just as we do. The interview with an in-home caregiver played by Imogen Poots brings out the joy and liveliness of Anthony, but a painting raises questions ... as does the ongoing saga with Anthony's favorite wristwatch. As viewers, we are baffled and disoriented; however, unlike Anthony, we are slowly able to process the flashes of data and slowly put the pieces together.Anthony Hopkins delivers his best and most emotional work in years, while Olivia Colman continues her impressive run. In fact, the entire cast his spot on. Complementing the performances is Peter Francis' previously mentioned Set Design, which adds to both the confusion and the explanation. Also elevating the film is the work of Film Editor Yorgos Lamprinos and the score from Ludovico Einaudi. Hopkins' character asks, ""Who exactly am I?"" and we feel the excruciating pain of realizing one's persona is slipping away. This will be a challenging film to watch for anyone who has experienced this type of agonizing loss in their life, and Zeller's film also serves as a warning to everyone else.

"2526","I understand the frustration of the ending. I was going to write off this movie as bad. Then I thought for a little bit.Here's my theory:
I believe Albert wasn't the killer. I know that's a common consensus. I don't think Deke or Jimmy was either. However, the confusion and frustration of not getting an answer from the film is actually the result expected. We, as an audience, are to feel just as lost and frustrated with the unknown and unresolved as Deke and Jimmy do. To feel just like how it is to be a obsessive Detective to the point where your perception has become so skewed from obsession, you're desperate for an answer. To the point where you break and it has consequences. Perhaps to show us how being a dedicated detective has its weight that finally breaks them down. Deke knows this finally, as Jimmy's situation wakes him up, however, he doesn't want Jimmy to become him. Thus buying the red clip to assure Jimmy that Albert was actually the killer, thus making him feel justified in killing him. While in reality, it wasn't Albert and it's another burden that Deke has to carry on with within his conscious.All in all, I believe the movie is to show the best of the best get a breaking point at some point, not wanting to admit defeat or that they just aren't as good as they used to be. Because all the sacrifices they give to dedicate their time into finding the killer or victims, they want it to be time that was well spent instead of time wasted making their life miserable.","7","FilmChamp20"," Watch before you read my review
"
"2527","""It's the little things that get you caught,"" Deke, played by Denzel Washington, tells Rami Malek's character Jimmy. ""It's the little things that rip you apart."" Unfortunately, I found that second sentiment particularly resonant as I watched ""The Little Things.""""The Little Things"" had a phenomenal trailer, very nuanced, well lit, choreographed, acted, and most importantly, well edited. Of course, the trailer was only two minutes long. How does the actual film, which is over two hours long, compare? Surely any movie that expands on the technical prowess and acting chops that the trailer set up will be fantastic! The movie does expand on all of the pieces the trailer introduced - in doing so, ""The Little Things"" takes one step forward, and two steps back. Admittedly, the movie looks good visually; the cinematography is appropriately moody, with dim lighting for the majority of the running time that casts an ominous shadow over its characters.The acting, too, is incredible. I've seen mixed reviews on Rami Malek's acting in this movie, but I thought he was great, if a little mumbly, which did make it hard to understand him (thank you subtitles). Denzel Washington is, as always, great. He puts on a quiet performance here that takes its time with viewers - you can tell there's something below this character that's waiting to bubble up. Denzel is a professional, and he acts like one; every word out of his mouth feels believable, every action he takes feels realistic for his character. Watching him and Malik collaborate to catch a killer is truly entertaining - Deke sucks Jimmy into his obsessive mindset, and it's interesting watching both of them fall deeper into the rabbit hole they've dug for themselves.Jared Leto as the might be, might not be killer is fascinating. Now granted, I may be biased because I like Jared Leto, but I thought he was pretty good in the role. His character was perfectly bizarre, always keeping Deke and Jimmy on their toes. Sure, Jared's character may act like a complete weirdo, but is he a killer? The movie keeps you, and its characters, guessing, which I appreciated. The story, which obviously focuses on these three characters, is elevated by the amazing performances. In a better film, I could see some serious Oscar contenders.Yes, I did say ""in a better film,"" because ""The Little Things"" does start to fall flat. Let's talk about the editing - did Olivier Megaton secretly direct this? Who decided on the editing style of this movie? There were a distracting amount of cuts in practically every single scene - for example, a scene where Denzel says goodbye to his dog before getting in his car has probably upwards of ten cuts. Similarly, a scene where Deke and Jimmy are eating breakfast has probably 20 cuts. There is rapid fire editing at play here, and I'm not sure the reason why. The film would've greatly benefited from a slow and steady editing style that allowed the camera to linger on its scenes and characters; instead, we get something akin to Paul Greengrass, which definitely doesn't fit the tone of the movie.Because of that, tonally, the movie is inconsistent. The pace feels all over the place, with the film only picking up when Jared Leto's character comes in the picture. Unfortunately, he starts to play a major role about an hour or more into the movie, which means you spend a majority of this film's length focusing on nothing really memorable. Additionally, the movie felt too short, even though it was over two hours long. There had to be scenes cut out of here, perhaps even scenes that further expanded as to why Deke and Jimmy were so obsessed over Jared Leto's character. It seems like they pick him as a suspect out of thin air; as you hear in the trailer, they find him suspicious because his car has high mileage. That's it? After Deke discovers this, they seem laser focused on nailing Leto's character, and I was wondering if I somehow missed another clue or piece of evidence that made Deke and Jimmy get so fixated.I did really enjoy the ending and overall message of the movie - this is definitely not a crowd-pleaser, and I commend the so different approach that the movie took. However, I really can't excuse the awful editing and the stagnant pace. In a better movie, the first hour would've been the first 30 minutes, with Leto's character being introduced early to build the tension and obsession of Jimmy and Deke. However, because ""The Little Things"" spends its first hour on nothing too significant, by the time Jared's character is finally introduced you'll wonder what the movie can possibly pull out of its hat to keep you interested now that it's almost over. ""The Little Things"" is a film with great performances and a really interesting premise that is brought way down by its editing, pacing, and tonal inconsistency. It's a perfectly watchable film, but with this cast, it should've been much better than it ends up being.","7","darkreignn"," Great cast and premise, brought down by bad editing

"2528","A movie can leave feeling any number of ways-happy, sad, amazed, provoked, whatever-but the common denominator of good ones is that when the lights go up, you feel satisfied; it was worth the trip. I didn't fee that way when this one ended. Yes, it made its point: a detective working a murder case can become obsessed; it's the burden of responsibility, seeking justice, retribution, vengeance-choose your word-for the victim. And the point of the story is the old proverb: ""Before you set out on a journey of revenge, dig two graves"" (or something like that). That's all well and good, but IMO, this story melted away in the last 30 minutes. With some hard work on the script and more inventiveness, it could have been so much more.","7","shorn-40895"," Satisfaction Is Not A LIttle Thing

"2529","There will never be another Se7en and, although this may appear similar, it is very different.Where as Se7en is all about the crime and the killer this is more concerned with the detectives hunting the killer.We meet Denzil as a lowly cop sent on an errand to the town that he used to be a respected detective in.It is clear something happened here that put a downward trajectory on his career.Almost by accident he gets pulled in to the hunt for a vicious serial killer.The crimes are not particularly clever of interesting or are the suspects.This is all about the detectives.This is well made and produced, the leads have a sickly pallor about them that reinforces the desperate state of the investigation.There is nothing particularly different about this movie and it is quite low on excitement.But the characters are engaging and I like watching Denzil in the detective roles where he gets to toy with people.As things ramp up near the end it feels like the writers are in a bit of a corner and the film takes a turn that is unexpected, yet still not very exciting.This sets up for a thought provoking ending.This is well made and I did enjoy it - I just wanted it to be more.Don't expect much action or thrills.","7","thekarmicnomad"," Still looking for another Se7en

"2530","SPOILERS AHEAD!!Like many others, I expected more from this movie considering the fabulous cast and the well-constructed trailer. This is one of those films that I truly wanted to LOVE.I'll list my PROS & CONS, to include the positives and negatives that I may have overlooked in a more general review.
CONS:Not very original storyline, too much copied from David Fincher's ""Sev7en"", or Denzel's ""Training Day"" (both of which included the ""retiring-cop-teaching-new-rookie-the-ropes"" theme). It was a challenge to convert my mindset to the PRE-smart phone technology of the early '90's, which made the instant communication factor non-existent. Of course that is no one's fault, just frustrating, lol. I guess if the story took place currently, it would have been a completely different plot.Too much jumpy editing from scene to scene.Too much focus on Sparma being the sole killer, not including any other tentative perps.Flashback overkill to inform the viewer how deeply Denzel's unsolved murders were haunting him. It seems they disrupted most scenes where he was alone. We get it, we get it, he's traumatized by his past of unsolved murders and his accidental killing of the female victim.Big plot hole with Jimmy trusting Sparma by turning his back on him while digging the holes. Actually, trusting Sparma enough to get into his car in the first place is not believable, especially with Jimmy believing Sparma was the killer. It was out of his character to make himself that vulnerable.On a technical note, I could not hear some of the dialogue no matter how high I added volume...like the characters were mumbling or speaking too fast. It must be a technical issue that was not intentional.Could have been 30 mins. shorter to tell the exact same story.
PROSStory was interesting enough to keep me guessing about Sparma's involvement in the murders.Denzel buying the red barrette for Jimmy (sneakily) to help him with closure and maybe lessen Jimmy's guilt. That was a clever and unique plot device, imho.Unlike other viewers, I don't feel that Jared Leto was overacting. His creepy character was convincing to me.I'll add more points to my review later if I think of any.","7","MagooWho"," Wanted To Like It More, But Enjoyed It Anyway!

The real question the movie poses is how far are you willing to go in order to catch a killer?","8","jamielewis-51864"," I think people are missing the point.

"2532","The Little Things - 7/10The little things obviously took a lot of inspiration from other films; everybody points out that it was inspired by David Fincher's Se7en but I was equally reminded of Nolan's Insomnia as well. That being said, that does not mean that this film doesn't have anything new to offer. Although it does follow some familiar tropes and storylines, it still is original enough to offer something new. Added to that is some fantastic acting from all three leads.Most of the time when you have multiple great actors all vying for an Oscar nomination in a single movie it leads to some dramatic overacting, in this case all three performances are subtle, subdued, understated yet still brilliant. The mystery in this film is fairly obvious, the trailer shows you everything you need to know. But with that in mind, the mystery wasn't really the focal point of this story in my opinion. The focus rather was on the characters and their development and about who they are as characters. In my mind the characters are written very well, not that they're perfect but they're good.I think there was some sloppy editing, sloppy writing, and inconsistent directing but nothing worthy of a 54% that they've received from Metacritic. I'm not saying it's the next big classic film or anything like that, no not at all. But I think that this film fully deserves a seven that I've given it. Not a classic, but definitely worth a watch if you enjoy dark films like seven, insomnia, and many more.","7","SimonsRants"," Better than people say, not as good as it could have been.

All cops who see this movie will appreciate the attempt to remain authentic to law enforcement.The story line was great with a wonderful who-done-it feel. Great dialogue and very well written. The element of being unforgivably connected to a murder that is from the past that is connected to the future that is connected to the past is as profound as it is plausible. Great work.Deke's hopes of salvation, in this life and the next, are tied to a young and cocky detective partner that comes to realize forgiveness can be hauntingly elusive.Watch this movie-it is as about as close as you're going to get to the frustrations and limitations of real police work.","8","ddamo-13945"," Great way to spend a pandemic Friday evening.

"2544","This is one of those cases of a film having a better trailer than the film actually is. Maybe it was just me but that trailer pulled me in and I was really looking forward to check this film out. Overriding feeling is disappointment because this film should have been better considering the great actors involved, interesting story and good directing.Denzel Washington is just doing what Denzel does best, thats not really a shocker to anyone alive. He is the rock/centre of the film and yeah he is good. What else am I meant to say ? However sadly for me this film has set it in stone that I really really don't like Rami Malek. I'm sorry he was the worst past of the film for me, I don't think it was all his fault , maybe he was miscast in this role. He is just so plain, dull and just has this one tone of arrogance/self confidence that doesn't always work. (I never thought he deserved his Oscar and ever since then he has done nothing thats impressed me........worried about No Time to Die now). On the flip side probably the one actor that will get the most hate, I actually think was brilliant and the best part of the film. Jared Leto. Yes is he over the top and yes he does get type cast now as playing the creepy guy......however I'd argue at least he is good at it. The film for me at that point was coasting and dull until he became a more prominent role, it got better from then on.The main problem I have with the film is the fact that there is no major investigative work done. Its just a few questions asked here and there, all of a sudden they jump on Leto's character. Which we all know isn't the killer in the end. I would have liked it if Washington and Malek joined up more and there was longer to flesh out there characters and relationship. Maybe just reveal Leto in the final act or right at the end or the true killer. I was expecting something more like Zodiac or the mini series True Detective ??Overall I'd give it a 65% out of 100 or a 6.5 out of 10. Its ok. I feel that Malek was majorly miscast in the film, needed someone with a bigger screen presence to go along with Washington. The story was interesting but told in a really loose and weird way that never really explained much. Plus at the end tried to answer every little detail of the few pieces of information we had, it didn't need to do that. Leto was the best part for me. Just disappointment because there is the ingredients for a really really great film here. Sadly this was made instead.","6","Lewis_Heather787"," Disappointing ! Its just ok

"2546","I watched this because of the actors. Do they not make good films anymore? Leto was good as the wackadoo he usually plays, but Denzel and Rami couldn't make an emotional connection if you killed their first borns. I felt nothing. Absolutely nothing. There was nothing to make me care about any of these characters, which is a shame because the opening scene is good. You can just shut the movie off after that cause there's no point. The movie is an hour too long. My husband fell asleep and managed to wake back up before anything ever actually happens - an hour in. The only reason I didn't fall asleep was because I napped earlier that day, otherwise this movie is a treatment for insomnia. I give up. I haven't seen a good movie since Impossible.

"2548","Yeah on paper the movie looks good .3 oscar winning actors and a good director but the translation to the screen it's just plain awful .The acting was below the standard of these actors . The only standout among the 3
was Denzel who gave a good performance but nothing special or challenging about his character which we have seen in dozen movies before . while the supporting cast were absolutely dreadful .Jared who played the weird and creepy repairman tried his best to be Kevin Spacey in 7 but failed miserabaly to the point when he became laughable but at least he made some effort and i give him the credit for that and oh boy here we come to the least convincing or i must say ( totally miscast) Rami Malek . he did no effort to bring his character to life . bland ; 0 emotion and 0 presence on the screen .Bring a 4th grade actor and he would have done a better job than he did or just get rid of his character and you will miss nothing .and for the script . well nothing original or creative about it . just take the best hints of some Fincher crafted thrillers ( Se7en- Zodiac - Mindhunter ) .Throw them into the mix with one of the most banal and frustrating endings to date . with characters doing illogical decisions to drive the plot forward and you will get what's all the movie about .
I must say that i enjoyed the captivating cinematography by John Schwartzman which brought the vibes of the 1990s and the score by Thomas Newman which was right on the target . but all of these elements went up in the smoke due to the lack of originality and cliched writing .
All in all . Despite the talented cast the movie had nothing new to add to this genre . if you expect a gritty crime thriller with captivating characters and masterful storytelling you will be disppointed .","3","DelaRed"," if Denzel wasn't the lead . it would go straight to cable Tv-movie .

"2549","Remi Malek looks like a sick Michelle Rodriguez, this guy's face is so... ""unique"" looking that it's hard to watch sometimes.Remi might be miscast, but he plays his character well. He has the perfect face for an up-all-night hacker ala Mr. Robot or a creepy weirdo killer/stalker, but it's kind of hard to take him seriously as a strait-laced up-and-coming detective.All right, putting Remi aside for one moment, Denzel does his usual thing and I enjoyed it, Jared Leto felt like Joker before the vat and I was okay with it for the character he was playing. The chemistry between Remi and Denzel was okay, nothing special.The attempt at a slow burn was good, I think it worked on some levels, but missed the mark at some point. It became really noticeable that the slow burn was losing me when I started to nod off at about the 1 hour 40 mark (also the point it dropped from 7 to 6). There are some editing issues that bugged me a little, but nothing too serious. Had I paid theatre prices I wouldn't be happy, but for staying at home this will do, I guess.Personally, I see this movie as a momentary blip, something that could've been great, only to be let down by some slightly off creative choices. The ending was not something I found to be profound either, I can see what the writer's attempting, but personally it fell flat. I won't recommend this movie to anyone, won't think about it after this review and I won't talk about it. A blip on the radar.I think any rating between 4 & 8 is justified and can be considered as coming from an objective reviewer, anything above or below is probably not free of bias.","6","Astropleb"," Almost a 7

"2550","I enjoyed this movie. From the start I was enthralled by Denzel's character, he is a flawed man and he is dealing with the consequences of his choices. Rami Malek is masterful as a ""by the book"" cop working a seemingly endless string of predatory murders. They team up and are forced to make the most difficult decision a public servant has to make. This movie questions the essence of justice and the law.","7","kev11142003"," Justice VS The Law
"
"2551","I am amazed at how much I can pay attention to the films I'm watching and pick up on the
details that make up the central theme. I'm not gonna pretend like I'm the most knowledgable,
but I am going to give my POV on what I think this movie is trying to say.I'll start with Deacon (Denzel Washington) who has a reputation in Los Angeles, recognized
noticably by Baxter (Rami Malek) who is a rookie detective. So the two of them begin
collaberating on a case involving murdered female victims by a sadistic man.In a bar, Baxter raises the question, and I'm paraphrasing, ""Why do cops obsess on a case
they are working on well beyond 5+ years while everyone else has moved on??"" Deacon
could've continued on the case longer, but the crimes stopped when the culprit moved
to another town. Outside his jurisdiction and into someone else's.One understanding is that you should never obsess over a case. Move on. The other side
of that is that if you obsess and play the sick games of the culprit, you might wind up
making a fatal mistake. Deacon accidentally kills a missing victim who startled him in the
woods, and Baxter kills Sparma (Jared Leto) who was annoying the heck out of him.
That is why it would be much easier to move on. I'm explain why that is in the confines
of this story in a bit.But yeah, move on and don't stoop to the level of a criminal to solve a crime. When dealing with
a sick man like Sparma, you move on or risk letting him get to you with his minds games, and you
make a fatal mistake.It's a tough pill to swallow.Moving on would've been easier in this story for one main reason. Sparma is a crime enthusiast. He meets Baxter and says he is a fan of his work. Basically, Sparma is the type of guy who would watch Law & Order, and take notes. The culprit in each episode is caught because of the details he or she missed that the police detectives catch on to. As Deacon puts it, ""The Little Things"".It's because of that reason that Sparma who basically mastered the act of covering up his tracks, so much so that connecting evidence to him is 100% impossible that he gets away with his crimes; and I do think
that Sparma is 100% the culprit for that reason.Evidence is conclusive. Sparma owning a CB radio means nothing. At one point, Baxter has forced Sparma
to take him to the body of a missing person's case. DOA. Supposedly buried out in the middle of nowhere.
Baxter has allowed himself to be sucked into Sparma's mind games. Which is why Baxter kills him with the shovel.Sparma is calm the whole time because since he is really good at paying attention to the Little Details in his crimes, he has no need for killing Baxter, and he knows Baxter is not going to find anything anyways, and tomorrow he's gonna go back to work. He even says that, as I paraphrase, ""Can we get this over with. I got work tomorrow.""Deacon who followed Sparma and Baxter to ""the scene of the crime"" sees what Baxter did and helps him cover it up while desposing of the evidence. Because of their built relationship, Deacon sees that Baxter will become like him in the future if he continues to obsess. Deacon knows that Baxter will be haunted by the innocent victims he let down. Just like Deacon in his own weird way.If I'm right, I don't think it was all for nothing, and I'm sure it'll show in the future anyways if the killings stop. I do think Sparma was the culprit, there was just no evidence tying him to the crimes.In the end, it is safe to assume that Baxter does move on. Again, this is just my baseline understanding. I do think some threads are thrown away, or not touched on much. Like the young girl in the prologue who reappears again much later and is just gone again soon after.If you pick up on those details if I'm on to something, you might be fascinated by this movie quitel like
I was.","8","avelrodriguez98"," Like the main characters, you should pay attention to the little things.

"2552","The opening scene is the only little thing about this movie that is actually worth while. Gripping and catching.

"2553","Generally, when a movie is ""dumped"" in January, it is a sure sign of a bad film, filled with Liam Neeson kicking butt or CGI monsters attacking a small group of survivors in an isolated location, but these being times that they are, Warner Brothers release of THE LITTLE THINGS simultaneously in Movie Theaters and on HBO MAX gave me reason to change my thinking.And...I'm glad I did for THE LITTLE THINGS is an intriguing mystery with 3 very strong actors going toe-to-toe with each other.Written and Directed by John Lee Hancock (THE BLIND SIDE), THE LITTLE THINGS stars the great Denzel Washington as a former L.A. Detective (now a Sherriff in some small town) who returns to L.A. and teams up with his hot shot replacement (Rami Malek) to track down a serial killer (the main suspect being Jared Leto).It is a moody, atmospheric piece with Hancock taking his time telling the story he wants to tell in the way he wants to tell it, letting this trio of Oscar winning actors take over the story while he creates interesting, moody pictures/scenarios/scenes.And...this approach mostly works. 2 time Oscar winner Denzel Washington, as you can imagine, is terrific as Joe ""Deke"" Deacon a cracker-jack Detective that is living with some demons from his last case in L.A.. He is in 90% of the scenes in this film and he is more than capable of carrying this film through some pretty slow and sloggy scenes.I would love to say that Oscar winner Rami Malek is equal to the task of playing against Washington and keeping the middle part of this film interesting - but he just isn't. Not to say that Malek is bad - he is very good. He just isn't as good as Washington and the chemistry between these two characters was just not all that strong.That said...without spoiling anything...Malek has a scene at the end of this film where he is TERRIFIC and shows that he is a VERY, VERY good actor.The wild card in this film is Oscar winner Jared Leto as the prime suspect in this case - and he is more than up to the task. As is often the case in these sorts of film (think David Fincher's SEVEN), Leto does not show up in full force until about 2/3 of the way through the film and that is too bad for he creates sparks on the screen the moment he enters the proceedings and the 3 way interrogation scene between these 3 Oscar winners is, I'm sure, what drew all 3 of these performers to this project and is the best thing in the film.The praise and the criticism of this film must fall on Writer/Director Hancock, for he was smart enough to cast these 3 actors and direct them well while also falling prey to falling in love too much with the script and atmosphere he created to the detriment of the film. He could have used someone telling him to speed things up.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)","7","bankofmarquis"," 3 strong actors elevate this above mediocrity

Denzel and Rami's characters are linked with crimes they have committed by the end of the movie, but who cares!

Denzel is involved with the case because of personal reason, one that has lasted 5 years, and the case has striking similarities to one of his cases. Rami Malek plays the new hot shot with the LAPD and partners up with Denzel to find the killer. Their prime suspect is played by Jared Leto who, quite honestly, steals the show.

It has so many parallels like the climax's are eerily similar.It does change Direction in its final act and does something to make it a little more memorable and individual.The acting is fine for the most part so edge slightly to the side of cartoon and feel a little out of place.The poster is gorgeous though, it really sticks in your head so there is a bonus.I don't know it wasn't really anything that I hadn't seen before.

"2569","I liked it. it was a nicely old fashioned detective story. Actually it had the touch of ""True Detective"" and would probably have made a great Season 4. It contains many elements of the famous TV show and I think giving us more time to look at the characters, to emphasize more on several plot elements would have done good to the story because thats where it mostly lacks a little bit.
The acting is superb. Now you've got 3 Oscar winning actors in the main roles, the expectations are high but I think absolutely flufilled.
Denzel Washington is fantastic in the leading role, its a typical Washington role but again he adds something really special to it. Especially in the scenes when he is facing is past. Great work.
Rami Malek got a lot of criticism for his performance, being too wooden, lacking emotionality, etc. I think thats exactly what his character is all about and that he absolutely captured it perfectly. I go even so far and say he gave the best performance in the film. His attitiude was unconventional but so was his character. Jared Leto was absolutely psycho and creepy. He did that well but needs to be careful to to get typecast in that kind of roles. But yeah he was really great.
The biggest issue lie in editing and direction in general . While the screenplay surely hd potential (also by John Lee Hancock) I think his direction really lacked. The score by Thomas Newman was good and so was the cinematography, actually one of the best elements. I was not a fan of the ending, I appreciate the conclusion of what the film tries to tell but still was a bit lazy at the end. Otherwise, good atmospheric crime thriller.","7","Alexander_Blanchett"," Would have made a great True Detective Season 4

"2580","While The Little Things may not be anything of much memoria, it still has a substantially good amount of worth as a piece of psychologically thrilling entertainment. The film shares much of its familiarity with the 1995 movie Se7en. Directed by John Lee Hancock, The Little Things follows two cops, Joe Deacon (Denzel Washington), a cop haunted by his past and cases he could not solve, and Jim Baxter (Rami Malek) as they investigate a chain of murders in 1990's Los Angeles and increasingly fixate their attention on Albert Sparma (Jared Leto) a suspect who seems to enjoy their attention. It's only by around the end of the first hour that Jared Leto's character Albert Sparma is brought into the picture. Throughout the runtime, the film insists that it's the little things that are important and conveys a theme that everybody has skeletons in their closet. The opening credits of the movie also introduces a new Warner Bros logo animation.The performances in the movie are nothing too memorable but are still good. With a cast led by notable Academy Award winners Denzel Washington, Rami Malek, and Jared Leto. The performances are supported by the script written by John Lee Hancock. The story of the movie is good and with turns at almost every corner it is another area in which the film has success. Although at its loss, the story leaves some areas of the film concealed from the audience. The Little Things will leave you at the edge of your seat in the film's most thrilling parts. The ending shifts from audience expectations and into a different structure than other films of the same genre and type.The score of the film composed by Thomas Newman is great and however does not assist in giving much of a thrilling aspect alongside the film's already existent thrill that is primarily occurrent in the opening and the ending. At the end of the movie, the score does assist with the thrill shown on screen. The lighting helps to set the ambiance of the film's 1990's Los Angeles setting with many dim and dark lights. These elements keep the tone fitting for the genre of a Drama, Crime, Thriller film.Overall, The story of the film explores many areas of the film and to its loss, leaves many areas of the film undisclosed. The score is great but does not give much in terms of a thrill. The performances in the film are also good, but they are nothing too special or memorable. These elements help to keep the thrilling storytelling and entertainment aspect of the movie at a somewhat large quality, there is nothing that is of amazing quality. I would rate this movie a 7.5/10. The Little Things is available to watch on HBO Max with a subscription from January 29th to February 28th and is also available to watch in theaters.","7","Loptimus06"," The Little Things Review

"2586","I kept seeing ads for this movie thinking that it was going to be a modern ""Se7en"", and this film also has a semi-all star cast of Oscar winning actors. Knowing these facts, I expected a pretty decent crime thriller.
During the movie, I felt that it was going nowhere. That was until Jared Leto's character appeared. When we are introduced to his character, the film began to pick up its pace. Rami malek, was not as his best by far, but Denzel was great as always. The editing was not great either as there weren't many scenes that felt rushed, as it did not give us time to really take in what was being presented to us.
John Lee Hancock has been known to make great historical films such as the blind side and the founder. I feel that this crime thriller was not his forte.
This was an enjoyable film however, just had multiple flaws and did not have much of an impact on me, like ""Se7en"".","6","ryantimmins"," Slow and suspenseful with unresolved details

"2587","If like me your a fan of the 90s mystery, detective thriller that requires no CGI or special effects or other modern day movie magic effects then The Little Things is for you.Its a shame that Hollywood appears to have has lost its faith in scripts like this one. The Little Things offers up a taste of the old school with its simple but effective plot that doesn't pretend to be anything that its not. The acting and dialogue is intelligent, subtle and effective. Denzel Washington, Rami Malek and Jared Leto all bring to the table a absorbing, masterful and truthful performances that really help bring a sense of long forgotten class to the movie.The sub-plot that explores the past events of Washington's character for me felt a little off but was well explained as it subtly drifts in and out of the movie as more and more is added leading to it tying nicely together with the main plot. I personally loved the 90's Jagged Edge style twist at the end that although isn't earth shattering its fun and commendable.The Little Things is a gripping and subtly tense movie that serves us commendable performances and a very well done simple but intelligent good guy vs bad guy plot.Solid Entertainment and here's me thinking they don't make them like that anymore but after watching The Little Things.....I'm glad to see they do!","9","chrisandmark-44838"," Brilliant - Old School Detective Movie

"2592","Academy Award Winners Denzel Washington, Jared Leto, and Remi Malek star in the new thriller ""The Little Things"" and combine to make very gripping and memorable performances.The script was reportedly written over thirty years ago by John Lee Hancock who has gone on to write, direct, and produce multiple films of note in the decades since he first created the screenplay.The film is set in 1990 and involves a cop named Joe Deacon (Denzel Washington), who travels from his small California town to Los Angeles to get information on a suspect.Joe has a history in L.A as he used to be a homicide detective for the department which combined with his meltdown while obsessing over a murder case has caused him more than a bit of notoriety.Jim Baxter (Remi Malek) is the hotshot new Detective who has been leading the investigation into a string of unsolved murders. Joe accompanies Jim to a new crime scene and notes some similarities with his unsolved case.Joe takes some personal days and begins to do some legwork on the case and reports his findings to Jim which causes Joe to remember aspects of what drove him to his marital, health, and career issues as he is unable and unwilling to let the case drop.When a prime suspect no longer fits into the picture; suspicions fall on a crime enthusiast named Albert (Jared Leto) who seems to check all the boxes but is also taking delight in winding up Joe which causes Jim to question if he is a viable suspect or just an oddball who gets off on crimes and winding up the cops but does not actually commit any offenses.As the delicate dance unfolds between the characters the fact that this is an era before Cell Phones, DNA tests, GPS, and elaborate computer networks helps underscore the plight of the officers. If the film was set in a modern setting much of the suspense and uncertainty of the story and characters would be moot thanks to technology.As the game of cat and mouse unfolds between the characters Jim learns how a person can become obsessed with a case and Joe attempts to mentor him from the success and failures of his life which includes some gray areas.Aside from the strong performances and engaging story what makes ""The Little Things"" work is that it is a film that does not take the Hollywood fallbacks of extended gunfights, car chases, and over the top action scenes. What it does show is real and flawed characters that are doing what they think is right and does not attempt to wrap things up in a nice and tidy package.The film uses the element of doubt to not only drive the story but to help motizate the actions of the characters and underscore the elements of uncertainty exists in some investigations.ambiguity also puts the focus on how investigations and procedures have evolved with the resources available to police.The film will appear in cinemas and HBO Max and is a compelling and well-crafted thriller that is not to be missed.4.5 stars out of 5","9","garethvk"," The Little Things Is A Star Powered Thriller Not To Be Missed

"2593","The Little Things is a classic Noir Murder Mystery set in 1990 Los Angeles. Deke, a small-town deputy previously banished from LA returns to his old beat to retrieve evidence needed for a small case in his new life. While waiting for evidence to clear, he becomes marginally involved in a case being handled by Jimmy Baxter, a series of killings eerily similar to the case that sent him packing years before. The unlikely pair manage to pool their talents to move the investigation forward and identify a suspect. As in all good mysteries, nothing, including the strongest suspect, is what it appears, and Little Things becomes a redemption story in a tale where none of the heroes are innocent.","8","megomike"," Classic Noir Mystery at Heart, with a Soul of Redemption

"2594","The writing is unbelievably bad. There is no pace to the story, and it's not even an attempt at suspense, it's just the writer not knowing how to develop a story.
No character depth or development. It gets worse as the movie goes on. You can not believe what you are watching is this bad because it has Denzel Washington in it!
The directing, dialogues, scenery are absolute trash and completely fail in the task of making you engage in what you are watching instead of thinking who funded this amateur project?
The acting is terrible as well, Rami Malek is not believable as a grown man, let alone a competent police detective. And Jared Leto!! do I need to say anything?

"2597","The movie was interesting and unlike other reviews, I thought the ending was great. Many reviews have said the ending did not work with the movie or the ending fell short. The problem was not the ending, but the rest of the movie. With a cast like Washington, Leto and Malik, the movie should have been a home run, and as far as acting goes, it was (though Malik was awkward at times). The story needed much more thrilling moments to be considered a ""psychological thriller"". The pacing and thrilling moments were just too slow. Leto was great as a suspected sociopath, however, the movie significantly underutilized him. I would have liked to see Leto taunting the police more often through his actions, more clues alluding to him being the killer, and the frustration continuing to mount with Washington and Malik from knowing they have caught the killer, yet can't do a thing about it. That would have made the ending so much more satisfying or understood when Malik's character finally ""lost it"" with Leto's character. Overall, I wouldn't call it a loss, but I don't think it's a movie I would watch again...Leto needs another opportunity to play a sadistic psychopath in the future because he played the character wonderfully. Denzel, was Denzel, always strong.","7","arod_85"," Good, but should have been great

"2600","I think the people who are giving this movie low ratings we're expecting some kind of a high octane crime thriller or a pulse pounding psycho killer flick. Instead, what we have is a slow burn psychological drama, character driven rather than plot driven.The movie is extremely well cast and acted, with an unexpectedly affecting score. In fact, the score is one of the films greatest strengths and is an excellent track in its own right, something that I will be seeking out on Spotify.I gather that a fair number of reviewers didn't like the ending, and I have to wonder if some of them just didn't get it or were, again, expecting some sort of action ending. That's just not the kind of movie this is. Highly recommended if you are a patient viewer, enjoy a lower key kind of suspense, and appreciate theme and character-centered movies.","7","ebeckstr-1"," Very solid suspense drama

"2601","I though the movie was really good. The music and sound editing were great. Someone picked apart the visual editing as having too many cuts-I didn't feel this way at all, and that sort of thing usually annoys me.Great acting by Denzel and Leto. I'm still not sold on Ramy... but I've only seen him in Mr Robot. Not sure I bought him as a detective. His demeanor is a little strange. But it didn't affect my opinion of the movie at all.The plot and ending, to me, was straight forward and good. Denzel's character was a great detective, he became obsessed with a case he couldn't solve, and it caused him to eff up. He happens upon a new case with same MO, and it's a chance to nail the killer. Ramy effs up too, Denzel helps him ""deal with it.""I think that the writers, editors, and director did their best to insinuate that Leto's character, was indeed the killer... even though there may never have been enough forensic evidence to hold up in court.The ending did leave me thinking... and after thinking about it, I was quite satisfied.","8","cenmail"," Really good; wouldn't call the ending ambiguous

"2602","Waited so long to finally see this movie. I tried not to go into it with high hopes but it's impossible not to be hopeful with a cast like this (except Leto)
Unfortunately I was not surprised by what I saw. Over acting on Leto's part, jarring cuts, an overly repetitive score, underdeveloped characters and a MAJOR plot hole. The movie feels like it's trying to say so many things but it never quite reaches the mark.
The only positives were Denzel's acting (as the case usually is), a few memorable lines, and the parts where it tries to do what every crime thriller before it has already done.
Overall the film serves better as something to put on in the background, not something that deserves your full undivided attention.So disappointing to be completely honest. Huge Denzel fan, pretty sure I've seen every movie he's been in at LEAST three times and this by far is probably the worst movie he's appeared in. I had so high hopes knowing Denzel, Remi, AND Jared was apart of it. Three PHENOMENAL actors with amazing potential but it was executed poorly in my opinion. Honestly, I feel like the storyline was there and it COULD'VE been a great movie! The first 27 minutes was really intriguing and drew me in, wondering what the next move was. Then there was a little over an hour of what just felt like stalling and expecting something to happen but it just never really does. One of the worst parts though to me though is there are so many things that you expect to come back up in the end, hoping that you'll find an answer or some type of closure of why it doesn't really make sense starting out.. to just find out only two of those things make sense. Also, the ending. I definitely grasped the meaning of why it was done.. just felt like it was kind cheap to end it.","8","nyxstrix"," Denzel Washington is the only actor we got, I reckon, who can get away with this stuff.

"2605","A good, characterful slow burn standard fare cop movie if you like character over action and don't expect a great twist at the end. Washington and Leto give solid, at times exceptional, performances and it is worth a watch just for those.The only weak link is the miscast of Rami Malek. His character seemed to be a pale imitation of Guy Pearce's character from LA Confidential in the beginning (without having the chops to pull it off) but his character quickly morphed into a sidekick-type to Denzel's much stronger lead and eventually a patsy to Leto's.
There wasn't a real character arch to show why he had the sudden change so it seems unnatural. His acting was cheesy and more caricature than character.I have enjoyed Malek in several productions but think he is much better as a creepy nerdy type, not a leading man. He completely ruined Bohemian Rhapsody for me with his limp performances and constant teeth sucking. I hope to see him cast more to his type in the future because honestly, much as I like him, I don't think he is a great actor but is effective as a creep. In this film his performance looked a little pathetic next to the great Denzel Washington and also Leto.","6","Opinate"," Tight little film with great acting but a miscast in Malek. Almost a 7.

That said the ending isn't really a satisfying ending. I'm glad I'm not the only one that thinks that.

Still, it was interesting and had some good variations. There may not be another ""Seven"" movie that comes along for who knows how long. Regarding the characters, Rami Malek has never been in my top 20, but he is riding high on his portrayal of Mercury. For me, in this film, the miscast was off-putting.","7","skp-43271"," Crime, drama, thriller . . .

"2613","I think if you have never seen the movie 7 then you will enjoy the ending a lot more. It's not that the ending of this movie is bad because it isn't and it's something I've never seen before and wasn't expecting. What I was expecting was a jaw dropping 7 esk type reveal and ending but we didnt get that. Then again if I wanted to see that shouldn't I just watch 7 again and if it had have ended like that it would most likely got slated for being a 7 copy.
I thougroughly enjoyed the movie right up to the ending which having thought about it is only disappointing because I'd built it up in my mind to be a 7 type movie ending which it wasn't and it wasn't the ending where Denzel arrives just in time to save his partner and it wasn't the ending where the baddie takes the cop by surprise and the gun goes off leaving you to wonder who's alive until the reveal but then they have all been done before and this is an ending I've never seen before but is it an ending I would have chosen given the choice? Well....No. Sometimes it's just nice to have another slice of cake, even though you know what it tastes like.The other problem with the movie is that it leaves you with a question about what the movie was actually about. Was it in fact a movie made in era of high tension with the police in the US about police corruption and the murder of an innocent man or was he and even if you decide upon that you are still left with the corruption issue.
The problem is that the main suspects guilt is ambiguous enough for you to question the motives and moral right or wrong of the cops. If this was a Dirty Harry movie you wouldn't even bat an eyelid at the ending, just cheer along as the cop who breaks the rules to get the bad guy gets it done again.
There are also numerous issues that spring up with the events of the ending. Getting in the car with the murder suspect and digging holes while he walks around you with you gun inches away from him?
A character that up to this point has been cool calm and collected breaks character after a single provedation and kills the suspect with a single swing of the shovel?
They then decide to commit a major felony with the possibility of getting caught when he simply says the suspect grabbed his gun and he swung the spade and hit him. There are no witnesses and all they need do is place the gun in his hand, after a brief investigation it's justifiable self defence and a lot easier to cover up than burying a body which could be found and taking the risk of cleaning an apartment and a car. The FBI are now carrying out an investigation in the area. It would also have fitted with the fact they covered up the earlier accidental killing.
So, the ending has issues and it's easy to see why people have been voting this lower than what you might expect.
It's not a 1 as some Muppets have been putting and it's not a 10 for most people. I think your expectations and past movie experience will determine how you rate the movie.
It does also lead to some interesting discussions about what the writer and director were aiming to bring to the screen. Is it a politically motivated agenda piece aimed at corruption in the police or is it a morally driven movie about the grey lines in life and what people are willing to live with.","7","benjaminlauriesmith"," I rated it 7 for a reason

"2614","Crazy! I liked it and I'm saddened by it. Great job by all of the cast. I'm blown by the creativity and by Denzel's character.

"2615","It's hard not to like a Denzel Washington movie. Especially a movie that has two Academy Award winners in it-say Rami Malek. This extra slow burn crime drama did nothing to enhance the image of Policemen. And what's more the crimes are never solved. Director John Lee Hancock's handling of this sad tale was commendable, but the script took the viewer on a road to nowhere. This tome was certainly not worth going to a theater and dropping $10-plus popcorn and drinks on. It was disappointing.

Had anyone else been cast for either role, I would've lost interest really quick. Malek was ok, but I feel someone else cast - DiCaprio, Gosling, or a Theo James, may have upped the ante as well as Washington and Leto did.Writer and director John Lee Hancock isn't exactly a seasoned filmmaker, but his directing was on point and his screenplay - although not entirely original, played out well. It wasn't Hollywood-ish or action packed, but instead, a more toned down timeline procedural format, and that was a refreshing change. Had it been a little faster paced and/or about 15-20 mins shaved off the 127 min runtime, I think the critics may have been a little less harsh. The cinematography and score were great, although the sound was off in a few scenes - mainly Malek's dialogue/low tonal voice.Nevertheless, I enjoyed it better than I expected.

"2630","This is a hard review to write because I can't say I liked this movie, but I don't think this movie was made to be liked, which is a testament to the effectiveness of the execution. It was well done, if unsatisfying, and plays on the anxiety and dizziness of ambiguity. It rides this anxiety into the credits, which may leave more than a few moviegoers feeling cheated of the tidy package they expected from a brooding crime drama.I went in knowing nothing except the cast, which is my preference, and was content to judge the film on against a blank slate of expectations. Denzel gave a subdued every-man performance with palpable sincerity. As Deacon, he commanded the screen in a quiet, repressed emotionality indicative of a seasoned actor. Malek was a suitable counterpart, mirroring a younger version of the weathered Deacon. The chemistry was ok between them, but the acting did feel flat and tedious at times, matching the doldrums of their stakeout and beat work. In terms of pacing, very little crime is on-screen. This is not the realm of heated car chases, shootouts or gut-wrenching murder scenes. Think CSI with added helpings of cafe dialogue and meaningful looks.Am I making It sound long and tiring? It is. Which wouldn't normally be how I'd describe a good movie, and yet this machine was built for a reason, and overall I think it does its job properly. It's built to make you question. Not just elementary whodunnit questions, but deep existential wrestling against the dark specter of the unknown-of uncertainty. After all, why are we drawn to mystery as a genre? Uncertainty is alluring and the thrill of the reveal brings a profound sense of satisfaction. The good guys triumph, the secret is made known, the disaster is averted. Here is where this film takes a sharp departure from the norm, and to its credit.As the plot rolled along, I felt the writers were stirring up more questions than the runtime would allow them to properly explore. We were handed two main characters, ostensibly noble, but internally conflicted. Driven by a sense of righteous duty, they relentlessly pursue the evil, even when it requires taking the law into their own hands (which, let's be real, pretty much every hero from Sherlock Holmes to James Bond does with shocking regularity). Their efforts should pay off. Their digging should unearth the truth. That's how reality should be. Neat, tidy, orderly and fair.And isn't that what we all want? The same as what these two obsessed detectives are risking their lives and sanity for: truth. Certainty. Closure. Is that so much to expect?It's a lot to expect, actually, and while you are right to expect star performances, unexpected turns, tense encounters and smoky interrogation room episodes, be careful about those expectations. We don't always get what we want. We don't always see the truth. The world doesn't always right itself of wrong.And so neither does this film. Nevertheless, it is a stirring commentary on how our obsession to know, to be right and to find closure can lead us into dark and dangerous territory where the odd serial killer may not be the greatest threat to our health and home.","8","josephbrewster-88279"," An unpleasant experience in (mostly) all the right ways

I really enjoyed the movie. Great acting and a good story if the confusion or vagueness left out. I had to rewind the movie to make sure of these points.
The ""nice boots"" mentioned then showed briefly on the bed of Deke implied he might be the killer but the beginning scene shows typical brown leather shoes worn by the serial killer. The first scene also shows a non-black man's wrist confirming it was not Deke. More could have been done to really wrap up the movie to make this a 8 or 9 out of 10 movie.

"2636","Very interesting movie. For such a star studded cast, we are actually given a fairly straightforward who-dun-it. In the end though, we find more than we bargained for and it's not what you think it is.I think acting was good but I do feel that editing could be better. There could be some more back story to certain elements. The ex wife scenes were fairly useless.Ending was good but unexpected, which is what I like. I do think that Denzel did the right thing for this time, but is it really the right thing for all times?If we're to go a bit of philosophical here, then I would disagree, no one gets to be judge, jury and executioner, no matter how confident one is.If that's not a cautionary tale of this movie, nothing else is.7.5/10. I think with better editing, it could be 8.5 movie.","8","iconians"," Who says there is a happy ending...

"2637","""The Little Things"" is almost exactly the story line of John Shea's "" Grey Lady"" for the first hour until it morphs into "" The Pledge"", the underrated Nicholson film directed by Sean Penn.
What lifts this film above "" Grey Lady"" is Denzel Washington understands his character,while Eric Dane as the lead cop in a similar circumstance in ""Grey Lady"", clearly did not.
Is "" The Little Things"" a great film? Almost. Its an adult film which reinforces life is messy and happy outcomes are often quite subjective. Its a smart film. "" Grey Lady"" was not. I watched this and thought, "" John Shea could have been the lead in this"" . As he should have been in "" Grey Lady"". Little things matter. So do the big ones. Which is why "" The Little Things"" is better.","7","caggianogabe"," John Shea's "" Grey Lady"" set in LA

REVIEW:The new age means new approaches to the cinema world and this movie took that liberty to stray from the usual action packed, crime buster that USA has made famous. The Little Things is all about portraying the criminal investigation process, the stress that goes with it, and the effects it has on certain people in their responses to hunting down the perpetrator. Those who like the realism in their cinema coffee blend are going to appreciate the lack of flashy sequences and gun play, favoring the gradual revelation of clues and the grey area that solving crimes sometimes takes to get the man, including invasion of freedoms. Amidst the crime comes a fantastic portrayal of two detectives' approaches to the case, mixing histories, honor, personalities and many other quirks that further muddy the waters of justice and personal revenge. Washington and Malek each have different backgrounds and you can potentially resonate with either one as they try to control their darker qualities and prevent it from going too far in their hunt. This different beast again adds an unseen antagonist in the mix and helps with part of the mystery element this film dangles in front of you in the trailers. A setting that helps further bring the crime thriller out further, dark filters, shady lighting, seedy parts of the neighborhoods, and a wilderness capable of hiding anything, the directors of setting get props from me in how they have created a very deadly, yet normal setting to amp the mystery.
The film continues to impress me in how much they have integrated the departments to finding the solution to the cases presented to them. Forensics, body dissection, district attorneys, potential witnesses, interrogation, and more are all a part of the pieces to help you dive further into the process, while also opening up more avenues of backstory to help shed some light on our protagonists. What's even cooler is seeing how these elements change as the big change in direction of the film occurs, going from trying to track down suspects to then trying to prove their suspect is the one who did the crime. Seeing how each of the departments changes their focus and brings new angles to try to change things up. While this may not seem too original, the movie gets points for breaking away from the USA crime movie syndrome, and really starts to show the more original flavor as the movie gets to the ending. At this point, the movie takes a final direction that will impress some and tick off others as what seems like a linear approaches suddenly twists and turns until the very last second.
Everything that brings it together though is the acting... no surprise right? Denzel ever the ""charismatic"" actor brings his cool edge to this thriller and the complexity the movie takes. Though still a bit one dimensional as many of his roles have become, the quiet, focused, and obsessive cop attitude still works extremely well to make the sword to cut through the darkness. His stoic and rash behaviors mix to get the case moving, and the usual loose cannon attitude means interesting dynamics with the rest of the cast on this case and the potential for an alluring backstory. Malek is of course a bag of tricks himself, a multi layered characters that starts out so one color, but quickly bleeds into others as his own inner flaws begin to leak out and manipulated. The two together are a solid pair with the writing, playing off of each other's personalities and helping bring the intensity of the case to full bear. As for Leto... well he pulls that Joker like insanity out, but manages to tweak it to levels that again stay realistic and less comical. His tone, smile, even the subtle movements are all delivered to the right mixture to give you the creeps, and still keep you guessing in the long run.Yet with the pages of good I have written, there are some limitations I have noticed others point out. For one thing, the victim edge is sort of diluted in this film, originally brought out as the heart of the tale, and then sort of brushed to the side. Serial killer films require that edge of who is the next one to be taken out by the deranged fool. Sadly, the little things spent little time on keeping that edge, and taking the victim part of the crime out meaning I missed that element. Minor in the long run, the danger sort of transpired to a new, more symbolic means and it really started to feel less impactful as the final act came around. Something that stayed through much of the film was an odd scene jump and transition at times especially at the beginning when the story was trying to find its stride. Random jumps between leads, going to random shots of the house, or a random lead to dig up a case, and constantly shifting to random areas of the case were a bit hard to follow and enjoy when they interrupted the momentum of the scene. Though more realistic, that interruption happened too frequently and felt that the time could have been better spent on some of the other limitations for me, such as characters and back story. Primarily for Denzel's character, his story offers a lot of complex pieces and information that although has fair representation could have been seen more in the struggles he had with the case. One backstory did this quite well and building upon the mystery, but others like his love life and health, could have taken a bit more time to develop. Even more so the use of other characters needed some more tweaking for me as well. The female cop with an edge, the one girl they spent 10 minutes introducing at the beginning, the detective and the forensic scientist... all had enough hints dropped to have deeper involvement, but sort of tapered out as the final act happened. I'm all about trying to make sure to select characters and use them well, and though not the worst I've seen, again there was so much they could have done to help fluff up their roles a little more.
The biggest things for me that I was not the biggest fan of were the lack of mystery at certain points and the ending. First off, the movie's first act is supposed to be about finding the potential killer and starts of keeping the identity a secret. That's great... except for the fact that the trailer kind of ruins it and thus takes that element away, which again is part of the magic of these films and a limitation to the Internet these days. Missing that component, the first act fortunately has other factors to keep you going, but that edge is a little more blunted as the result. Yet it's the ending that really pulls the rug out from under my feet, primarily the last twenty minutes or so. I'm all about making sure to close the loops and have a solid conclusion with only enough unknown to go back and talk about, but this film decided to leave more unknown and go the symbolic growth route instead. While powerful, the whole buildup of the second act was about determining the truth, which after many scenes and each party trying to outdo the other to find the truth I won't lie I was disappointed. Maybe it would not have met expectations, maybe the director was going for originality/realism a little more, or maybe it's the modern symbolic conclusion and let the audience decide. Regardless, the ending is there to let you discuss, but after all the disruptions that it brought, I was not a fan of the finale.The VERDICT:A great film in comparison to the last two hbomax originals, The Little Things really feels like a trip back to the theaters for me. A great acting cast brings out engaging characters who play the parts quite well in this game of crime. The complex characters with multiple layers that show off the complicated job of solving mysteries and bringing justice. With some camera angle supports, a realistic flavor, and some originality into the mix, this movie manages to stand out amidst several of the crime films I've seen recently. However, that very twist and approach to realism may have been the undoing at parts too, and with a semi-ambiguous ending that fulfills on some levels and fails on others, it's going to leave some scratching their head at if they enjoyed it. Still, limitations aside, this would be a movie worth watching for me and encourage you to give it a shot if you have the subscription for it.My scores are:Crime/Drama/Thriller: 7.5

The plot felt very 'Se7enish', but to me more in a tribute kind of way.THE ONLY THING I COULD NOT WRAP MY HEAD AROUND was the godafwul editing. Especially the first scenes where we meet Washington and Malek. What the f* was that? The breakfast scene was filmed from every possible angle that lasted less than a second.. It was so confusing I had to pause the movie multiple times.

The chase in the opening scene was with a blue car, but not Deke's Ford. Albert has a green and a yellow car. Plus, the guy at the beginning looked nothing like any of them.For me, this movie is to show how hard detectives' work is, and how emotional they can become pursuing the culprit.

"2646","The recent thriller w/a trifecta of Oscar winning actors; Denzel Washington, Rami Malek & Jared Leto. Washington was a big LA detective but after a deadly mishap during a multiple murder investigation he was cached to a Northern California town to eke out his days as a deputy. In a chance coincidence, he returns back to his stomping grounds (on an errand to pick up a piece of evidence for an unrelated case) where he's gets a full view of a press conference being run by Malek, in the spot he once held, detailing a new killing (w/similar circumstances to his own unsolved). At first derisive to the way his older partners show deference to Washington, Malek brings him in to consult w/Washington none to happy to go back to dot his 'I's & cross his 'T's as it were. Leto becomes the focus of the investigation (the murder victim had an appointment for a fridge repairman which Leto being one in the area) since the clues start to point towards him hard. Leto however seems to be straddling the fence as to whether he's the doer or just a guy who likes to mess w/the police which puts an ever increasing tightening vice on capturing the killer (a missing woman adds to the pressure). According to something I saw on the Double Toasted video review for this movie (one person in the chat room said the script was written in the late 90's) this film feels retro (films like this aren't really made anymore) which makes sense since the movie Seven (released in 1995) was the pinnacle of this type of thriller, you'd figure every studio beat the bushes to find their own version of the same success. Falling into the dark European thrillers which have become the rage in the last few years (The Girl w/the Dragon Tattoo trilogy & the misbegotten The Snowman is another), this film works in the low key register it finds itself w/an ambiguous ending which doesn't tie everything into a neat bow. Kudos to writer/director John Lee Hancock (who wrote A Perfect World for Clint Eastwood back in '93) who knows he's mining for small nuggets of goodness rather than a mother lode. Co-starring Chris Bauer (from The Wire), Natalie Morales, Terry Kinney (who worked w/Washington in The Devil in a Blue Dress) all as fellow detectives w/Glenn Morshower as Washington's boss & Frederick Koehler (who I remember as the son on Kate & Allie) as an initial suspect for the crimes.","7","masonfisk"," THE WAGES OF SIN...!

Yet, the unrewarded painful evidence combing & stakeouts lead & expose mysteries that all characters share....except Maleks. He seems disjointed & more concerned with personal life.

"2650","It's been a while since audiences have been treated to a classic, procedural crime thriller, and 'The Little Things' has filled that void for those of us who have access to HBO Max.If it feels like we've seen this film before, it's because we have, thanks to a very basic plot and linear story flow. The ""washed up old cop teams up with aggressive young detective"" plotline has been done to death, but it still makes for an interesting watch if the caliber of the actors is high. Fortunately, Denzel Washington and Rami Malek fit that bill well as academy award winning-actors, and while the source material isn't stellar, they both do a respectable job here. Speaking of academy award winners, Jared Leto once again dials up the creep factor as an appliance maintenance guy, so there's that.'Little' is dark, heavy and unsettling at times, and while not an uplifting film by any means, it also has some important takeaways and explores interesting themes including the role of fatherhood and confronting the past. It also serves its intended purpose as a thriller - there are enough twists and turns to make it into a wild ride around LA circa 1990.It won't be remembered as a career highlight for any of its top-billed cast, but 'The Little Things' is worth the time if this is one of your favorite genres.","6","Mike_Devine"," A quintessential throwback crime thriller

"2662","The Map of Tiny Perfect Things is a fun film with amazing stunts, a heart-warming teenage love story, a time loop and even a really cool 4-D cube drawing! The idea in this story of having infinite do-overs to create the perfect day is fascinating. Putting it all together, this film is a great combination of action, light romance, adventure, and comedy.The Map of Tiny Perfect Things features Mark (Kyle Allen) who gets stuck in a time loop and is living the same day over and over again. Every night at midnight, he falls asleep and wakes up with the previous day starting over again. In the mist of the time loop, one day he meets a mysterious girl named Margaret (Kathryn Newton) who is stuck in the same time loop. They end up on an adventure all around the city finding the ""tiny things"" that make up that one perfect day, while trying to decide if and how to break the time loop.I enjoyed watching Mark and Margaret's friendship develop and all the wild things they do without suffering consequences since they are in the time loop, like drive a tractor down the street. My favorite part is when they completely trash a model home, knowing the time loop would put it back the way it was. Another part I love is when Mark shows his dad the tattoo he got. It's funny because he shows it to his dad right before he goes back into the time loop so his dad won't remember. The Map of Tiny Perfect Things has some really great stunts in it, too. One stunt I thought was cool was when Mark throws his water bottle at a closing door and makes it through!The message of this film is that sometimes the most perfect things in life may be the smallest things. One great lesson Mark's character shows is how to care about others. I loved seeing him remember all the ways he can help people in his town each day and spread kindness. A couple of things adults should look out for in this film include places with Margaret drinking and mild cursing.
I rate The Map of Tiny Perfect Things 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 years old. Adults will like it, too.Reviewed by Tiana S., KIDS FIRST!","8","rannynm"," Heart-warming teenage love story, a time loop with repeated do-overs

The journey these two end up going on together to reach where they need to go in themselves and with one another has a deeper dimension then it seems. If you surf the surface, you'll miss it. I dub movies like this ""hospice"" films because facing death is an underlying theme. So yes, it's also a teenage rom/com, coming of age; it's also an homage to the now classic Groundhog Day. We don't think about what teenagers deal with -- the serious issues families are challenged by -- this film lets us take a pause to consider that and look for the many tiny perfect things that show up in a day. It's bright and fun, sweet and dear, innocent and thoughtful, sobering and reconciling.","9","lightheartedbeing"," Perfect little Film finding the many tine perfect things

"2664","The movie is pretty average across the board. It uses a extremely over done thing in film and does it passingly.It isn't some cringefest teen drama which i expected it to be. It wants to be more than that. I don't know if this is a good or bad thing because it was really pseudo intellectual. It really thought it was cracking new ground or wanted its teen viewers to feel like ""wow iv just had my eyes opened'.I think that Palm Springs (2020) did this in a much better way all around. It has the same sort of ideas under everything but Palm Springs delivers it in a more charming, funny and subtler way than this movie. This movie what's to bash you over the head with its ideas and beg you to believe that it may be the most eye opening thing that has ever grace the face of the earth.Like i said i think this is better than it being a throw away teen romcom i just think it should have subdued its message. People would have got it without it shoving it in your face.The acting was fine and so was the writing. I think the writing showed the teen part of the movie the most.

"2665","As a cinephile, most pictures such as these are too formulaic and way too overdone (at this point) for me. Not to mention that almost each one involves some sort of superhero or villain nowadays, and although I very much enjoy that genre also, I can't tell you enough how pleased I was to find the treasure which is The Map of Tiny Perfect Things. To find, and share with you, that it does so much more, and more powerfully, than what bigger, flashier films try, with such a small footprint, is been beyond delightful.Kyle Allen steals the show as Mark. His easy chemistry with the screen is magic. Kathryn Newton is a little less fluid in her role as Margaret, especially at the beginning. The small, seldom-seen, supporting cast is tremendous.As for the tiny perfect things, some indeed are tiny, or perhaps not on the level you or I would consider to be perfect. In fact, a better definition might be: things that makes us smile and think. In any case, the film uses them effectively in that they do indeed bring a smile, and we think; and in fact, we may miss some if we blink. More so, however, they are effective in that we cannot help, at least for a brief time after watching the film, to look for our own.In closing, this is a rich, yet simple film with deeper undercurrents of love and loss, yes, but more so, beyond being tender and uplifting, it is generous in its message that there are miracles around us every single day, if we just look a little.","9","Her-Excellency"," Perfect Simple Little Huge Film

It explores one repeating day through the eyes of a young man and draws you into his world. That day continues to repeat itself until suddenly he meets a girl who is having the same repeated day. They hang together and see that day in a new way. Perfect tableau's appearing in front of them for moments through that day. You see these moments just as they see them. Tiny, perfect things.

"2669","I'm getting so sick of the whole day-keeps-repeating-over-and-over plot line. No movies that I know of have really done anything new with the concept, but they at least manage some sense of charm and intrigue. Unfortunately, the painfully generic Map of Tiny Perfect Things flounders in that department.The story is pretty much exactly what you'd expect. It's so predictable, that it's entirely unnecessary to put it in this review. Just read the basic premise and title, and you've already got a pretty good idea as to where it's going.Now, that on its own wouldn't be a problem. The similarly predictable Palm Springs managed to be incredibly enjoyable, thanks to great performances, some funny lines, and solid writing. The Map of Tiny Perfect Things is just... meh in every department. The performances are serviceable, but they aren't exceptional. The writing does okay, but there's really nothing memorable. And there is but one funny line in the entire movie, which inexplicably is said in the middle of what I assume was supposed to be an emotional scene.Additionally, the whole film has an aggressive Indie vibe, as if every frame is screaming ""WE WEREN'T MADE BY A BIG MOVIE STUDIO."" This is especially strange, considering that it was made by Amazon, one of the largest companies in the world. Because of this, the whole film has this underlying sense of corporate control that was almost a little eerie. For example, it feels like the love interest has a sad backstory not so that the audience can empathize with her, but rather because the studio heads say it'll make people cry. Honestly, this strange tone persisted throughout the movie, and I was more than a little uncomfortable with it.Overall, the Map of Tiny Perfect Things is harmless and doesn't really have anything horrible in it. Items just so cookie-cutter and bland, taking an overdone premise and doing nothing new with it. I suppose it will make for a serviceable movie-watching experience, but frankly there are much better time travel movies out there (Safety Not Guaranteed on Netflix, Palm Springs on Hulu, and Donnie Darko come to mind). The Map of Tiny Perfect Things isn't a horrible way to spend 90 minutes, but I'm sure most people will have much better things to do with their time.Final Score: 57/100.","5","Lockout_Salties"," Harmless, but also thoughtless

"2670","This movie is smart enough to have the characters live in the same world and actually seen the same movies as the audience. So when the young teenager Mark is reliving the same day over and over again, he comments ""this is just like Groundhog's Day."" And when Mark describes his temporal abnormality to his video game addicted friend, the friend replies ""Oh, you mean just like Edge of Tomorrow"".Mark eventually encounters a teenage girl who shares the same temporal abnormality as him. And together they begin to discover and catalogue all the 'perfect little things' that happen repetitively every day in their small town. And predictably, Mark begins to fall in love with the only person who shares his life and experiences. Then there is an interesting plot twist played on both Mark and the audience near the end of the film.This is an entertaining take on a well-worn theme and the two young actors do a great job.","9","gtmarcyk"," Self aware rom-com

"2673","Yes, we have seen this premise for a movie before, but it knows that. The movie knows that it's not groundbreaking stuff. It doesn't try to be something original, but it just tries to be a fun and loveable movie. The first half of the movie is just what it needs to be. It doesn't try to hide the fact that it's a time loop movie. It just has fun with the idea of being stuck in the same day. Then after some fun moments with the protagonist we meet the other character who is stuck in the loop. After that the movie just becomes very loveable. From the moment they meet I couldn't help but smile. The main actors are so good together. Their acting is also fantastic. My main problem with the movie start around the second act. What makes the movie strong is that it doesn't try to be complicated in the first half. It just shows that a story that we know can still be fun. That's exactly why I didn't like the second half as much. It tries to be more that it is and overcomplicated things. I also didn't like the storyline of everything revolves around us. At the end it just leaves me a bit disappointed after that great first half. Still a very sweet Rom-Com with amazing acting performances.","6","joostkale"," A familiar story put in a lovable jacket

This was done in such a way that it wasn't repetitive like Happy Death Day and Palm Springs were. I didn't feel stuck in a time loop viewing it.It's an uplifting movie about appreciating the small things around you that you would usually miss out on by just having a busy life. When stuck in a time loop, the characters start to notice tiny perfect things around them in the world.

"2695","You know what is an absolutely fantastic film? Groundhog Day. Funny, intelligent, thought-provoking, real feeling characters, and a well made plot line.All things missing from this film.You see, there's a ""time loop"", and our protagonists are stuck in it. It's a fine pretense, but it's mostly done in a very dull / ""been there done that"" sort of way, like even the characters themselves are mostly unimpressed by the situation they are in.(Hollywood side note: As I'm sure it's not lost on some people, this film shares shocking similarities to a film that came out just about a year before this one, ""Palm Springs"", that also has a ""devil may care"" lead woman character and joins the action midstream. Like Dante's Peak and Volcano coming out the same year, or Deep Impact and Armageddon, apparently the same ""repeating day"" script was floating around Hollywood at the same time.)Much like last year's ""Palm Springs"", no attempt is made to cash in on the instant comedy and drama that would be built into someone discovering their day is repeating as it happened, instead we join the action midstream, like you get the idea they've been doing this already hundreds of times, or more. It helps catch you up on the story quickly, but it's lazy, and the characters seem mostly unphased by it all.What's even more lazy is when you find out the ""cause"" of the repetition. I won't go into all of it here, but It makes zero sense in an already nonsensical plot, like, is the lead actress just a god or something? Oh wait, it's because she's ""good at math"". Okay?Anyway, the entire plot is actually just an excuse for a very corny, teeniebopper cringe romance.I love the concept of time loop films, but this one was just absolutely the path of least resistance, as if whoever wrote it couldn't be bothered it make sense of it all, so they just don't.

(just nice).It isn't bad, it certainly isn't original, is full of the typical teen clichés and desperately wants to be more than it is whilst trying to be quaint - an Amazon movie production that wants to be a small indie film.And that's a bit of a problem. It tries soo hard to be original - even when it spends the whole movie commenting on similar movies. The acting is really ropey (sorry) which gets even more cringey when combined with the some (most) of the cheesy narrative.Plot holes are also an issue. The movie 'tries' to be intellectual but as the movie and characters develop the story starts to play fast and loose on the concept of time in order to focus on the relationship between the two lead characters.If you can get past all of this then you'll probably enjoy it, but you certainly wouldn't want to watch it on repeat ;-)","6","matt_hew"," The Film of Tiny Plot Holes & Perfect Clichés (6/10)

"2706","Grounhog day, Edge of tomorrow, Palm Springs, Boss level, The map of tiny perfect things.
The common theme is being stuk in a rut. The plot is centered around overcoming tedium, disappointment in one's self, confronting some form of crisis that stops the protagonist dead in his or her tracks. It's the most basic recipe of a bildungsroman. The protagonist is forced to relive the same day untill he or she gets ""it"" right. Untill he or she find that wich he or she (respectively) is lacking, but desperately needs to move on and have a life. Sometimes ""it"" is something heroic, extraordinary, other times mundane. But always, and I mean always ""it"" involves a reinvention of one's self. Doing away with the old and letting something new arise. It's a lengthy, and oftentimes a painful process.
The reason I needed to expand on this is because this theme, which is quickly becoming a genre, is a basic form of telling a story about personal growth. It's as old as mankind. Recently, it is also being overused.
Midlife crisis solved by personal connection, cowardice overcome by a sense of caring and taking on responsibility, jadedness supplanted by love, escaping cynicism by shouldering the weight of the world, respectively. Now, finally we get emotional pain eased by meaningful connection, dare I say love.
I get it, it's true. It's a heartwarming tale, it's also lazy. Not on the part of the creators of this movie or any of the aformentioned, because these movies are good, rather on the part of the industry itself. Also due to the current references, this movie won't age well.
Watch this movie, you'll like it I'm sure. And don't forget: meaningful personal connections and personal responsibility before anything else, lest we have a dozen more of these movies. Let's let the movie industry work for it's money; in the meantime if you need a reminder, just open the Bible, read buddhist texts or really any classic of western literature; or just watch these movies on a loop.","10","urbanswami"," In a loop

"2724","A recent Amazon Prime release starring Kyle Allen & Kathryn Newton (from Freaky) which borrows heavily from Groundhog's Day & Edge of Tomorrow (which both get name-checked here by our hero). We have Allen (soon to be seen in Spielberg's West Side Story remake) wakes up to a normal day on the surface but as he inexplicably walks through town anticipating events as if he were a seer (he continually saves a girl from being hit by a beach ball at the town's pool) but when he notices Newton (someone who up to this point has never run into), his interest is peaked. Following Newton forces him to broker a conversation w/her which blossoms into a tentative romance, even though at a certain time every day she needs to be somewhere leaving Allen scratching his head but when he finally finds out Newton's secret (a family member is about to pass from cancer), all the pieces fall into place. If it weren't for Groundhog's Day, the granddaddy of all these type of films (Happy Death Day & it's sequel count as well), this version would be revolutionary, novel even but since its basking in the sun of its large shouldered predecessor, this gets a pass, more for the winsome, likeable leads then for the story itself.

"2737","For a rom com with modest ambitions, I found it extremely enjoyable. One reviewer criticized the characters as lacking in flaws, but that made it feel more real to me. The characters have flaws, but most real life young adults are pretty good people and aren't boiling over with so much drama that they end up yelling at each other before kissing each other in a thunderstorm. I think it had more emotional depth for the lack of heightened drama, not less, and is challenging cinema norms in a very needed way. Not all of film needs to be soap opera and Shakespearian theater. There is a place for grounded portrayal of ordinary people, because in the end real life is bigger than our imaginations. When Hollywood is drowning us in fake or cheap drama, this has the potential to be revolutionary. I hope it has influence.","9","jmn-83551"," Acting so modest and grounded that it becomes innovative, and deeply enjoyable.

"2740","Who gets a haircut and their scalp is perfectly tanned? Who gets $100 bills out of ATM's? How can someone in a constant time-loop not figure out what someone wants when nothing else works? Also, if one has been in a time-loop a thousand or more times, knows almost every little thing that will happen, how difficult is it to find a dog? It's the little things that stick out to people in time-loop films.The cliché of doing a topic over and over again is us inevitably in a time-loop. What I think makes a great love story to watch is the one viewing it becomes enamored with one or both of the characters who is in the love story. Mark (Kyle Allen) is the one we start off with. We see through his daily routine that he's been in the loop for quite awhile, so in essence: we learn nothing about him except he has a father in his life, a mother that works, apparently, a lot, a younger sister who's on the soccer team, and a best friend who he talks to but...they're all inconsequential to each other because we're stuck watching his carefree life. There's no tribulation. Then enters Margaret (Kathryn Newton) who, apparently, may have been in the time-loop just as long as Mark but that's the impression and she still seems to have her wits about her, even if she acts a little too carefree, and how they only just ran into each other in a seemingly small town where they go to the same school, per sé?50 minutes in I was expecting something, anything, and the build up is there but nothing. I didn't care about the characters because one doesn't really learn anything about them to care anything about them. What kind of people are they? What's the emotional pull for us to them? None of this is shown until the last 20-30 minutes and by then...who cares? Time is a human invention. It can mean something. Everything important in this film is in the last 25 minutes; we were only seeing his life and not hers. One may attach themselves to him by the end but the character of Margaret just seemed like fodder up to that point, and that doesn't make a love story whether Margaret's love for Mark or for her mother. We should have gotten more of Margaret's story except in the last 15-20 minutes. But then that was the entire point of the film.Did it work?","7","nammage"," Time-Loop Love Story

"2741","The Map of Tiny Perfect Things is about a genius girl who not only knows how to draw the fourth dimension but also how to manipulate it. Yet the movie follows a different teenager, a nerdy boy who likes to draw more-literal pictures and who never comes to realize that he's also being manipulated. The time loop genre is old and abused enough now but this movie is fun, bold and thoughtful. The two young actors confirm to have a great talent. The Map of Tiny Perfect Things finds the fresh in the familiar.

"2750","Okay so just because I didn't like it doesn't mean you Wont.If you are looking for something sweet and heartwarming watch this. But if you are looking for something actually different do not watch. In my opinion this movie is nothing special. They are trying way to hard to make the girl character "" quirky"" and "" unique"" she's nice but she's the definition of the kind of girl producers try to make when they try to make that one girl look "" quirky and different"" The storyline is basic and nothing new. I understand the message is super sweet and inspirational, to find the perfect things in my life. But in my opinion they chose the wrong characters for this. My idea of what the concept in that topic should be is to find the unexpected even in the expected. And the fact is you could pull a guy and a girl like him from any basic highschool and force them to see the "" beautiful in life"" and they would all act the same. Plus the romance is basically forced because the guy really wanted to meet someone and he could have met any girl who was cute or "" quirky"" and been like I like you. And that's not unique or different at all. Because without the loop it would have just been like those basic highschool movies where the "" different girl"" meets the nice but hot guy. The only slightly unique thing is the idea of trying to find the perfect things in life but it's delivered in such a basic way with a basic cast.

There have been so many of stuck-in-a-day time loop movie, almost one every year. And I have watched many of them. But this is so far the sweetest one for me. It is more than just a time loop story, but also a story of 2 teenagers trying to find the meaning of lives, discovering themselves, trying to do good the people around them, and also, most importantly, to fall in love with each other. Beyond that, it is also a ""day"" for them to discover their love for friends, families and strangers. Instead of making pranks, making money or taking advantage of people, they choose to help people and trying to make the world a better place, with some mild fun along the way. Just like the title says, it is the tiny perfect things that make our life a wonderful place.

"2769","There comes a time, I suppose, when all popular and good ideas are ruined by the replacement with teenage characters or the transference to so-called young adult fiction. Romance, of course, apocalyptic and political thrillers, sci-fi, vampires and werewolves, even socially-conscious message movies and time-travel scenarios, or both (""See You Yesterday"" (2019)). As opposed to the ""Back to the Future"" (1985) variety of manipulating the space time continuum, ""The Map of Tiny Perfect Things"" deals in the ""Groundhog Day"" (1993) style of the time loop. How timely, I guess, given that we've already had ""12 Dates of Christmas"" (2011), ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (2014), part of ""Doctor Strange"" (2016), ""Naked"" (2017), ""Happy Death Day"" (2017) and its sequel, the ""Russian Doll"" series, ""Palm Springs"" (2020) and the upcoming ""Boss Level"" (2021), etc. Live, die, repeat, indeed.Oh, I'm not complaining so much about the repetitiveness of the time-loop genre, which I think is loaded with, if not necessarily infinite, manifold interesting possibilities. ""Groundhog Day"" is an all-time great film, and ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" ""Happy Death Day,"" ""Russian Doll"" and ""Palm Springs,"" at least, each do some different and neat things with the similar scenario. Apart from cinematic and video-game reflexivity, genre twists and philosophical musings, the loop is a wonderful fantasy. The rules vary, but like in this one, it offers immortality. Even if one fancies themselves too good to go god-mode Grand Theft Auto on their no-consequences repeated surroundings, you have the potential for unlimited acquirement of skills and knowledge and for self-betterment. Why would I not want to spend at least a very, very long time in that.To paraphrase George Bernard Shaw or someone I haven't had time to thoroughly read, time travel is wasted on the young. All they do is play the same video game, watch only one film (""Time Bandits"" (1981)), drive the same vehicles, see the same supposedly-magical ""tiny perfect things,"" repeat playing Good Samaritans to slack-jawed amazement, and try to get a kiss. If that is all you're getting from life, yeah, maybe I see why they'd want to get on with it until its inevitable end. It's rather apt, though, how the mystery of the mystery girl plays into this kiss-of-death proposition. Yet, it's still the stupid lecturing to kids on how to deal with emotionally-difficult subjects (death in this case), and it's supposedly ""her story"" as predominantly told from his perspective. I doubt I'll give this one any repeat viewings, but let me know when the second ""Edge of Tomorrow"" or another ""Happy Death Day"" sequel is released.","4","Cineanalyst"," Kiss of Death

"2787","OK, so we, too, have seen it all before - but this features quite an engaging effort from Kyle Allen ""Mark"", who repeats the same day over and over with his family. He encounters ""Margaret' (Katheryn Newton) who is also suffering from the same repetitive scenario and they realise that nothing they do will not be undone next day, and so have some fun together. Of course, they begin to fall in love but she has reservations; steals away every day at the same time and despite his best efforts - and a cleverly concocted map depicting their daily routines - it looks like they are doomed to this groundhog day existence for ever.... What can break their curse? Both the leads are easy on the eye; Allen looks like he might have a musical theatre background as his movements are frequently quite rhythmically synchronised and the pair take this rehashed theme along for about 45 minutes well enough, before it, too, begins to recycle itself. It's young person's film with cute stars. a little bit of chemistry and a modicum of gentle humour as they try to escape their circle of life. It won't be a film we will watch or remember a year from now, probably, but for now it's a perfectly watchable family television feature.","6","CinemaSerf"," Better than average teen movie...

"2788","After the first, terrific 10 minutes, the film falters significantly. Kathryn Newton isn't attractive enough to pique our interest or serve as a credible romantic prize, which is where these things always.They're sexless, as well. They could be any gender.The girl's ignorance is on an essential point is unintentional. Why would one assume that what they're dealing with is in any way Euclidean? She claims that time is not the fourth dimension, when according to Einsteinian spacetime, which superceded the Euclidean, time is indeed the fourth dimension, and there's no reason to think this repetition is only occurring on some Euclidean scale.Then she misunderstands the representation of a fourth, spatial dimension, treating it as a very real thing, then as a kind of metaphor, which is not unreasonable, but it ultimately makes no sense.The search for perfect things is okay, but it's gotten a bit dull and we're only 33m in, and he's in the process of trying to ""win"" the girl, as if she was the what mattered. Ugh.""It's all I got. Take it or leave it."" Way to be a piece of crap. And like a weakling he mumbles he'll accept it. How can boys grow up sanely when this garbage is all they see, day in day out?At the midpoint of the run time he's at his nadir, having made an incredible series of moves that only resulted in a flat and even insulting rejection.The script blunders with an unpleasant exchange between the lead and Al Madrigal, who brings nothing to the role of a needlessly irritated algebra teacher. Why not get a very talented comedian to play the role and shoot for something like a scene between Bill Murray and Ned Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky). With this one, they're not even trying.So he ends up interpreting all this as 'she made me a better man' and that his own life isn't even his story, and we're supposed to believe this is personal progress. Then we get ridiculous 'wisdom' from her mother who's dying of cancer. ""It's never too late, unless you're dying of cancer."" Spare me your delusional American fantasy of hope.It's the horror of contemporary feminism, writ small, but then in having the girl realizing she has feelings for him, it's trying to eat its cake and have it too.
Then she has her realization about all this with Mark's friend, not Mark, which is a poor script decision, though consistent with the narrative abandoning Mark entirely, which is consistent, anyway, with this feminist subversion perversion of Groundhog Day.His function ends up being to comfort her. She actually says, You're here so I wouldn't have to be alone, and he nods along like a good doggy. ""Okay,"" he says.I turned off this travesty with a few minutes left. No, it's not even worth sticking around for the ending.","1","sogoodlooking"," Offensive tripe, a needless, unrewarding feminist subversion of Groundhog Day

"2795","I've read some reviews and I think that some are missing the point of it. Yes, I think it's true that hollywood is annoyingly using the same tropes over and over again. I think that the makers of this movie wanted to give a specific message and tell their story through this unoriginal concept. Some of the negative reviewers are saying that this film has nothing new to offer, but I disagree. I think that it brings up some good questions about life. I really think that this movie is more than just a run of the mill teen romance. It seems like most teen flicks feel the need to be edgy and trashy. While many enjoy that, it isn't everyone's cup of tea.I enjoyed how colorful it is and I thought that the acting was really good. I think that it manages to be quirky without diving into annoying territory. I think that it blended the drama and humor together well. I liked the soundtrack. That one shot scene was done so well!Perhaps this movie is more deep than it's meant to be. I agree with the comments about how it's another teen movie getting all existential, but I still like the way that it was handled. I love good symbolism in any story. The dog represents all the time that can pass by. We see so much but are missing exactly what we're looking for, even when it's right there in front of us. The angel wings. I believe that they represent how there's always good in this world of evil. The eagle catching the fish from the lake. Well, the female character explains that one. Spoiler- rain in stories usually symbolizes the new in life. Washing away the old. It could mean that there's something better. I suppose that there could be even more that I missed.Unfortunately, once again they cast actors that are too old to be playing teens. I also was not a fan of the sob story plot twist near the end.I was also SO disappointed that they ended up kissing at the end. I love stories that are simply just about friendship and I got my hopes up with this one. I almost believed that they wouldn't end up together at the end. It seemed refreshing.I can understand why this movie did not work for some, but I liked it. I watched it on valentine's day. It's also a good movie for february because of groundhog day!","8","Peaceful224"," You're probably misunderstanding

"2797","Movie afternoon with Gertie.A re-run of 'Groundhog Day' for pandemically bored tweenagers. The film starts with a bravura opening sequence. Something falls, he's there to catch it; someone falls in the swimming pool, he's there to catch them. What kind of superhero is this kid? It's a brightly shot, terrifically edited introduction, although Allen's smug confidence begins to grate quickly.The film eventually switches things up by bringing on Margaret, who is uninterested in Mark, but in the same temporal freeze. Newton brings an engaging honesty to the super-smart Margaret, and at times Grossman's dialogue is sharp. This is glossy and undemanding, and perfect froa

A real a*** screenwriter would take the idea of the best comedy ever and just copy it for the lack of creativity, own ideas, visions or any other capabilities (a***es lack these). And then change a tiny detail and say: 'Look, it's a different movie!'That's exactly what happened here; don't believe anyone who tells you, that is not Groundhog Day, coz it is just that but the Michel-Bay-version of it. The only thing changed is the solution of coming out of the circle, which makes no sense, has no meaning, is pseudo-math-BS and makes this copy even worse.Everything in this movie is phony, false, has been made better somewhere else; it has no charm, no soul, even the protagonists have this teflon-plastic aura.Who may like this movie: tasteless pricks, school bullies, or kids who have no clue that Groundhog Day even exists. Watching this tripe they will be traumatized and may never watch the Original or excellent versions of the material like Edge of Tomorrow or Palm Springs (these managed to make sth new of it).Don't believe the good reviews, this is either family or guys with agenda.Finally I must admit, it may have some entertainment value for teenagers, but even that is mediocre fun.","1","stklaus"," Most unscrupulous try to cash in with a movie in history.

"2812","There's no creativity to the wardrobe, everyone just wears whatever without metaphorical value. They throw around words like temporal anomaly and singularity without any further explanation to this infallible idea and believe we should understand it. The movie ends by wrapping up the most insignificant subplot. Almost every conversation our characters have are what they should do with infinite time, and during these conversations, they never stay still: they do something out of the ordinary and act like it's perfectly normal. Literally every side-character is generic and useless, as they serve the same metaphor. I was vastly uninterested in these characters to the point where when the movie Psycho'd itself and replaced the main character, I was tempted to stop watching. The actual titular map only shows up twice. There are about six montages in this film and they are all useless.The Map of Tiny Perfect Things is the reason I'm happy film is highly flammable.

The central actors are charming enough, but can't compare to the pair in Palm Springs. Nor does the movie do anything original with the concept.Which is a shame because in the last third of the movie, two ideas are tossed out casually that actually do bring something original to the table. However, THIS movie is only concerned with re-visiting the tropes of the genre so those ideas aren't explored at all.No spoilers here but the central idea is: Instead of trying to break out of the loop, what if there was a compelling reason to stay within the time loop... so compelling that you would do anything to prevent it?Imagine what you could do with that idea instead.

"2823","""We're the ones sleeping. Everyone else is awake, and it's just us dreaming. I know it's going to hurt really bad. But I think that I have to wake up now.""The Map of Tiny Perfect Things follows a teenager contentedly living the same day in an endless loop who gets his world turned upside-down when he meets a girl who's also stuck in the time warp. What follows is a love story with a fantastical twist, as the two struggle to figure out how and whether to escape their never ending day. I didn't realize this was a time-loop movie when I put it on. A few minutes in there's one of those classic scenarios where the character is mimicking and moving around the setting well. Palm Springs did this well last summer. I kind of groaned at the fact that this is another one of those movies, but it didn't disappoint me in anyway. Surprisingly, I found myself entertained and liking some of it. The style is fun. The way it's presented hooked me in. Kyle Allen as the leading guy is a good casting choice here. Since this is geared towards teens, everyone has this fun nature. Kathryn Newton has been appearing in many things lately. I like her as an actress and she does well here. The two work well together. The romance element is bound to happen from the beginning and I guess it worked here. With all the charming moments, these two use the best qualities of themselves and characters to make an enjoyable time. It is an entertaining watch.Obviously, we've seen so many of these types of movies that it does become redundant. The movie thinks it's smarter than it actually is with the direction it takes. Kathryn Newton's character, for example, has a secret that she's trying to hide. When it's actually revealed, there's nothing new here and it feels forced. A good portion of the script feels forced. The runtime overstays it's welcome. At one point I thought it was getting close to the third act, but I wasn't even halfway done. There's so much it's trying to accomplish but it really needed to go a simpler route. The movie is still entertaining and fun at times but it also feels way too familiar making it average. I can't say too much about The Map of Tiny Perfect Things. Usually I don't take a liking to this kind of movie but it's charming enough watch for some to enjoy.","6","sweidman-28016"," Nothing New Here

"2825","I've watched this once all the way through, and then again to the half-way point a week or so later after puzzling over it. -Partly because I liked the male lead and some of the story mechanics, but also because the weak and broken points of this movie were fascinating; ""How would I fix this?""Broken things are interesting.So.., I liked the male lead; he seemed genuine and kind. The actor made it seem effortless.The girl, by contrast, was stuck having to portray an anti-social and quite unlikable character. The production team worked the actress hard only to achieve a thoroughly forced caricature of the 'strong, independent woman', constantly sneering at the male half of the human equation. If that's the day you find yourself stuck in... Heaven help you.Now, with more self-awareness, this element could have provided fodder for a very interesting film indeed, but most of the psychology responsible was happening beyond the cognition of the creators, down on some automatic level. True, there was an inkling of character growth, (partly the reason I didn't write this movie off entirely and came back for a second look), where the female lead recognized that, ""I met a nice boy, but I messed it all up"", drawing a useful conclusion between behavior and outcome, but that lesson was smothered beneath external ideological demands the writer wasn't free of. So instead, the film was primarily an exercise in artificially elevating the feminine at the expense of the masculine.I'm guessing that the film makers don't know that truly strong women out here in the real world are completely different.Genuinely strong women don't have to be snide, secretive, emotionally shallow fakes in order to hold power. That's what weak, bitter people do in an effort to compensate. People actually LIKE being around genuinely strong women, are indeed guided and changed by them in ways this film hasn't managed to divine. Folks really need to get out there and encounter the feminine principle in person sometime, and for goodness sake, avoid feeling threatened to the point of attacking it when they do.So.., my advice to the creative team responsible, allow me to mansplain: In the future, (heh), don't let some post-modern ideology poison what could have been a strong and inspiring film. This was like a chocolate bar which had been made with sour milk.Too bad.","6","Safetylight"," Feminists re-make Groundhog Day, for teens. It goes about as well as it could have.

"2827","Contemporary Groundhog Day story which is done pretty well. Solid characters and performances throughout, along with the storyline that should keep your interest peaked. The only flaw in the movie is that they had to include a couple liberal ideals; global warming and climate change , which are both just power grab hoaxes by globalist elites. One of the lead characters even shows a bit of hypocrisy on this subject, mentioning her concern for climate change, but almost in the same sentence wonders what the world will be like when she's 80 years old. Aren't these climate change zealots constantly reminding us all that the World will end in another 10 years???

I assume a profound ""meaning of life"" message was supposed to be hidden in there, too. If it were, it's been done so many times before that blends into the bland plot and is therefore unrecognizable.This may be okay for preteens and early teens whose cinematic experience is limited, but mature folks will be underwhelmed.","5","Jungle_Jim"," 90-minute underwhelming lead-up to a cliché ending

"2833","It's not often I'm surprised by how I feel about a film. Usually prior to going in I know exactly what I'll think of it once it's over. But in this case, I was wrong.I was expecting yet another teenage treacle plot with the central characters pontificating on the ""beauty of the world"" with terms far beyond their years. But what I instead got was an extremely sweet, relevant tale about time and growing up that is both important for young viewers and nostalgic for old.The performances are pitch perfect. Whoever cast these two leads is very good at their job. The main actor I had never seen in anything before but he plays this reminiscent of Heath Ledger in 10 Things I Hate About You, and that is something to be extremely proud of. He looks and acts much like the posthumous legend and I'm excited to see what he'll do in the future. Kathryn Newton is once again excellent, continuing her Big Little Lies stride and emanating a very sweet vulnerability that would make any teenage boy blush.It's very refreshing to watch a film where the director allows the actors to simply act. There are moments that just hold on the faces of the leads to let the audience seep into their emotional states and builds your relationship with them. It's funny, bright, and hopeful by the end of the film with a nice message from this formula that at this point could well be rote but the talent behind the script and cast proves otherwise.","7","Dragava"," A Wonderful Surprise

"2834","Movies and TV are mostly just plain horrible, so a perfectly OK film is like a masterpiece in comparison. This is a messed-up way to look at the world, but welcome to lock-down where I have more time on my hands than these two teens.This began with promise, so much that I stopped and tracked down the short story it's based on. The story wasn't much and seemed so self-conscious about stealing the idea from the movie Groundhog Day that it never really took on a life of its own-this is also the problem with the film.It tries to be sweet, and for that I rank it higher than I normally would, but it just doesn't have a lot going for it.I'm not really sure about the lead actress and why she wasn't right in this. Usually I blame bad acting on the director, but I'm not sure it was bad acting or just her terrible hair. Either way, it she didn't fit, not for me. The kid wasn't much better. There were no decent secondary roles.

That being said I wasn't necessarily expecting much from The Map of Tiny Perfect Things, as it has middling reviews and seemed to be flying under the radar in terms of internet chatter, but boy was I surprised.This movie is such a joy to watch. It just does pretty much everything right, from the characters, the style, the direction, the script, the plot, the soundtrack. Just beautiful.Kathryn Newton was incredible as Margaret, and had great chemistry with Kyle Allen. Both of their characters were well thought out and were played to perfection. Their interactions always felt real and both of them felt lived in and relatable.In terms of the plot, it really was quite special. It had some great messages in there, from taking a moment to stop and appreciate life, to learning to move on and live life. It explored all of its themes in quite profound ways at times, through effective comedy and tender emotional moments.There's lots to digest with this film, as we jump between different genres. We sort of get teen romance, a bit of sci-fi, comedy, coming of age drama, and tragedy all in the space of an hour and a half.On top of all of this the film just has such a great vibe.

"2845","As a sexagenarian, I am not the target audience for this film but I like anything that is good. I was thumbing through my Roku looking for a movie to play while I gamed and read a book. The reason I stopped to play this film was because I had seen Kathryn Newton the previous day in ""Freaky."" She is very good here as she was in that film.Another reviewer said that they were ""drawn into the film"" and so was I. My gaming stopped as did the book reading and my attention became focused on MTPT. I found it charming and Ms. Newton was very good as was Jermaine Harris, but felt that Mr. Allen failed to deliver on some one word lines that would have improved the quality of his performance and the film. The director should have caught these and worked with him on the line deliveries and the fact that he did not may represent a shortfall in Ian Samuels' ability, at least this point in his career.Overall, a very nice and charming little film, which is the type I love to find. A lot of reviewers are rating this a nine, but I'm a hard marker and will give it a seven, which is pretty good since I gave Hitchcock's ""Foreign Correspondent"" a six.Well worth your time and attention.","7","accounstv"," Very nice

"2847","We really enjoyed this movie, it is well written and never lost our interest. It borrows from Groundhog Day and the characters even mention that movie, comparing their experience to it.It turns out two people, teenagers, a boy and a girl, both of them refer to their experience as a temporal anomaly, a disruption in the spacetime continuum which can be related to time travel. At precisely midnight each day they each revert to waking up time again, repeating the same day.In this mode they experience an increasing number of ""tiny perfect things"" in daily life, eventually he creates a map of their community noting the place and time of each one. Thus the name of the movie.It isn't just a time-loop comedy, it also has serious themes of appreciating life and the people around you. In a sense it parallels Groundhog Day in that they can't get out of the loop until they acknowledge and accept certain things in their lives.Good movie, my wife and I watched it at home on Amazon streaming.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","TxMike"," A slight departure from Groundhog Day, the movie.

"2850","3.5 out of 5 stars.The Map of Tiny Perfect Things is a pretty fair film. Having a similiar concept of Groundhog Day or Edge of Tomorrow where characters repeat the same day over and over. Mark (Kyle Allen) is an ordinary teen. Repeating the same day. Avoiding the talk with his father about his future. Avoiding in taking in interest with his father and sister. He seems to know the town well after repeating everything. Until he meets Margaret (Kathryn Newton) who is the other person repeating the same day with him. She seems to be avoiding something and does not mind doing the same day over. While the two have fun and trying to find clues to why they are stuck in a time loop.The plot is pretty decent. Two characters stuck in a time loop. While the film does have fun for the first hour or so with them doing anything without having to worry about people remembering the next day. It does lose itself in the second hour when Mark is trying to get with Margaret.The cast is great. Kyle Allen and Kathryn Newton are good with there roles. The film plays with familiar concepts from other films. Even like Palm Springs film. But the direction does lose its fun tone when the romance story does feel dull. The story does have a little meaning behind it. About living your life.","7","cruise01"," Enjoyable romantic sci fi drama that has familiar concepts but meaning.

"2851","I am having a hard time believing that Liam Neeson is the guy living in the US south, close to the border, carrying the American flag on his shoulder (5 min in the film) and still speaking with his infamous tone of voice and accent... I think if he hadn't been casted for this, then it would have been a completely uninteresting film. Yes it's a Liam Neeson movie...same like a Nick Cage movie...we watch it to see Liam doing something. But it's not Taken or anything like that. And it's not exactly action/thriller; 40% of the film is a subtle social commentary. I had fun watching it but come on, was that film necessary?

"2852","My love for Liam Neeson knows no bounds - no matter how many mediocre movies he stars in, I will always watch the next one, in hopes that maybe my expectations will be subverted and I will be treated to a good film. Unfortunately, in the last few years, Mr. Neeson has starred in a string of mediocre movies. ""Taken 3"" is bad beyond description, mainly due to its atrocious editing style. ""Cold Pursuit"" attempted to go the dark comedy route, and in my opinion, missed its mark. ""Honest Thief"" was painfully banal, filled with stilted acting and a noticeable lack of action. And now we have ""The Marksman,"" another entry in the mediocre Liam Neeson movie genre.""The Marksman"" is less of an action thriller and more of a drama, and that's not inherently bad. However, the movie boasts an astounding lack of suspense and tension throughout, plodding along from scene to scene until the inevitable final confrontation - which to the film's credit, is exciting. However, before you have the pleasure of watching that, you have to sit through a long, slow, road-trip style adventure, that lacks any type of thrill. Sure, you'll find one or two intermittent ""action"" scenes during the course of the movie, but these scenes barely contain any worthwhile action. There is a poorly filmed fistfight that lasts about 10 seconds, as well as a mild getaway type of scenario that our hero has to escape from, and that's about it.Because of its lack of action, the main draw of ""The Marksman"" is its actors, namely Liam Neeson and Jacob Perez. Liam Neeson is good with what the script has him do, and I enjoyed his character. A previous member of the Marine Corp, Liam's character, Jim, struggles with alcohol, and is unapologetically atheist, which I found interesting for a character in a mainstream film. While I was originally opposed to watching a movie with a child actor in it, because of how bad child actors usually are, Jacob Perez was, to my surprise, pretty good. He could pull off emotion when he needed to, but mostly he was likeable, and it was enjoyable to watch him and Liam interact. There was some good comedy throughout, and some interesting conversations between the two characters, but that leads me into some more negatives.Unfortunately, for a movie that is so dialogue heavy, a lot of the dialogue was very boring. There were so many opportunities for the characters to argue or engage in a verbal battle because of their own respective beliefs and morals, but the script took the easy way out it seems, instead employing a large use of exposition. Additionally, for a movie that takes place on the road, it doesn't look very good. The cinematography and directing is very basic, almost as if this was originally a made for television film that at the last minute the studios decided to release in theatres.When the action starts, it is exciting, specifically the battle at the end. Liam pulls off some badass moves, and he puts his rifle to work. However, at this point the movie was too little, too late, and I was so disengaged that I was more looking forward for it to end. In case it wasn't clear - I still love Liam Neeson, and I'll never stop watching his movies. However, at the end of ""The Marksman,"" I almost found myself asking if I should even bother anymore.","5","darkreignn"," Less of an action film and more of a bland, road-trip style drama

"2855","This is only the second film by director Robert Lorenzo. Who's he? Exactly. He is best known as an assistant director and producer of mostly Clint Eastwood films and some great ones like Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby. His first solo film is Trouble with the Curve where the main role is played, surprisingly, by Clint Eastwood himself. I really liked that movie. The difference between this and this film is the script, this time he wrote it himself and it is not good at all. It is often predictable, one-way, and uneven. Overall though, I can't judge the film with Liam Neeson where he plays himself badly. He will turn 69 this year, and he is still making films like this. I call this a typical Liam Neeson movie, if you've watched one in the last ten years, you've watched it all. A gloomy man with a difficult and vulnerable past who does not look for troubles but they find him, and he possesses special skills that he is forced to use. The good thing about movies like this is that you know you're going to get what you expected, and all of those movies are good or very good, they won't disappoint you. Same thing with this movie. If you're going to look for holes in the script or criticize the characters, then this is not the movie for you. If you're looking for a movie that will entertain you or take a break from your commitments for a hundred minutes, and you're a fan of Mr. Neeson like me then I can definitely recommend this movie to you.","6","ivanmessimilos"," Standard Liam Neeson movie

"2862","Greetings again from the darkness. Liam Neeson's particular set of skills, and his grumpy face, seem to show up on screen most every January. If there is a surprise to this year's entry, it's that the annual Liam action movie is not directed by Jaume Collet-Sera, as were THE COMMUTER (2018), RUN ALL NIGHT (2015), NON-STOP (2014), and UNKNOWN (2011). Mr. Collet-Sera has apparently traded Liam in for The Rock as his go-to action star. Instead, it's director Robert Lorenz (TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE, 2012) who co-wrote the script with two other first time screenwriters, Chris Charles and Danny Kravitz. As with most (not all) of Mr. Neeson's aging-action-hero films, this one is both watchable and forgettable.Jim Hanson (Neeson) is a struggling Arizona cattle rancher. He's also a flag-flying former Marine, who carries a walkie-talkie so he can immediately inform the Border Patrol whenever he spots ""IAs"" (illegal aliens) crossing his land. Jim is a shell of his former self ever since his beloved wife passed away. He spread her ashes on the hill next to his rundown home ... a home that sits on land in the final stages of bank foreclosure. Her daughter Sarah (Katheryn Winnick, ""Vikings"") is part of the Border Patrol and periodically keeps tabs on Jim.Although he never seems to care much for those crossing the border, Jim's quick to offer a drink to anyone stranded and injured, even as he calls the Border Patrol. A young boy and his pleading mother are no different until a carload of cartel boys show up. The subsequent shootout leaves a couple of people dead and ignites a cross-country cat-and-mouse chase. A previous scene from Mexico taught us that the mother, Rosa (Teresa Ruiz), and her son, Miguel (Jacob Perez), were sent on the run thanks to her brother's crossing of the cartel. Mauricio (Juan Pablo Raba, THE 33, 2015) is the intimidating cartel soldier sent to kill the mother and son.The story covers Monday through Saturday, in what would be considered a stressful week for just about anyone. Jim had promised Miquel's mother that he would take the boy to her cousin's home in Chicago, and being the good soldier, he is committed to fulfilling his duty. Along the way, the grizzled old man and the angry young boy bond while driving in Jim's bullet-riddled pickup truck. Hot dogs and hamburgers play a role, but mostly a late confrontation in a barn attempts to add some character development to a story that, to this point, had very little.Filmmaker Lorenz has a history with Clint Eastwood, and offers up a respectful nod to his mentor by including a grainy scene from HANG 'EM HIGH on a motel television. There is surprisingly little political commentary included, which actually adds to the slowness and dryness of the material. Liam Neeson is now 68 years old, and he has developed a nice little niche for himself with these action movies that are interesting enough to burn a couple of hours for viewers.","6","ferguson-6"," Liam on the move again

"2864","...and that's not necessarily a bad thing. But what disappoints me here is that there were three amateur writers, with this film as their first ever writing credit (Chris Charles, Danny Kravitz and Robert Lorenz - who also directed), and I wish they'd consulted a seasoned writer - and making a point to tell that writer that Liam Neeson was the lead.For their first writing credit, it wasn't that bad, but the 108 min runtime wasn't used effectively. It either needed to be trimmed down to about 80 mins - for the current story and pacing, or (and I would've preferred this) fill those minutes with more action and suspense. And that's not even considering Neeson was cast, and we all know we crave his action. So not getting that action, was a huge let down. Even the title of this film, only fills 5 minutes of the 108, and that's pretty sad - and a waste. There were a few plot and technical issues, as well as some content that should've been omitted i.e. bank issues, especially how that bonfire was fueled (without giving away any spoilers), which in my opinion was dumb.This was also Lorenz's 2nd directing credit, and considering that, his work was impressive. The scenes were fluid, camera work on point, and it seemed the cast had great direction from him. The cinematography and score were also decent. It's a recommended watch - because of Neeson, but I wouldn't see it again, and probably forget about it down the road. It's a 7/10 from me.","7","Top_Dawg_Critic"," Amateur production...

Very sad for such a good actor and still well capable of pulling off a good one!This is just another anti-trump, poor immigrant road movie.Hardly much action and even the action is a bit tame and lame and Liam just seems to sleepwalk his way through this, perhaps he realised it was going to be a bit of a turkeyburger after the first 10 mins.It has its positives with quite lush photography and is more like a travelogue across America than a movie and contains more relatively boring dialogue than the usual Neeson vehicle; some scenes however; particularly regarding his dead wife are quite sad as it must have been quite hard for Neeson to perform them as it was exactly what happened to his real life wife and you can almost feel this in his delivery of those lines.

"2872","The Marksman is an action-thriller co-written
and directed by Robert Lorenz. He is best known
for his collaborations with Clint Eastwood as assistant director and producer in iconic films such as Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River and American Sniper. This is his second feature-length film to date. The plot follows a former marine-turned-rancher named Jim Hanson (Liam Neeson) who stumbles upon Rosa and Miguel, a mother and a son who are being hunted by cartel assassins along the Arizona-Mexican border. Thus he brings it on himself
to stage an intervention. The narrative is reminiscent
to Road to Perdition and Logan where the titular
character forms an eventual bond with a youth in danger.But I would recommend that you watch those films
instead as you will receive far more satisfaction as opposed to The Marksman which is a pretty forgettable film,
in my opinion. The storyline is straightforward, predictable, and as clichéd as it sounds. It contained recycled material that we've witnessed over the years and it's the reason why
I would not advise anyone to consume their precious time with this film. Only if you are an avid follower of Liam Neeson's filmography and you personally enjoy seeing him in these action-fueled roles which is still astonishing to me given his age. The actor clearly has more fight in him before he decides to hang up the boxing gloves.He was only the benefactor for this experience as the
film lacks many redeeming qualities. Especially with the selling point for this film which is the relationship between Jim Hansen and Miguel. I didn't fully accept it as their characters weren't fleshed out enough, and that same issue contributed to my dissatisfaction with the supporting cast members as well as their uninspiring performances.This isn't the worst of film of the new year.But it isn't an exceptional one by any means.Follow me on Instagram: @joshuarenealvarez

"2874","I should preface this review by saying I saw this movie in theaters, with my mom who said it would be a good movie and people were saying it was good. The way it was described was misleading, the trailer made some very questionable choices so walking into the theatre I went in completely impartial, I wasn't expecting good I wasn't expecting bad. The film is extremely mediocre and safe, you don't learn anything or come away with a different point of view, which is what the film intended. The frame rate was extremely high and while that sounds like a good thing it was genuinely nauseating. It felt like a rollercoaster with how everything moved and happened. While the cinematography was great the story wasn't. The Villans make unreasonable choices that drive the plot. While at the end there's a decent character arc for the main villain, the hero doesn't. Most characters don't really change and the morale and character traits feel very forced. The film seems somewhat political and while that's not necessarily a bad thing or a film killer it wants to change the opinion of boarder control activists. It boarder line shoves the message down your throat. If your a film buff you may have noticed the plot isn't original, it's leon: the professional. The plot is very similar except for the ""on the run"" aspect of the film, while I don't think it's bad for it to take a little inspiration it doesn't feel original at all.

This should get the Understatement of the Year award. Cliched script, plodding direction, bad acting: Katheryn Winnick, in a pointless bit part, was the only female presence of any note and most of her acting was done by her low-cut tops (which every self-respecting State police woman wears as standard issue). Mr. Neeson's character looked genuinely tired and frustrated with his life, but this did not require any acting on his part, the script took care of it. Everybody else looked like they were doing a chore. Dialogue was awful and seemed like teased with pliers. Action was sparse and not entertaining, and the chemistry between the lone old man and the boy non-existent. And then, there were the plot holes... Oh my, where does one begin: seasoned cartel enforcers walk casually uncovered on open fields knowing that may be targeted through a rifle scope. A man shot and stabbed several times can, of course, typically drive for several miles afterwards. Nobody even bats an eyelid when a person covered in blood marks gets on a public bus staggering. One can go on.Shame for Liam, really, who has given us some very decent and entertaining movies, even late in his career.

"2887","Greetings film goers! Are you looking for a movie that tells a story which has no basis in reality and only exists as a piggyback to Liam Nieson's career? Hope so!I'm a huge Liam Nieson fan. Unfortunately, he seemingly will forever be in ""Taken"" remakes of various varieties. Even worse, BAD Taken remakes with terrible plots. Well, if you've found this review, you've also found 'The Marksman' (or, Taken 10).Another unfortunate outcome of this movie is the predictable acting. Liam Nieson plays the role which they hired him and in true fashion, he does it very well. But, we've seen this role about a million times now. I like Katheryn Winnick as an actress and would like to see her in more films. However, like Nieson, her acting chops can't fill the gap of a boring, pointless character who has no real purpose. Waste of talent IMO. And, I think that's the underlying story here = BORING characters and predictable Hollywood plots.This story feels recycled and we've seen this one over and over again. Even worse, it has no basis in reality. The story is nonsensical and feels like Hollywoods take on what they THINK happens at the border. Well, if you can imagine how uninformed they are regarding average ordinary life... you can imagine their take on the border situation.In summary, if this film had any other starring actor other than Liam Nieson, it would have been on Lifetime or some obscure cable channel. Waste of good acting talent. Waste of good West Texas scenery. Waste of your time. If you like Nieson, go see Cold Pursuit. It's a MUCH better movie where Liam Nieson essentially plays the EXACT SAME character but is much better written/directed.","3","cmhouser"," Nonsensical story that goes nowhere...

The child portraying Miguel isnt perfect but hes better than me so theres that
The villains are your avsrage pack of goons trying to kill the protagonists.
But the gist of this movie is not the beging nor the ending. Its the JOURNEY Traveling across america with a mission in mind to get Miguel his family.

"2913","""I don't scare easy"". Of course you don't. You're Liam freaking Neeson. You're the butt-kicking ruler of the AARP. Neeson looking like Sean Penn's older brother with scruff and mustache in tote, stars in 2021's The Marksman.""Marksman"" is another Neeson actioner where Neeson is the antihero, preserver, and everyman all rolled into one. As something about a rancher who tries to protect a kid illegal alien from a nasty cartel, ""Marksman"" is veritable Neeson comfort food. You want to see him in this role, you know he can carry the proceedings, you know he looks cool handling a firearm, and you know he'll deliver a certain level of badassery. At 68 years old, Liam Neeson makes the villains (who are decades younger than him) bow down with bruised envy. All I gotta say to them is ""good luck"".So yeah, The Marksman is also assembly line Neeson. And yup, the film feels improbable with a few plot devices that might have gone AWOL. Still, there's entertainment value to be had with ""Marksman"" being an old, comfortable show a la the man with ""a particular set of skills"". In truth, ""Marksman"" is a savage road trip flick with inching tension, snarling thugs, and roving danger right around the corner. And oh yeah, you never mess with a broken down, former Marine who loves his guns, his steaks, his late wife, and his swigged whisky.""Marksman's"" director (Robert Lorenz of Trouble with the Curve fame) moves things at a fast, tasty clip. Along with the insertion of a paternal relationship, there are unwanted killings, well-staged gunfights, a house burning, and a car chase or two. Lorenz fashions The Marksman as a pseudo Western combined with a version of Gran Torino that doesn't take place in one city. Bottom line: You can ""mark"" The Marksman as a must-see.","7","burlesonjesse5"," VIEWS ON FILM review of The Marksman

"2922","Other reviewers have given the makers of this screen story a bit of an undeserved caning.Is it genre-fare written to an apparent familiar formula? Yes. There is a practical limit to how many stories can be really original any more.The story backbone has been told in many forms before and being a writer, I had a fair clue how it was going to conclude. The characters were drawn well by their respective actors.Was the story well executed? Yes I think it was. It was also raised beyond slam, bamm and drink the bourbon. Any more detail and I will be publishing spoilers.Contrary to the genre, the young character wass written without smart backanswers, emotional hystrionics and generally unlikeable behaviour towards adults.The writers wisely avoided the cliche of victim aggression and acting out towards the rescuer in some sort of emotional and revelationary rehook into a new story chapter. That has been overdone so much over the years as to be maukish.The young actor gives a surprisingly restrained performance, maybe influenced by Liam Neeson or carefully directed or both.There were opportunities in the story for a director to be tempted into a few clammy cliches which were thankfully avoided.The locations were not recognisable from other movies so that was a refreshing change.With the music underscore, I was quite impressed. Part of the head and tail bookends seem to be homage to two other films from the 80s and 90s in their arrangement and tone colours. However they were entirely original and skillfully woven.The underscore through the film does not draw attention and may have been even left absent for all I know. That is when underscores work best. No musical distractions were necessary anywhere to ""save"" the film. That speaks for the work done by the writer and director more so than folk may realise.If you have the opportunity to see the film in a cinema, I recommend you do so.","8","darangulafilm"," THE MARKSMAN.

"2924","Our late career action hero Liam Neeson is back in what Clint Eastwood have starred decades of his acting career as Jim Hanson in ""The Marksman"".Katheryn Winnick co-stars in this film directed by Robert Lorenz.In it,we get to see an Arizona border patrol member who protects a young Mexican boy who is desperately fleeing from the assassins of a cartel. As he gets to the border in Arizona,we get to see the cartel pursues the young boy as the latter gets to land in the US.The movie was definitely serviceable at best. No question that Liam Neeson delivers as Jim - the marksman - which is enough to make it entertaining. Also, we get to see him morphing into the new Clint Eastwood. Evidently, Neeson will continue to delight his movie fans (me included) with the future action thrillers that has yet to come.","7","Desertman84"," Our Late Career Action Hero Liam Neeson Is Back As Clint Eastwood In The Marksman

"2947","The cliches fly like bullets in ""Trouble With the Curve"" director Robert Lorenz's formulaic cartel thriller ""The Marksman,"" with rugged Liam Neeson as a troubled ex-Marine who swaps lead with murderous Mexican cartel killers on a road trip to Chicago. Tom Hanks took an orphan girl across Texas to her relatives in ""News of the World,"" and Neeson takes a Mexican boy from Arizona to Illinois in this modern-day crime melodrama. When a mom and her son scramble across the border on foot with cartel gunmen at their heels, a widowed American rancher, Jim Hanson intervenes with his rifle and thwarts their pursuit with gunfire. Now, ""The Marksman"" isn't a movie bristling with wall-to-wall violence. Several people die, and some die off-screen. Nevertheless, this predictable but complicated, PG-rated, pursuit yarn often stretches credibility to the breaking point. Lorenz and freshman writers Chris Charles and Danny Kravitz give us nothing we haven't seen already in gritty, suspenseful sagas like ""No Country for Old Men"" (2007), ""Savages"" (2012), ""End of Watch"" (2012),""The Last Stand"" (2013), Sicario"" (2015), its sequel ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"" (2018), ""Miss Bala (2019), ""Peppermint"" (2018), and ""Rambo: Last Blood"" (2019). Instead, Lorenz and company recycle moldy cliches and stale stereotypes, with few surprises. Occasionally, our seasoned hero has some ""Rambo"" moments, but few and far between are these. Our protagonist often behaves like he has never seen a television crime show. This 107-minute movie may unravel your patience. Not only has our hero forgotten everything he learned in two tours of Vietnam, but he also doesn't realize they are tracking him via his credit card purchases. Indeed, the Liam Neeson character makes several appalling mistakes during his flight that will infuriate audiences who craved his ""Taken"" movies.
Jim (Liam Neeson of ""Cold Pursuit"") has fallen on hard times with no relief in sight. After cancer claimed his wife, an avalanche of medical bills descended on him, and he cannot pay them. Now, his friendly banker warns him he is 90 days away from eviction from hearth and home. Basically, Jim is a lost soul when he nearly runs down a young migrant woman, Rosa (Teresa Ruiz of ""Bordertown""), and her 11-year-old son Miguel (newcomer Jacob Perez) who have abandoned everything in their flight to Arizona. Rosa's ill-fated brother Carlos (Alfredo Quiroz of ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"") who served as a courier for the cartel let his greed doom him. Moments before the cartel catches up with him, Carlos warns Rosa to vamos before they come for their pound of flesh. The cartel makes examples of their own when they betray them. Jim didn't have enough to worry about before he nearly collided with Rosa and Miguel in the road, he does now. Basically, the border wall fence lines Jim's ranch in southern Arizona, and the rancher is dutifully making his rounds when he catches these innocents trespassing. During a brief firefight, Jim drives off the killers, but not before poor Rosa takes a slug and dies at the scene. Mind you, things are about to get far worse. Now, Jim wrestles with his conscience because he feels responsible for Rosa's death. The cartel retreat to lick their wounds, and Jim calls the Border Patrol. Before she died, Rosa had pleaded desperately with Jim to help them. Now, as guilt sets in, Jim realizes he must help Rosa's son. If Miguel is deported back to Mexico, the cartel will turn him into one of their own.
Up until this point, ""The Marksman"" has shown promise. We want our tough guy hero with a heart of gold to save Miguel and slaughter these cartel crazies. However, everything falters when Jim asks to see Miguel at the Border Patrol Station. Just before he walks into the facility, Jim spots Mauricio (Juan Pablo Raba of ""Peppermint"") and his minions waiting outside the station. Now, all the Border Patrol Agents are chummy with Jim because his stepdaughter, Sarah (Katheryn Winnick of ""Failure to Launch""), works there as a Border Patrol Agent, too. Inside the station, a Border Patrolman against his better impulses gives Jim a moment with Miguel because he must catch an urgent call. Our hero displays his sense of audacity when he ushers little Miguel out of the holding room as well as the Border Patrol Station in plain sight of everybody. Nobody spots him on the surveillance monitors, and he cruises off with Miguel sitting beside him in his battered pick-up truck. Mind you, during the abortive firefight at the border, the cartel riddled Jim's truck with a hail of gunfire. Incredibly, Jim hasn't bothered to repair the damage, so he has been driving around with a punctured radiator, but he hasn't noticed it leaking! Jim plans to take Miguel to his relatives in Chicago, but Miguel isn't talking to him.
Miguel holds Jim responsible for his mother's death. Nevertheless, these two will forge a friendship that defies ethnicity and age. Jim makes his second mistake when he trusts his truck to hold together with a patch job after Mauricio and company had peppered it with bullet holes. Incidentally, Jim doesn't have a cell phone because he has no one to call. One of the grimmest scenes occurs when Mauricio pumps a vulnerable female gas station clerk full of bullets when she refuses to help him. Like Mauricio's hoodlums, we are outside the convenience store when the gun shots ring out with ominous clarity. If the villains were despicable when they strung up Carlos from an overpass, the murder of the helpless girl makes them cold-blooded dastards. Eventually, our noble hero catches a slug in the gut, and Mauricio dices him up with a knife to ribs. A sentimental saga with a dreary ending, ""The Marksman"" never scores enough bullseyes to keep us engrossed in his plight. If you abhor movies where you can guess the outcome long before the heroes and the villains, you're going to be grumbling throughout ""The Marksman.""","5","zardoz-13"," Misses the Mark

One thing I admire though is the acting performance with the Mexican thug antagonist, was really impressive and convincing and made me love his acting a lot than anyone else in the movie.

"2960","An incredibly beautiful drama/western redemption story complemented by beautiful cinematography. The movie doesn't just show or tell; it PULLS the audience into the lives of Jim and Miguel, fully investing them into their journey. It was so wonderfully moving to watch their characters grow. When the credits rolled, I sat there, wishing I could just see what happened next in their lives. Liam Neeson's acting prowess only adds to the experience - witnessing him swing between ex-marine badass to loving caretaker is a complete delight. The story is topical and feels real, which only helps immerse the viewer mentally and emotionally. Previously, I had never seen a movie where the audience applauded at the climax of the story. But now I can say that I have.","10","wittstockwilliam"," A Drama/Western Guaranteed to Move Any Viewer

"2961","A generic thriller of those that Liam Nesson always does.
It is about a sailor who helps a family cross the border and faces a cartel for them, taking the little boy with his close relatives.
Quality.
Entertaining.
Some performances are not performances, they are linear and without expression.
Unbelievable to the extreme.
Although it lacks more action, it grabs a bit more of the suspense.
Few action scenes and stunts, some are poorly executed.
What little it tries to develop leaves it unfinished.

The director must have taken this project out of boredom because it shows in every frame, the movie could have been made in thirty minutes if the dull boring scenes had been removed and the predictable and unrealistic scenes had been combined to the conclusion that we knew was coming.

"2964","I think there are several compelling factors about this movie that need to be pointed out, if they haven't already been done so. Number one, some fresh takes on some old themes. What I liked most among these was the soldier mentality and code of honor exhibited by both the main villain and the hero, the fact that they both have something in common... or, at least, it is perceived that way. The fact that the villain keeps one of Henson's military medals, offering it up to him in the end, relinquishing his envy for the man and in return, gaining a little bit of respect... enough to have earned a 'soldier's choice' (how you die).
The young boy with the deep soul. The first thing we learn about him is that his ambitions in love give him a kind of divine confidence and the ability to see beauty anywhere (even from a sunlit gummy bear). He understands his mother's death and is able to process it in such a way that guides Liam NÃ©e son's character. After the death of the dog, the trip to the church to pay respects to Miguel's mother, was a much needed reprieve in the storyline and one you don't often find in this type of action-thriller.
I thought this movie was well blended with action and drama. Enough action to create suspense, enough drama to keep your attention. Overall, I would give it ten stars because I would like to see more movies like this.","10","Josiah23"," As with most action movies made today, it carries the scent of loftier ambitions

"2985","Widowed Rancher and former U. S. Marine, Jim Hanson (Liam Neeson), operates a struggling ranch near the U. S./Mexico border dealing with financial pressures, unsatisfactory cattle yields, and illegal boarder traffic from drug cartels and struggling migrants that often leaves dead or wounded upon his land. When he comes across Rosa (Teresa Ruiz) and her son Miguel (Jacob Perez) on the run from a gang of cartel enforcers led by Mauricio (Juan Pablo Raba), Jim becomes their reluctant protector and stokes Mauricio's ire when he kills his brother in a shootout. With Rosa killed in the crossfire, Rosa makes a dying request of Jim to deliver Miguel to her cousin in Chicago in exchange for the cash in her possession and along the way elude the cartel enforcers and their connections.Released in 2021, The Marksman marks the second feature film collaboration between Liam Neeson and producer Mark Williams following their previous effort in Honest Thief (which Williams also directed). The Marksman is directed by Robert Lorenz, a frequent producing collaborator of Clint Eastwood having produced a number of Eastwood's directorial efforts since 2002 and even directing Eastwood in the baseball drama Trouble with the Curve. Lorenz is in familiar territory with Neeson playing a similar character to many of Eastwood's later era characters and even utilizing a neo western framework that Eastwood would fit right at home in. The movie is a lean and effective film with good performances and well-staged action sequences and well integrated western iconography into a contemporary setting, but viewers will note its familiarity and how it pales in comparison to other similar contemporary westerns.Liam Neeson is well cast as the weary gunfighter archetype who wiles away his remaining years on his ranch, even if the type has been well worn since the Alan Ladd days of Shane. Neeson plays the character with both the signature intensity and also quiet sadness and anger from his days as a soldier. It's a really strong performance and overcomes its familiarity. Jacob Perez is also quite good as the young boy Miguel and plays off well against Neeson. Juan Pablo Raba as Mauricio is also good as an antagonist who tries to kill our protagonists is effectively chilling and serves as a good counterpoint to Neeson playing the character not too dissimilar from how a bandit leader would be played in a classic western (complete with Mauricio's mocking name for Neeson's character Jim ""Marine Corps"").The movie's script is unfortunately where the film falters. The build-up of the relationship between Jim and Miguel which should be the crux of a film like this pales in comparison to contemporary films of a similar nature such as Logan or News of the World. While the two actors do give strong performances, the script doesn't have much in the way of relationship building moments that give much emotional or thematic weight to resonate with audiences. The movie also has some leaps in logic such as how Jim is able to free Miguel from Border Patrol's custody and extraneous plot elements such as Jim's stepdaughter played by Katheryn Winnick who doesn't add much to the film and could've easily been cut from the movie with no real impact.The Marksman is a serviceable action thriller thanks to strong performances, tight direction, and thrilling action scenes. The movie's familiar and leaps in logic in the opening act undermine some of the stronger points, and there's some extraneous elements that feel like they should've been removed to further develop our two leads and their relationship. The movie pales in comparison to other contemporary westerns such as No Country for Old Man or Taylor Sheridan's films such as Wind River or Hell or High Water, but as is, The Marksman is basic but effective action thriller that'll prove a suitable time killer for most.","6","IonicBreezeMachine"," A serviceable neo western with a good performance by Neeson that overcomes its predictable narrative and lack of emotional weight.

I reserve ratings 4 and below for movies that are technically incompetent or completely incoherent, which this movie is certainly is NOT.

"2994","Lets be honest, this is a VERY average movie. The story ain't bad, yet very clichÃ©, the acting is decent, the chemistry between Liam and the kid co-star is alright altough not great either, but the movie itself is a slow drag. Liam Neeson captured lightning in a bottle with Taken many years ago. Not to say he was not a great actor before, but peoples started to see him as a legit action movie star after that movie, yet he keep appearing in what are mostly slow dragged ""thrillers/drama"" these days sold like action movies ?Yes Liam is not really young anymore, i am not expecting full on fist fight goodness like a Scott Adkins flick, but they could certainly have him shoot more guns, have more stunts and car pursuits, exiting stuff that could be done easily with stunt doubles or respecting his age.This movie is VERY slow pace, there is a few action scenes but they are far in between, and altough the premise is mostly the 2 lead on the run of the cartel, there is never much tension.Yet despite all of this, it manage to just entertain you enough to not bore you. Mostly because Liam Neeson has a great presence, he is a recognizable name and like i said the chemistry with the kid is believable. But its obvious this is another ""chainmade"" scripts like the movie industry pull out a gazillion times each year that they feed to a ""big name"" to sell purchases/rentals and make a decent ammount of $. The surprising part is that this movie actually released in theatre as well. No idea if its because there ain't much movies right now due to Covid, but it has everything to be a low budget direct to VOD movie, the likes you see countless times from Nick Cage or Steven Seagal.Overall nothing much else to say, it filled one of my movie nights while being ""ok"" but i will certainly never watch it again.Oh and Katheryn Winnick fans... well she is barely in the movie at all and don't do much, so don't get your hopes too high.","5","destroyerwod"," Liam Neeson to sell/carry a generic VOD-style movie...

"2995","Dreadful 'action' movie, sorry Liam. At almost 2 hours long this really would have greatly benefited from a heavy cut in the editing room and brought down to a lean 75-80 minutes. The biggest issues with this movie is 1) lack of action apart from a few small sections in the movie. And 2) extremely drawn out. The bulk of the movie is Liam with a kid where the dialogue is equal to a highschool play.I got into bed at night thinking I'd have something decent to watch and instead just found myself fast forwarding these scenes just so I can get this movie over with. There's lots more that makes this movie sink in quicksand but that's the main of it. The stereotypical ""bad guy"", the extremely obvious clues and clueless mishaps that always keeps the baddies almost one step ahead and on and on.Do yourself a favor and save yourself and go watch Death WIsh (original) if you want an action movie.","3","meneermalik-1"," To call this an action/thriller is a big stretch!

"2999","Sometimes there's no accounting for taste, or explaining it. In spite of a steady and virulent stream of rather dismissive reviews, ""The Marksman"" has found its audience, and offers just enough to pass for a mindless time spender that doesn't feature CGI battles.Spoiler: Liam Neeson. There, it had to be said. Liam Neeson with a gun, to be more specific. A dusty, grizzled war veteran. A trusty dog. The evil Mexican drug cartel. A barb-wired border wall. A sack of money. A doe-eyed kid. An American flag waving in the desert wind. Everything is in its proper place.This is basically Clint Eastwood Mach II territory: a traditional senior caught up in today's young criminal thug world, using old school techniques to outsmart, outshoot and outpunch the stunned whipper snappers. And yet, it doesn't play by the set out cookie cutter pattern. The old coot never resorts to any macho posturing, instead he reluctantly slips into dangerous waters as circumstances dictate. It's a bit of an acting transformation for an actor who clearly owns some chops, but has been saddled with his current robotic action hero stereotype.The plot may be pedantic dumb, but who needs smart when Neeson is commanding the screen, and we have the classic good guy vs. The bad guys showdown with sides oh so easy to take.Next up: the comedy we all know thespian Liam has deep within his stone cold soul.hipCRANK.","6","js-66130"," BORDERLINE

"3019","I love Liam Nesson he works in action films great I enjoyed Taken 1-3, Unknown, The Grey, A Walk Among the Tombstones, Non-Stop, Run All Night, The Commuter, Cold Pursuit, Honest Thief now with this film it's less action in trailer it shows more action then to actual film not kidding at all, it's more in trailer and Less in actual film with less action film and more of a bland, road-trip style drama style on run. and yeah story is same topical thing Jim (Liam Nesson) A previous member of the Marine Corp Jim struggles with alcohol, and is unapologetically atheist, which I found interesting for a character in amainstream film, a Marksman expert. he was just driving aheading home and suddenly he found a boy Miguel and his mother Rosa, were on run after her brother told her to get out of dodge, one of cartels are after them because they know where the money is hidden, Rosa dies she tells Jim to take her son to Chicago to be safe Jim expected her offer he does it he accept it now he is on run to take Miguel and product him and take him to Chicago. they are on run to get away from cartels that wants Miguel. that's topical film as olden days now if you watch trailer and think oh it's action film full on 1 hour and 48 minutes well it's not, it has less action more of drama sadly I wished this film to be better I wanted what I wanted movie to be more action but trailer has more action then to actual film, that's what begged me for threw out film. I enjoyed Liam Nesson and kid Miguel Their scenes together were quite touching and they got to know each other the chemistry between those 2 were good. The script is good not greatest script but script is fine nothing is bad what Inotice. it's worth checking out if you love Liam Nesson in action or drama films this is worth it but when you watch it don't follow my opinion, make up your own mind if you like film, I liked it but at end of day it's time waster film not something I would want to watch everytime this film could been a Netflix film not an cinema release that's what I really wish for because it's not full on fun action it's drama-thriller bland film it's not bad film to watch I thought it was enjoyable for Liam Nesson and for film, when you see trailer don't expect for full on action like Taken and such it's more of thriller-drama their is action couple of scenes but not much until at 3rd act of film at final moment their is action scene that's it don't expect this to be action film.","5","nikola17"," it's nothing that special it's okay film for time waster

"3020","I saw ""The Marksman"", starring Liam Neeson-Honest Thief, The Dead Pool; Jacob Perez-Stop the Bleeding!_tv, Papa Bear; Katheryn Winnick-Big Sky_tv, Vikings_tv and Antonio Leyba-Sicario, Breaking Bad_tv.
This is a Liam Neeson action movie, only a Lite version. It's good but you can tell that Liam is getting a little tired and just might be getting too old-I think he is around 68-to be doing action movies. He plays a rancher that lives on the border of Arizona & Mexico-his wife died recently of cancer so he lives alone-and he sees a lot of people sneaking across the border. In fact, he has a walkie talkie that he calls the Border Patrol on whenever he spots any trespassers-they are even on a first name basis. Katheryn plays Liam's daughter that is in Law Enforcement herself. Liam comes across Jacob and his mother crossing over and so he calls his Border Buddies. But before they can show up, Liam runs into Antonio & his friends-who happen to be Mexican Cartel members-looking for Jacob & his mother. The mother doesn't survive the encounter but she does make Liam promise to take Jacob to some relatives in Chicago. From there, the chase is on. Can Liam outrun the Cartel and make it to Chicago, without spreading too much carnage and dead bodies along the way?
It's not a bad movie but it's no 'Taken'.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, bloody images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.
I enjoyed it enough that I would probably buy it on DVD.","7","stevendbeard"," Liam Lite

"3021","One of the worst Liam Neeson movies! What a monstrous disappointment. It's a shame that he had to make this film.

"3022","Liam Neeson has been in some great movies but the last couple of years he has been in the B movies list as well,but that doesn't mean its a bad movie.The story is fairly straightforward without any surprises.Its predictable but a nice story nonetheless.Some people say Liam Neeson is falling into the same category as Nicholas Cage but he has been in some awful movies.This movie isn't anything special but Liam Neeson makes it entertaining.I had a good time watching it, just don't expect an action driven Taken kind of movie.Its more like a drama with some acrion elements in it.Don't listen to people who give this a really bad review, it won't win any oscars but its still a good enough movie to watch.This.","7","marcvuijk"," Liam Neeson B movie, not necessarily a bad thing!!

"3028","I'm not from the US, so I am not familiar with the border security challenges faced on the US/Mexico border.And while this movie isn't about border security, if it represents even a small percentage of truth on what was shown on how seemingly easy it was for people to cross the border between the US & Mexico. I'm now beginning to understand why so many people in the US are demanding for a wall to be built.As for the movie itself, it's another Neeson style movie where he's on a mission. The difference,...this time he's the one being hunted, rather than doing the hunting. The movie showed enough pace to keep me somewhat interested. But it also frustrated me on how (sometimes) clueless and bad luck Neeson's character was having, which kept providing enough clues for the bad guys to continually track where he's heading.I guess if it weren't for these blunders, the movie would be less dramatic.SUMMARY:
It's a Neeson movie. A man on a mission for a worthy cause.VERDICT:
It's worth a watch on a boring rainy day.","5","Hammer-Rocks"," No wonder people are crying for a wall

"3031","How did Liam Neeson go from Schindler's List to this?Sure, you do some bad movies for a paycheck, but usually he at least acts like he cares in his movies. In this film he just went on autopilot after the opening scene, and the other actors look like they're completely asleep. Out of all the auxiliary characters, the kid's mother, the girl at the gas station and the main villain's driver emote the most. Those are barely even speaking roles.It's hard to even call this a movie, since there is barely any plot to the whole thing. Most of the setups go nowhere. Neeson's relationship to his cop friend ends up being pointless filler, his house is burned down after he already chose to leave, he loses his rifle at one scene only to immediately buy another in a scene later. Hardly anything in the film is of consequence. It's basically Neeson and the kid, who share absolutely no chemistry, on a bland road trip and the bad guys slowly gaining on them, because they track his credit card usage.There is no ticking clock element, no hard choices to make by any of the characters, nothing of consequence. Add to this the fact that the film has barely any score and only two action scenes, one of which consists of guys walking slowly before being shot through a scope - off screen.The film feels like it's trying to make a point about the border, but I can't even make out what it is. Farmers shouldn't report illegals, because the cartels may be after them? But at the same time the official border checkpoints are corrupt and the cartels just pass through? Buying an unregistered gun is good? All of these scenes felt tacked on and again have no bearing on the main plot.Rarely have I seen a script with so little thought put into it. This is a Nicholas Cage / Bruce Willis level bad film. I really hope Liam Neeson's next project will be better than this. This is the latest and by far the worst in a string of stinkers.","2","kuner-59029"," Slow, uninspired and banal

What's wrong with it, you may ask. Well, first of - they are running the whole time with his old Chevy, which is known to killers from the beginning! Althoug he has cash and some time and advantage, he doesn't get idea of changing his well known vehicle!? And there's a scene when they (marine and boy) are happyly burning ""blood money"". Would you burn (with smile) your last money when you are running, hiding and fighting for your life? Also, dialogues are full of cliches and stupidity and everything is so predictable till the end.

Who, if any would do that.And with bad guys chasing you, maybe it would be an idea to change car? Or not leaving tracks with a credit card when you have a whole bag of cash?If you manage to ignore the stupid, easy choices the director uses it's viewable, but it'll certainly leave you thinking that Liam Neeson is walking in Nicholas Cage's footprints; A-B- and worse it gets...","5","bjornar-182-260351"," Roadtrip movie with a hint of action

Rosa is hit and dies leaving Jim to care for Miguel to take him to his family in Chicago. The Cartel wants the money that Miguel's uncle Carlos (Alfredo Quiroz) stole and gave to Rosa.The rest of the movie is Jim and Miguel on the road to Chicago. Maurico and his men monitor their path all along the way. Jim constantly makes the mistake of using his credit card and the Cartel people are watching for this to see where Jim and Miguel are. Jim and Miguel learn to trust each other.Notables: Katheryn Winnick as Sarah, a Border Patrol Agent who constantly tries to help Jim; Dylan Kenin as Randall, one of Maurico's men; Charles David Richards as the gun store owner who Jim buys guns from: Vic Browder as the Trooper who stops Jim and waits for Maurico and his men; Tommy Lafitte as the Minister who says comforting words to Miguel for Rosa his mother.A very pretty Katheryn Winnick is a master in all kinds of Martial Arts disciplines (check her out on Wikipedia), but her role here is kind of limited and she doesn't do any martial arts. And, yes, Liam Neeson's ""skills"" aren't fully shown in here as we are used to seeing in other movies.

"3041","""The Marksman"" has the promise of being a good film, however then you realise its got Liam Neeson staring, its an action film and its being released in January (a notorious dumping ground for nothing but quality product lol) The funny thing is I think I've seen this film a million times, well at least a version of it. It is one of the most stereotypical, dull, boring, re-treads about the US Mexican order and the cartels. This film doesn't really offer anything new to that very unique genre and trust me there are so many better films than this one.The only thing saving this film is Liam Neeson, without him this would be a horrifying disaster. There is an attempt to create a relationship with his character and the little kid but its just boring. I just hope this is the last time I see Mr Neeson in an action film being the prominent star. That time has past now, please move on and go back to being involved in some great drama or some ensemble films. I still think he is a terrific actor however these days he is coasting along staring in B-rate action films. There was also an attempt to build development between him and a cop but that failed as well.Overall its 45% out of 100 or 4.5 out of 10. Its a really poor attempt at the cartel genre along the Mexican/US border. Dull writing, boring story......so basic and nothing new whatsoever. It is only saved because Liam Neeson is a great actor and is someone I enjoy watching other than that don't waste your time with this one.","4","Lewis_Heather787"," This film offers nothing new !

"
"3047","At first I didn't really think too much of this film, namely because it was certainly not what you would expect from Liam Neeson. Normally, such a film would have him single handedly take down an entire Mexican drug cartel because, well, he's Liam Neeson and he does things like that. However, this isn't that type of film. In fact I found that it was rather slow and dull. That is until you sit down and think about what they are trying to get across.So, Neeson happens to be a rancher, and an ex-Marine, and he spends his days dealing with Coyotes and reporting illegal aliens that have made their way through the wall (or should I say fence). Anyway, one day he encounters a woman and her child, and as he prepares to take them to the border patrol, some cartel members rock up, and a shootout begins. Neeson then realises that he simply cannot send the boy back, so decides to take him to Chicago.I guess there are two takeaway things from this film, the main one being that many of us really don't understand why it is that people are attempting to enter the United States. There are cases that it is a life and death event, though the suggestion is that while the kid might not be killed, he would certainly not be going back to the world that he once knew - instead he would no doubt end up being another foot soldier for the Mexican cartels.Another thing is the suggestion that the cartels have a lot more influence than is made out. Just because they are based in Mexico does not mean that they have influences, and bases, in the United States. Nor does it mean that the guards along the border are all that pure either, and act to prevent them from entering the US. In fact the suggestion is that the reach of the Cartels, and the ability of many of the soldiers to get into the US is much easier than is realised (and this has been explored in other films as well).Another interesting thing is that Neeson's wife died of cancer, and while it isn't a big thing, it is another subtle thing that exists in the background. It follows the idea of 'don't get sick in America', meaning that a sick family member can easily bankrupt quite a lot of people. This is the situation that Neeson has found himself in, particularly since his farm is on the verge of being repossessed.Okay, it does have something thought provoking aspects to it, but still, I did find that the film was a little slow, and a part of me would have preferred the old style Neeson action flick where he basically single handedly takes out an entire cartel.","5","The-Sarkologist"," Slow and Dragiing

"3051","The Marksman is a gripping movie, and not only in the ways the genre expects of it. Sure, it is suspenseful and exciting, but it also grabs the audience in emotional ways that are completely unexpected and that take this thriller to the next level. Too often ""action"" movies are so concerned with the suspense and thrill of it that they forget to put the same energy-if not more-into the story and the characters. But The Marksman knows that emotion is the key to genuine suspense. If we have an emotional connection to these characters, we will care what happens to them. The movie uses that to its advantage, and really successfully. The action truly means something here-the stakes feel real, and they feel personal.But it's not just the action or the life-or-death stakes that pack the punches. It's the quieter moments. The acting really sells these smaller scenes. Liam Neeson's work is so subtle, and yet he conveys so much emotion that it's clear exactly what he's thinking and feeling in every scene-even if it's just a small heartbreaking moment by himself (and there are many).Overall, The Marksman provides a captivating experience for the audience in more ways than the average viewer might expect-be prepared to get emotional. (I might also suggest having a palate-cleansing comedy lined up for afterward.)","10","arklein328"," Gripping and Emotional

The action is certainly there but it doesn't form the core of The Marksman. I'd say it's more of a character-driven drama with elements of a road thriller. Strictly speaking, it's standard Liam Neeson fare where only his character undergoes an emotional transition. Nothing, I mean absolutely nothing else really counts here. Is it still watchable? For sure, as is the case with most Liam Neeson flicks. If you've seen any of his work in the last decade, you've seen it all. Only names, settings, and situations change. Also, they really need to stop writing scenes with Neeson on the phone. That's an oversaturated niche in itself.","4","arungeorge13"," More of the same from Liam Neeson! [+42%]

"3076","Very solid. That's probably the best way to describe this movie. The story gives you exactly what you expect from it, but nothing more. Liam Neeson is by far the best part of this movie. He's character is very interesting, and I would have loved to see a lot more from his past. Now we just get a rightful man that tries to do a good thing for this boy. The boy also gives a solid performance and their chemistry makes the predictable story a lot better. The only thing that really bothered me was the antagonist. His original goal doesn't really make sense. He gets way too much screen time for such an uninteresting character and would have worked just as well with half of the scenes. The main problem however, is that there is nothing new. Everything in this movie is something we've seen before in one shape or another. The movie doesn't try to bring anything new to the genre and that makes it very predictable and even at times a bit boring. There aren't really any big issues with it, but there absolutely that is memorable. Is it the worst thing? No, but it is something maybe even worse, forgettable.","5","joostkale"," Forgettable

The writers just decide randomly to make the dog approach the cartel men alone. Either way a stupid death, the dog did not deserve that and it wasnt a meaningful death either. The action scenes were a disappointment, except for only one scene where neeson makes a car flip over. The movie is slow and boring and the ending is the cherry on top, with liam neeson basically dying (tho wikipedia says ""unconscious"" but stupid nonetheless how he didnt even call 911 right away and go to the hospital. Its unrealistic that the mexican cartel would have its hands on every police/hospital in the U. S. and he couldhv easily gotten help right after the ""big fight"" at the end.) besides, if the cartel is so powerful with its hands stretched out so wide then how does he know its safe for miguel once he is with his aunt in chicago?? Cant the cartel easily find him there if they are that determined to find miguel? I guess since the boss guy died theres less danger of that, but this movie had poor writing nonetheless.

"3095","""The Marksman"" (2021 release; 108 min.) brings the story of retired Marine Jim Hanson. As the film opens, a Mexican drug cartel is hot on the heels of Carlos, who calls his family that they need to flee the house. We fo to ""Naco, Arizona"", where Hanson shoots a wolf from long distance. Upon returning to his ranch, he is served eviction papers by the bank for being 6 months late in his mortgage payments. We go to ""the US/Mexico Border, Monday"", and as Hanson is driving his truck, a young boy and his mom are crossing the border just as the cartel arrives on the scene and demand their return. Hanson refuses... At this point we are 10 min. into the film but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from Oscar-nominated producer Robert Lorenz (""American Sniper"", :Letters From Iwo Jima""), but only his second movie directing. Here he brings the latest action hero vehicle for Liam Neeson. Nesson, bless his heart, give his all but even he cannot save the weak script that he has been dealt. The entire film is so utterly predicable from the get-go, and feels like it's done strictly by the numbers. Liam Neeson takes on the Mexican drug cartel all by himself. Truly a one man army against the might of the Mexican drug cartel. I wonder who will win that battle... Don't you wonder also? This film is from the same production house that just 4 months ago released the previous Neesom action flick ""Honest Thief"". In fact these Neesom films are coming at us so fast and furious, they now seems to blend in from one to the next. And yet, I and many others kep turning up. Why? Because Neesom is really good at this, for one, and it is like comfort food (comfort film?) in difficult times. Reason I still rate 3 stars when all is said and done.""The Marksman"" opened in theaters in mid-January and I just saw it this past weekend (2ne week of release). The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at was attended okay (about 10 people, which is above average as COVID-19 continues to rage from coast to coast). If you are in the mood for another serving of Liam Neesom as action film hero and ready to save the world, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventuallay on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","5","paul-allaer"," Liam Neesom vs. the Mexican drug cartel: and the winner is...

"3097","The Marksman is a slower-paced action film set on the road from Texas to Chicago. The film stars Liam Neeson as Jim, a retiree who's seen better days. There is a strong action storyline but those expecting a shoot-em-up adrenaline rush may want to look elsewhere.Jim's wife has passed away, his finances gutted by the cost of her medical bills, and his decaying ranch adjoining the border to Mexico is under threat since he can't keep up with his rent. Now all he's got is his loyal canine companion and a few days left with his property. On a drive surveying his land, Jim finds a boy named Miguel and his mother Rosa, crossing the border. Members of a drug cartel are hot on their trail, eager to capture the mother and son. A shootout between Jim and their pursuers occurs and Rosa is mortally wounded. As she passes away, Jim makes a promise to get Miguel to their family in Chicago where he'll be safe.The Marksman is a conundrum as an action movie - as for action, it's sparse, save for a few shootouts here and there where Neeson's character gets a chance to live up to his Marksman moniker. When you hear Liam Neeson and action movie within the same breath, you picture Neeson defiantly doling out revenge to those who have wronged him and the people he cares about, which to some extent is what The Marksman becomes. But it plods along its course, steeping you in the everyday life of Neesons' Jim, before putting into perspective the predicament Miguel faces from the cartel members who killed his mother.Jim's encounters with the cartel is only mildly suspenseful. So much of the The Marksman doesn't fully develop Miguel and Jim's dynamic, either. These characters spend so much time together, but, by the end, they only manage to get each other where they need to go, and nothing more. There's humanity, but there's no spark to it. I don't fault the performances, as much as I do a script with not enough meaningful moments for the central pair's bond to supplant itself deeply in the fabric of the movie.I give The Marksman 2 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18 for some mild violence and the killing of a dog.

The stubborn decision to kill the boy by those Mexican drug gang members is also a bit weak scenario for just a bag of US$ which only showed once when the old rancher opened the bloody purse, it only showed some paper money in $20s instead of $100s, there's no strong incentive to invest so many gang members to chase a boy with so few dollars.Nelson, as always, performed a decent role in this somewhat lame and slow paced no-brainer. The story line is just too loose and without energy to drag on and on so long. By using this kind of ""old man's formula"", an older rancher lived by the border crap should be call for an end from now on, no sense to reproduce or to remake again and again. Once for all and once is more than enough.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","MovieIQTest"," An overly cliched ""No Country for Old Man"" formula

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed can't even be tried in a court of law because he was tortured during his questioning and subsequent confessions thus making them inadmissible in a court of law, at least in a U.S. court--and we know he was guilty. The entire idea of American justice and human rights was completely compromised because of the George Bush administration's need to ""punish"" someone, anyone for the attacks of 9/11 (not to mention that they waged two failed wars).What sort of sub-human animal would torture another human being? We did that, our country did that. Perhaps this film will educate a few people to this indisputable reality. We tortured prisoners in Iraq at Abu Graib, at other black sites around the world, and at the Guantanamo Detention Center. This is a fact. The Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld signed off on the plan to torture prisoners held in U.S. custody.The film never completely exonerates Slahi who went on to publish his memoir and become world famous. Nice job, Rumsfeld. The people we held and currently hold in Guantanamo represent no existential threat to the security of the United States. We need to either try them or release them. They aren't criminal masterminds, these people aren't scientists creating some new and horrible weapon to destroy us, they are simply religious fanatics dedicated to their insane causes.

"3105","IN BRIEF: Very good acting enhances this true story about injustice.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) Mohamedou Ould Slahi (Tahar Rahim) stands accused of terrorism and defense attorney Nancy Hollander (Jodie Foster) and her associate Teri Duncan (Shailene Woodley) fight for his freedom in Kevin McDonald's impassioned but slightly flawed film, The Mauritanian. After being detained and imprisoned without charges in Guantánamo Bay Priso by the U.S. government for years, their case and cover-up finally goes to trial with some surprising turns of events.The Mauritanian is based on a true story and director Kevin McDonald skillfully depicts a series of chain events that led to Slahi's capture and imprisonment. The screenplay by M.B. Traven, Rory Haines, and Sohrab Noshirvani has some compelling dialog and strong conformational set pieces, but it is a tad choppy with out-of-sequence flashbacks providing his backstory. These scenes tend to slow down the film's pacing and serve more as sub-plot than needed exposition. Whenever the film stays focused on the investigation and its legal maneuverings, the movie excels with its two standout performances by the lead actors.Mr. Rahim is excellent in his well-written part. We watch his strength and disillusion shift and he delivers a harrowing portrayal of man tortured and accused. Ms. Foster is commanding in her no-nonsense role as his crusader, a woman more concerned with the law than her client's morality. Their attorney/client moments together are superb and help to build interest in this legal drama. Both are worthy of award consideration.Some of the supporting characters, while well acted by Shailene Woodley, Zachary Lev, and Benedict Cumberbatch as the prosecuting lawyer, seem stereotypical products of that era of terrorist activities and national paranoia: the gung-ho military soldiers, the liberal-minded defense attorneys, the innocent or not so-innocent client,, the questioning prosecutor, etc. But the basic scenario of injustice rings true and gives moviegoers a gripping drama.Director Mr. McDonald does not shy away from the intense scenes of sound deprivation sexual humiliation, and waterboarding techniques which were a part of his stay there. (The film is not for the squeamish.) To the filmmaker's credit, he also never confirms Slahi's guilt or innocence of the criminal accusations, although he does place the blame for his illegal confinement solely with the US Government. One wishes the film contained more courtroom scenes than investigative ones. This could have shed more light on the case and its characters.The Mauritanian is a strong cinematic plea for tolerance and justice to prevail in our legal system. It is an important film worth viewing.","8","jadepietro"," The Good Fight

The scenes in the prison are exceptionally well realized.One flaw is that Shailene Woodley's character, the junior lawyer, is poorly drawn, is present before dropping from sight until the end, and doesn't give Shailene much of a chance to do anything with the role.","9","richard-1967"," Taut true tale well told and acted

Everything about it is off, there is nothing scary or suspenseful, the gore is bland, it's obvious that the film makers have no clue as to how to film horror. At times it was bad in a campy way that had me laughing, a bad sign while watching a horror/thriller. To top it off Vadhir Derbez , the real lead, has to be one of the most dreary actors ever. Either he was given poor direction on how to play his part or he's just naturally an awful actor. The plot is filled with holes, a certain twist I guessed early on, the writing is lazy, scenes that could have worked with some build-up had none and worst of all I struggled to stay awake. This is even below the standards of television and many low-budget exorcism movies. Poor Guy, he tried, but even he couldn't save this.","2","hampersnow-28905"," Poor Guy Pearce

"3127","I agree with the other reviewers- this film had no energy, a cliche plot, and the co-lead (Father Daniel) was awful. I was looking forward to this film and it was a let down. In the over-saturated genre of exorcism movies, there is nothing to make this movie stand apart from the others.The only slight redeeming factor in this was Guy Pierce, and even he wasn't that good.Not worth a watch[4/10]","4","ryan_sy"," It Took Me Seven Days to Finish This!

"3128","While the subject has been explored in other movies, the Rite of Exorcism is, by itself, a very complex theme to reproduce. Some might call this movie a cliché or a waste of time, but it goes through another route altogether. It's not the ""goes to the house exorcise demons"" routine. If it could have been better handled? Yes, it could. There's some loose ends to the story. However, I did find it refreshing. Above all, never watch a movie with high expectations. No matter the subject, take it for what it is: Entertainment.","6","Shark_Stark"," Not your common exorcism movie

A great actor with such bad character and lines, why, oh why? Unbearable. If he's massacred, you would at least expect a decent protagonist but you just get a handsome guy with zero acting skills, having the exactly same face for 1,5 hours.And finally please remove this movie from the horror section.

The possessed kid is even worse. I've heard better sounding demon voices on my 80s heavy metal records. Certain events take place in front of multiple people, and the main characters proceed to the next scene without anyone saying anything. They give away the twist 15 minutes before it happens. The twist is boring. The final showdown is uninspired weak-sauce. And then the movie ends with a set-up like it's the first episode of some cheap new streaming series. Oh, and the worse thing is that Keith David is in this movie, and they completely waste his potential. The man is a legend and deserves better. So does the audience.There is no excuse for this movie. If people keep paying for this nonsense, the studios will keep making it. If you've never seen an exorcism movie, please don't start with this one. If you like them, please don't waste your time with this one.I'll try to say something positive. There was one scene involving a hallway with a strobing effect that looked pretty cool.

"3159","Well, as I sat down to watch the 2021 horror mystery ""The Seventh Day"" I must admit that two thoughts went through my head. The first thought was with a cast that included both Guy Pearce and Stephen Lang then of course I would be in for a good movie. And my second thought were this will probably be yet another dubious exorcism movie.Yet, I still opted to sit down to watch ""The Seventh Day"" from writer and director Justin P. Lange. And yes, ""The Seventh Day"" was certainly watchable, but that was about it. It was not an overly great movie, despite of having a nice enough twist to the storyline.Nay, the movie just suffered from being a bit too monotonous. There wasn't enough pacing to the storyline and what did happen throughout the course of the movie just felt somewhat generic and not overly interesting. And that, ultimately, made ""The Seventh Day"" into a less than mediocre movie experience. Sure, there were aspects of the storyline that proved to have potential, but writer and director Justin P. Lange just didn't fully cash in on these and take full advantage of the material readily at hand.""The Seventh Day"" felt monotonous and sort of lulled me into a dull sense of stupor, as there wasn't a whole lot of things going on throughout the course of the movie. Yet, I managed to endure this to the very end. But, alas, I wasn't overly impressed or overly entertained by what transpired.The acting performances in the movie were okay. Sure, I had expected more from Guy Pearce, but Stephen Lang was hardly in the movie at all, which actually was a shame.All in all, then ""The Seventh Day"" is not a movie that enrichen the horror genre, nor is it a particularly outstanding foray into the demonic possession and exorcism subgenres. The things that transpire in this movie is basically something that has been seen and done in other movies, more often than not, also done better in other movies. So this is not a revolutionary movie in any way.My rating of ""The Seventh Day"" lands on a four out of ten stars, as it was somewhat of a disappointing movie.","4","paul_haakonsen"," Don't expect too much from this generic exorcism movie...

You get a bit of his backstory as to why he does what he does, and he has to mentor the somewhat nervy Fr Daniel, thrown into the world of aggressive exorcisms.There are a few good moments in the movie, and without spoiling it, the ending you could see coming about 2/3rds of the way through, but it still entertained me.I think with a bit of polish on the script, this could have been a lot better, but I give it an 8 as I enjoyed it, and in today's bland movie scene thanks to Covid, this did take me away from everything for 90 minutes.","8","roverite1970-682-875506"," Not for everyone, but I actually enjoyed this cheesy film

"3177","Of religious catholic horror from the late 70's and 80's, just a cheesy try, where the elements of fear does work, and follows the film ''omen I'''s footsteps. For a vast new generation that has grown up with stupid kids on the cabin trips, and halloweenique scream factoricing thematics, where the loonies and serial killers are the carrier of evil, this film brings forward the holy shrines of christianity, namely the holy mother of jesus, mary. There hasnt been made great titles over the trinity lately so it may start a new wave of its kind.I do think this film has a cold driving down thy spine if youll let it, the acting is what the direction and screenplay allows, some of the cataclysmic effects in the final sequence though gives a cheesy smell of budget limitations, and the flame-bouyant visual effects, and the hissing and clicking sound effects lacks originality. Scarejumps youll get, and the feel of icecold uncertainty will challenge even the biggest disbeievers on the skid row to hell.So my recommendation must be to have a try, i think youll catch the bait at some point, the premisses are all there, its just not used brilliantly enough thinks the grumpy old man.

"3186","While The Unholy is DEFINITELY not a 10 or a 9... it ALSO isn't a 1 or a 2 (even a 3). First half of the movie feels like a different flick than the second half. First half sets things up and it's creepy and exactly what you'd expect. Second half, feels like a rush to the finish line. Almost like two different directors made this movie.I think people that are genuine and gave the movie a low score... likely had an issue with the script and pacing. However, it's definitely a fairly original take on the classic horror genre (demonic/possession). I'll admit, I'm a bit of a sucker for horror movies based around religion as generally they seem to be more interesting to me.That all said, I think the cast was good. Jeffrey Dean Morgan, William Sadler, Cary Elwes and Cricket Brown were all great. Cricket Brown was especially impressive because I believe this movie is one of her first larger productions and she gives the impression of being a pro in this department. At times, it felt like the cast was not as connected to the movie as they could be. Of course, the movie didn't feel connected to itself after 52 minutes and goes wildly into warp speed conclusions.Directing and Editing were just OK and could have been better IMO.. The script however could use some work. Even though the story felt like one we've seen a million times, I liked the premise and overall theme but the movie veers off and hits walls, then takes off at full speed before veering off into more walls. It provides the conclusions verses letting the audience figure them out. First half of the movie does a good setup job for the characters and direction. Second half of the movie ignores the setup, ignores the characters and goes straight to the source of the problems. It's like they spent a year recording the first half and a month on the second.Overall, not a bad movie. Entertaining for at least half the movie. Good premise. Good acting. Great new acting with Cricket Brown. But, hits a wall halfway through and never recovers. Solid 6 IMO due to acting and overall theme.","6","cmhouser"," Not a 10 and not a 2... see the forest through the trees

"3198","The #1 reason I come to imdb is because they show the viewer review ratings first, not the critic rating which cuts down good movies that don't adhere to the critic's checklist.This movie is a prime example of one such movie. It ACTUALLY has a good plot and leans on the plot much more than it does on cheap scares (of which there are a few).Anybody that appreciates the telling of a story in a movie which builds suspends and reveals details as the film progresses won't be disappointed. I found myself watching wanting to know how it ends and was hooked in until the end.My real rating for this movie is a 7.5/10 but I gave it a few extra points to bring up the low rating others have given it.Ps: The reason for a few of the low ratings is that they really could've done without the cheap cgi and some bits they put in there just because they felt they should, but they really didn't need to. For people who were expecting a lot of horror and gore and action, of which I'm sure there were a few, were probably disappointed as they didn't care for a story or a little depth and a very relevant message that isn't brought up much.If you are even mildly interested in the old spooky tales in little towns and like a good story being told, go ahead and take a chance at this unholy. Even as I sat and watched it, it's been better than most of the movies I've seen at the cinemas the past few months.","10","gpx_fto"," Actually had a good plot + Good message

"3204","This is actually about the power of faith and the battle for the souls of people. That's not what critics go for, and they punish art that tackles the issue for being so out of touch with what critics know is more important. So I thought somebody should include a mention of how well the film presents this, as contrasted with the usual horror blah about how stupid people truly are and how scary gore can be. IF the deeper story is for you, then you might agree with me that this movie is a worthwhile 6 to 7 in the horror genre. And I say 7 because I don't mind the indifferent horror effects (the fewer the better, imho), which some may legitimately mind a lot, I guess, and I credit the extra point entirely to the complex and understated portrayal of the main character by Morgan in the lead.","7","peoplepower-588-227356"," Better than the critics say because...

"3208","I found this movie to be solidly enjoyable overall. I wouldn't say that it was groundbreaking compared to the average horror move, but there were a couple of things that make it stand out as a fun and interesting watch.The first is the mixture of humour alongside the more fearful and suspenseful elements. This is one of the best things about Sam Raimi's movies-- there is often a surprising blend of fun and darkness in the tone.The second strength of the movie is its focus on the theme of cult mentalities. I liked that it dealt with this topic in a fairly believable fashion that emphasized the human elements of cult dynamics.Ultimately, I got the sense that the movie wasn't trying to take itself too seriously. It provides a reasonably satisfying story and set of character arcs, with some fun scares along the way. As long as a viewer isn't going into the movie and expecting total seriousness, then the movie should make for pretty entertaining viewing.","8","macgand"," Decently Entertaining Horror Film

But after witnessing the subject talk dirty, rearrange the furniture, air people's dirty laundry and show off their amazing contortionist skills, said lapsed/skeptic priest becomes a true believer) but I actually enjoyed this movie. One surprise was the injection of humor. The other is that none of the events took place in a dark dungeon or on a dark and stormy night. Third, even though the cast was full of unknowns (except the parish priest, who I've seen in other films), the acting was thoroughly natural and believable enough to keep me engaged. The main characters truly developed and evolved throughout the film. Finally the movie, while never claiming to be anything other than fiction, nevertheless contained a valuable message.

"3213","I heard negative reviews from other horror fans about this film before I went to go see it, but I ended up liking it. It is an adequate, decent horror film for today. Some parts of the film were cheesy and not convincing, but Jeffrey Dean Morgan delivers a convincing performance as a disgraced journalist trying to repair his reputation and seeking redemption in a young girl who suddenly becomes a saint in her community by being able to heal the incurable sick by powers gifted to her by the ""Virgin Mary"".The film's tactics work on cheap scares and scary art imagery; however, its plot remains interesting enough for horror fans to want to know more.

"3215","I'd heard terrible reviews about this going in, but I was certainly in for a pleasant surprise. While the movie does have a few rather predictable scenes, they're mingled with unexpected twists, immensely effective jump scares, and excellent character development. While a few minor characters' acting may be a bit sub-par (which is never the fault of the top billed cast, of course), the raw intensity of Jeffrey Dean Morgan's character more than makes up for it. The CGI doesn't look the best at first, since the initial scene that uses it is in a dream sequence, but after that, it is so realistic that you can scarcely tell that it wasn't done with live actors (it does, however, have an effect around it which serves to make it even more unnatural, which some may find to look bad). A fantastic cast, wonderful direction, great writing, and a terrifying antagonist all work in tandem to make this movie the best horror film I've seen since The Empty Man. It's entertaining, easy to follow, and, to be perfectly honest, I don't remember the last time that an entire (socially distanced) theater full of people all jumped and screamed at the exact same time at an unexpected jumpscare. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. You'll love it.","10","haydengaun"," One of the best new horror movies of the last decade!

First time ever I walked out on a movie and I've seen some bad movies but this one was so full of religious clichÃ©s and horror clichÃ©s it was like some high schooler looked at a ""how to write a horror religious movie"" and just did it word for word. I mean the big character is supposed to bet he girl that is supposed to be deaf and mute but within five minutes of the movie she is already talking so you can't even get invested in her. Then she just talks so much. Then you have the main guy that was supposed to be disgraced for writing some fake story that you never find out what its about and now he's this hot shot. I don't know maybe something happened at the end.I mean there is nothing about the characters that make you want to root for them, see them succeed, see them do anything. And the jump scares are all there. Every single one. I did rate it 2 stars though because there was one jump that made me jump. So there is at least that but other than that you'd be better off skipping this for anything else. I had low expectations but it even fell way below those expectations.

"3219","The Unholy
2021
15
Director: Evan Spiliotopoulous
Starring: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Cricket Brown, William Sadler, Cary Elwes, Katie Aselton, Christine Adams, Diogo Morgado etcOverall rating 67/100The unholy is about a hearing-impaired girl who is visited by the virgin Mary and can suddenly hear, speak, and heal the sick. As people flock to witness her miracles, terrifying events unfold. Are they the work of Virgin Mary or something more sinister.The unholy was pretty good but had the potential to be so much better. The opening was very effective in setting up the tone of the film. The cinematography was excellent, I liked the clever links with previous scenes. The creature designs were pretty good. The main characters were pretty interesting, and their connection and chemistry was strong. I liked the balance to the main conflict of the film. The main character was very likeable. Towards the second half of the film the jumpscares were very effective and the scenes were very tense. I liked the development of the plot, the clever links to the flashback which pieced the film together well, and the final act was scary and entertaining.However, it was fairly generic. There was predictable and frustrating character decisions. There was a lot of lapses in the logic with some scenes. The editing was very poor in places, making it feel very choppy and unprofessional at times. There was way to much exposition with the main character. The pacing was fairly slow, with too many filler conversations. The film took a while to find its feet and actually get scary. There was also a lack of character depth, some scenes were very repetitive, and I thought the ending was terrible.So overall, The unholy is a fairly effective horror, with interesting themes, with good tension and jumpscares. And the cast did a pretty good job with what they had. But the film had the potential to be so much more, and got too caught up in its own mistakes that it came across as cheap and poorly done.","6","rnixon-15663"," The Unholy

The camera angles shown here i havent seen in a long time and change the whole prespective of the movie.

"3232","This was a movie that I actually have to thank Kate Pollack for turning me on to. We were chatting on a post about sub-genres we enjoy and she asked if I planned to see this. I don't watch trailers, but I did look into this and it peaked my interest. Jaime decided to see it with me as well when we went to a local theater. The synopsis here is a hearing-impaired girl is visited by the Virgin Mary and can suddenly hear, speak and heal the sick. As people flock to witness her miracles, terrifying events unfold.We start this movie off back in 1845. We are seeing a point of view of a woman being executed for being a witch. The mask of Satan is nailed to her face, she is hung from a tree and set on fire. What I found interesting here is that we never move away from this and it is quite horrific what happens to her. The last thing is that the man in charge holds up a doll that is wrapped in a chain to prevent her from coming back.The movie then takes us to Gerry Fenn (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). His editor wants him to investigate a lead about a cow in New England that has a mark on it. Gerry is reluctant, but we see he is on hard times. What we will learn later was that he was one of the top journalists in the world, but he was fabricating stories and was caught. The lead he follows turns out to be nothing. Something catches his eye by an odd, old tree and it is a doll. The farmer states it is a corn baby for luck. Gerry notices it has the impossible date of February 31st, 1845 on it. To help beef up his story, he breaks the head of the doll and takes pictures of it.That night as Gerry heads home, he almost hits a woman in the road. This causes him to crash and he gets out seeing what happened. The young woman is Alice (Cricket Brown). He follows her through the woods to the tree from earlier. He hears her whispering to it and touches her shoulder. She is taken to the local doctor of Natalie Gates (Katie Aselton). She is irate with Gerry and warns him if anything happens to the young woman, she will see he's put in jail.Gerry stays the night and the next day goes to church. Alice is an orphan and stays there as Father Hagan (William Sadler) is her uncle. Alice is also a deaf/mute, but Gerry thinks he heard her talk. Something amazing happens. Alice is hearing something and it causes her to stand up in the middle of Father Hagan's sermon. She goes outside to the tree and all of a sudden, she starts talking. She says that the Virgin Mary has spoken with her. That she has healed her and that they should all pledge their faith to her. Alice the next day also feels a little boy with muscular dystrophy.As word gets around, Bishop Gyles (Cary Elwes) and Monsignor Delgarde (Diogo Morgado) are called in to prove the validity of the miracle. Gerry also befriends Alice and obtains exclusive rights to report on this. This seems to be a shot at redemption for his career. The problem though, is the entity speaking and helping Alice really the Virgin Mary? Or is it something much more sinister?Where I want to start with my analysis here is that I should lead off stating this is one of my favorite sub-genres of film. It is interesting as I'm not religious, but religion does fascinate me and even more so with the conventions that this movie is using with it.Since this movie is starting off with the execution of the witch, I will start there. We get quite a bit of films on either side here where they are actually killing a witch or doing it in error of a more barbaric time. This could be considered a spoiler, but Mary Elnor (Marian Mazepa) is actually a witch. She did have a pact with the devil. I do like that there are records in this movie to help fill in this back-story. Going along with this, I do have a minor gripe that the mask of Satan wasn't removed, as it is something that is supposed to limit them. It does make for cool images so I get why keeping it until a reveal later. There are also hand drawn images of popular things that will pop up regularly in movies like this.Where I want to shift to next would be Gerry. He was on top of the world in his profession, but we learn as it goes on, he did some corrupt things to stay there. I like that he is capitalizing on what is in front of him. He is greedy and prideful. He is also the reason that everything happens in this movie as well. I do believe he would do these things and Morgan's cocky attitude he brings to the role helps a lot. This also becomes a redemption tale for him that I liked.Next I think I will take on the elephant in the room for this movie, religion, and the corruption there. Father Hagan is a good guy. He is raising Alice, who since her parents died has grown up in the church. She is innocent and this entity is capitalizing on it. It also heals her hearing and ability to talk. The seduction there makes sense. Father Hagan is worried as the word of what happened here gets out, ruining Alice's life like it has for others that discovered things like this. They used real events which makes it even more impactful. Father Hagan wants to protect her. This is all good aspects to it though; I do need to say that. Monsignor Delgarde is also good in my opinion. He is there to try to disprove it, but I think we should question our beliefs. Despite him coming off as hard, he just wants to make sure the validity and does seem to want to protect Alice as much as he can.This movie does explore the horrors of Catholicism and religion in general. Bishop Gyles really just wants to further the church whether it is through publicity or monetary. He seems nice at first, but is a scoundrel. We also have all of the followers who come and believe in Alice. I really think that this movie is pointing out the fact that many followers of religion do it blindly. I can see getting sucked in. Alice can talk and hear when she has never been able to. Toby Walsh (Danny Corbo) couldn't walk and now he is. Father Hagan had emphysema and she cures it, which at this time isn't possible. There are things there that can blind followers. This movie has a commentary on not blindly following and to question at all times. There is also a miracle that happens in the movie I wasn't a big fan of. I get why it is there though. It just goes against a personal preference for me.I really think that is everything I wanted to go into for the story. Next I want to talk about the acting. Morgan fits his role perfectly. He brings a bit of sarcasm and just charisma to the role. I feel like he would be this photographer. Elwes is actually solid here as well. I like that at first he seems like he could be good, but there is something there you don't trust. It makes sense as the movie goes on with reveals. Sadler is solid as Father Hagan. I'm not sure I've ever seen him in a bad role. Brown does great as Alice. She has an innocence about her that is needed. Aselton, Morgado and the rest of the cast fit for what was needed as well. The last person I would give props as well to Mazepa who is the witch of MarySome thing else that I needed to go into would be the effects. This movie does relay on jump-scares. I'll admit, there was a couple that got me which doesn't happen often. I will say that seeing this Jaime might have been part of the reason, but I'll still give credit. I do think that when they go with practical effects, those looked good to me. Seeing the dark entity I thought was creepy. Also getting to see what Alice is seeing with Mary bathed in light was good. There is some CGI fire that doesn't look good though. I did notice some other parts here as well with the CGI that don't work for me. Aside from that I would say that the cinematography was good as well.Then really the last thing to go into would be the sound design and soundtrack. For the former, I think they use it strategically. I like they quickly establish that Alice is deaf with having no sound. It has a subtle shift that she can now hear and I liked that. There are some musical cues for jump-scares. I'm not always the biggest fan there. I would say that on the whole though, the music works for what was needed.In conclusion here, I really liked this movie. Seeing the score on the Internet Movie Database and hearing that this was paint by numbers for a movie like this, I can see that. I'll probably be higher than most due to the social commentary and what I can take from it. I think the concept here is interesting. The acting was good in my opinion. The effects I'm positive on for the most part and I would say about the same for the soundtrack/design as well. To close this out here, I don't think everyone really enjoy this as much as I did. I'd say for me this is a good movie and would recommend if this sub-genre works for you. This is another movie that I do want to revisit before the end of the year as well to see where I said with a second viewing.","8","david_rudy_lee"," Interesting Concept to a Tough Genre to Do Well

"3239","A has-been journalist (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) stumbles upon the story of his career while visiting a small New England town. A deaf girl can suddenly hear and speak. Her explanation? She is channeling the Virgin Mary. We believe this as she proves she can heal the sick. A boy with muscular dystrophy can now walk. A priest no longer shows any trace of his terminal lung cancer. This causes a sensation and media/social media frenzy leading her to be identified as the chosen one.But things are about to get more complicated as the beginning sequence of the film foreshadows. Suddenly terrible things begin to happen. Is this really the work of God, or the devil in disguise? To the detriment of the film, you won't wonder too long because the movie too soon explains exactly what's going on. This ultimately keeps the film from building any real tension or suspense.I was hoping this would be like The Omen or The Exorcist. But instead of getting chilling, unnerving, and creepy, I had to settle for a bunch of The Grudge type jump scares and CGI demons.The film is not a complete loss. I wasn't bored. The acting and cinematography were strong. But ultimately The Unholy fails to deliver any real horror.","5","peterscarpinato"," Good premise doesn't deliver

"3240","I had zero expectations from this but I was pleasantly surprised.Sure, the premise is nothing original. Connecting religion, occultism and horror is as old as the bearded man in the sky. But The Unholy proves that sometimes the form is more important than originality.Jeffrey Dean Morgan fits the role, William Sadler fits his role, even Cary Elwes is the right kind of sleazy guy.The amount of jump scares could be higher, but overall it is a good horror for what it is.","7","mr-altex"," In scale 1 to 1000, I rate it 666

I jumped a few times during this movie so it was good. And Miss. Brown's character felt real, it was sad when she lost her voice again. I have to be honest though this movie felt like a knock off of The Vatican Tapes. Now that was a movie I loved! This was not great but for 2021 movies, it is well above the rest. I recommend, but I myself will not be watching it again unless I have nothing better to do.","8","gab-67599"," Not Bad

"3243","I would say it was pretty decent. At these days, it's very hard to find good horror/scary movie. To compare this film with other similar movies I can clearly say it wasn't bad. The main pros: acting was on point, idea of this movie is not ordinary, I could even say it was kind of unique. Cons: CGI/visuals very disappointing( it looked very cheap and not real), there too many scary jumps, I likes when it happened twice, but when it's happening constantly it's just getting boring and terrible ending. Everything could be good, but ending, come on. Ghost/witch/demon or whatever you will call it, defeats itself by killing family member and then God brings her back? Who taught it was a good idea... To sum up, despite cons, I would watch it again because the time flew fast and it didn't get boring.","6","Edvis-1997"," 6

"3244","The Unholy (2021) is written, co-produced and directed by Evan Spiliotopoulos in his directorial debut, based on the 1983 novel Shrine by James Herbert. Produced by Sam Raimi through its Ghost House Pictures banner, it stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Katie Aselton, William Sadler, Diogo Morgado, Cricket Brown, and Cary Elwes.Being one of the first major horror releases of 2021, The Unholy comes with a fairly interesting concept. After seeing the trailer I thought such a concept could lead to some thought provoking subject matter. But this does boil down to being a pretty textbook and bland movie. A spirit has influence over somebody, can our hero exorcise the demon?The acting is pretty good. Silly things happen like, a character walking into a room and finding a book that tells them the entire history of the demon, he does research in the archives and finds out some insignificant information that's supposed to add new depth to the story but doesn't. The monster looks quite awful and we only see practical FX for the monster in the final scene. The final act is brutally rushed. They completely neglected the corruption of the church plot line, terribly underdeveloped.Truthfully just not really many positive things to say about this one. Giving it a 3/10 for some occasionally solid lighting and a pretty fun scene with the priest in the confession booth.","3","HorrorFreak1997"," An Unholy Mess

"3246","I saw ""The Unholy"", starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan-The Walking Dead_tv, Rampage; Cricket Brown-Dukeland, Cheyenne; William Sadler-the Bill & Ted movies, Die Hard 2 and Cary Elwes-Black Christmas, No Strings Attached.This is a horror movie with a better than usual storyline. It's based on a book by James Herbert called 'Shrine'. Jeffrey is a down on his luck reporter. He was caught fabricating facts in his stories and summarily dismissed. He works freelance now and goes for the weird stories such as cattle mutilations. While investigating just such a story, he comes across Cricket. Cricket is a hearing impaired 18 year old girl that uses sign language to communicate-she doesn't talk at all-and lives with her uncle William. William just happens to be the priest at the local church. One day, Cricket starts talking and starts performing miracles. She makes a crippled boy walk, heals a man of emphysema, etc. She says that the Virgin Mary talks to her. Jeffrey has his doubts and thinks that it might be a different Mary talking to Cricket-one that might not be a virgin, perhaps? That's when the Bishop Cary comes to town to verify Cricket's deeds. There are several jump/scares; you know, like loud noises, sudden apparitions coming right at the camera, etc. At the end, there is a biblical passage shown on the screen from Matthew 7:15. If it's been a while since you went to Sunday school, it goes something like this; 'Beware of false profits, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves'.It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, terror and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.","6","stevendbeard"," Better Than Usual Storyline

"3247","A shunned reporter does a story on a deaf girl who gets their hearing through a spirit called Mary.I had low expectations going in. I only gave it a chance cause Jeffrey Dean is in it, and he's never bad. The film starts off well and does something unique. It focuses more on the human characters rather than the demon for the first half. You see sprinkles of the demon popping up here and there, but it's mostly faith based. The story surrounds a girl who is deaf and then can suddenly hear, and claims that a holy entity called Mary, healed her. Others gather around her and want to be healed as well, while others in the religious community are skeptic. Meanwhile there is something sinister lurking underneath the surface. This was the best part of film. Not showing too much of the ghost is what saved this, and just having the tension and atmosphere play out.The last half of the movie completely falls apart. It goes right into every troupe you can think of. Cheap jumpscares, moving images on computer screen, the way the demon moves around, crickling and cracking their body as they walk/crawl. It's been done to death and is just cringey at this point. It's felt like the studio gave the creators an ultimatum. ''Yeah we'll let you try to be different in the first half, but you gotta throw in horror movie cliches in order to attract annoying teenagers, since the conjuring series is so popular, or we won't finance your movie''.","4","WankerReviews"," could have been so much more

"3263","Seriously, why the low ratings?Everytime I watch a solid horror flick and I see low ratings, I always say this at the start of a review. I am a huge horror fan.From a young age, I snuck around my house, finding my parent's stash of horror video tapes and have been hooked ever since. I am no novice.Today was the first time in months, I went to the cinema. And boy, what a great movie to welcome me back.I won't go into an analysis and provide a commentary on the film, after all, that's what a trailer and a synopsis is about. I won't include any spoilers, I will just tell people who enjoy horrors, to watch this brilliant movie.Yes there's some clichÃ©s, yes there's a couple of jump scares (not that many tbh) and no it's not perfect. But the unholy is a masterful example of a solid horror film.It has a great backstory (yes a little predicable) but the lore is brilliant. The start of the movie is unnerving if you pay attention and that carries on throughout the film.The setting is brilliantly foreboding and the atmosphere is creepy as hell.The ""big bad"" of the film is creepy because it is so relavant to everything we see and encounter in this life. You just wonder, who are we really trusting. The CGI is unnecessary but that's the only bad thing about it. The evil being's voice is actually quite scary in one if the particular scenes, especially with the malice heard in its tone.Some creepy stuff happens during the course of the movie, with some unnerving imagery and ideas that are very thought provoking. All in all, I enjoyed this movie. It kept me invested from the beginning and to the end.If you appreciate a good story, a horror that relies on that story and the imagery and not on jump scares, you'll love this. It's a great movie for those who like horror, it's a good movie for those who are scared of horrors too :). Even if you don't like horror. Give it a go. The 5.2 rating is currently has is absolutely ridiculous.I find critics annoying, because they always rate mainstream movies we're ""supposed to like"" very highly and crap on most horror movies and smaller offerings.

If you want to get scared at this level, you better watch The exorcist or The Omen, which are films that take the viewer and the theme seriously.

"3272","The Unholy (2021) is a movie the Mrs and I caught in theatres this week. The storyline focuses on a reporter who accidentally unleashes a spirit that has a history of possessions in a small town. This story has the chance to jumpstart the reporters career but at what risk? This movie is directed by Evan Spiliotopoulos in his directorial debut and stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Walking Dead), Cary Elwes (Princess Bride), William Sadler (Demon Knight) and Cricket Brown. The storyline for this movie is just okay and reminded me; in terms of pace, look and feel, of a newer revitalized Darkness Falls. The acting in this is okay and I loved Jeffrey Dean Morgan's performance. Sadler also delivered his performance very, very well and you could relate to his character. The scare elements, while relying heavily on CGI, is very well done. There's several well done scenes that causes jump scares that are fun. I also liked all the scenes with the spirit and thought they presented her well. Overall this is a slightly above average addition to the genre I'd recommend viewing at least once. I'd score this a 6.5/10.","6","kevin_robbins"," This is a slightly above average addition to the genre I'd recommend viewing at least once

But my opinion worth of sticking to this movie rather then watching Last Exorcism crap I thought this movie was well made I thought Jeffery Dean Morgan did well as main lead he did great job in movie as lead I always loved Jeffery Dean Morgan you can never go wrong with him he is a great actor as well always loved Losers, The Courier, Bus 657, Rampage, and him as Negan Walking Dead show I also liked his character that's what made film for me worth watching it wasn't just that it was more I liked story and direction they went threw, it was fast pacing and it wasn't that of bad movie it did have flaws but I handle better then those stupid ratings nowadays. I liked creative staff in film camera shots, the way how it was filmed it was creative very shots, special effects the look of demon was very well done funny enough this film was shot last year. On March 14, 2020, filming was suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic. When filming resumed, due to CDC guidelines there could be no more than 10 background actors on set together at once, forcing director to use ""the same people in five different places I doubt it was tough to film during COVID-19 while it was happening last year I hoped everyone was saved during filming a horror movie that has something to do with faith and religion during COVID-19 hoping everyone to be safe.Story follows an a disgraced journalist Gerry Fenn (Jeffery Dean Morgan) he is also a drinker and specially he drinks and drive witch makes him more disgraced and also he got people fired in agency for some reason because he staffed up look his character is kinda of d*ck for being a disgraced character but it's not like you wanna hate him or say I hope his character does die no you like his character but sametime he is nice person clamming as well. Gerry hopes to revive his career visits small new England town to investigate about this girl allice (Cricket Brown) is a young 18 year old girl with hearing impaired witch means she is deaf as word comes to her after supposed visitation from Virgin Mary she prayed to her everytime then a miracle thing happened to her is now she can hear, speak then when she had a power to heal people she starts performing miracles. She makes a crippled boy walk, heals a man of emphysema, She says that the Virgin Mary talks to her. Gerry has his doubts and thinks that it might be a different Mary talking to Cricket-one that might not be a virgin, perhaps? That's when the Bishop Cary comes to town to verify Cricket's deeds. Gerry investages more about it he starts asking questions like phenomena are in works of Virgin Mary or if it's more sinister that's what you find out in this movie and also her uncle, Father Hagan (William Slather) didfine in film he does what he does in film. I thought this had many flaws CGI and jump scenes weren't the best at all and many more witch their is too many to explain so many punching holes on movie but what made it enjoyable is Jeffery Dean Morgan as lead he does fine in movie he has Morgan fits his role perfectly. He brings a bit of sarcasm and just charisma to the role. I feel like he would be this photographer. Elwes is actually solid here as well. I like that at first he seems like he could be good, but there is something there you don't trust about him witch other side of his character is a disgraced journalist I thought jumpscenes just don't care about it at all jumpscenes if it scares you that's fine but I thought 1 scary scene scared me rest of it didn't. Talking about cast I read somewhere apparently Jordana Brewster was gonna be in movie but somehow she didn't appear witch it was strange it didn't say if she dropped out or left role or couldn't go out state because of COVID-19 I was wondering what character was she gonna play?? Was she gonna be Dr Natalie Gates as (Katie Asslton) role to me I think that would be her role it seems like it she is 40 years old now and and Katie Asslton is 42 years old make sense but I would prefer to have Jordana Brewster in movie as Dr Natalie Gates I don't know why but I think because I know Jordana Brewster from Fast and Furious franchise and many more films and shows she is known more like Lethal Weapon show, Dallas many more. Director Evan Spiliotopoulos director of film is his first film but he is more of writer for movies then a director I mean it's his first film not his 10th or 20th film but I thought it wasn't his best but I thought he did great job making film but writing and ending was just so many punching holes in film he made storyline of film fun ride and it had so much potential in it but in sametime it's time waster film I wish it was a Netflix film rather then a cinema release this is a type of movie you will see it at Netflix, and theirs not much to movie as well finale wasn't huge wasn't big huge but I think because of COVID they couldn't spend too much time for movie that's why it goes for 1 hour 1h 39 minutes I am suspired why finale of film wasn't huge. For my rating is 6.10 nothing to special or exciting about movie only thing is enjoyable is Jeffery Dean Morgan that's all it is and for poitrinal storyline and for horror type of genre.","6","nikola17"," look it's not bad movie, but it's worth watching

"3287","The stupidity, the obviousness, the ridiculous dialogues and actions of the characters = The Unholy.At the heart of all the film's problems is the director's complete lack of understanding of what a horror film should be in 2021, not even in 2021, in general, the genre is completely out of reach for him.What's the point of trying to build a twist if you've already shown everything at the beginning of the movie. The ""twist"" of the film was already obvious, but they decided to remind you of it several more times in different scenes.Was it so hard to refine the script to make it at least interesting to watch? The obsolescence of the story itself is also very much felt, my God, if the director had ripped off at least the 1994 X-Files episode ""Miracle Man"" and added his non-scary spooky CGI stuff to it, it would have been somewhat watchable.Who thought that badly rendered pixels running after the main characters would scare anyone?The ending is just a clownery of bad computer effects, no more no less.At first, certain actors even tried, but in time they realized what have they gotten themselves into and stopped caring. Thanks at least for the chance to laugh at the dialogue between Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Cary Elwes, in which the priest asked why JDM wanted to sacrifice his career for this. I'm pretty sure he was talking about the movie, and his chuckle was absolutely sincere.Actually, it's so bad and incompetent that I even stopped laughing at the dumb dialogue at some point.I personally ask the director, please don't make any more horror movies. You simply don't understand what you're doing.This was truly the Thir13en Ghosts of the new generation. An absolute waste of time and effort.

"3294","PG-13 horror isn't a death-sentence for a film, but it is an awfully steep climb uphill to make it work. You have to have great characters, an investing story and a way to create tension and keep audiences on the edge of their seat. Unfortunately 'The Unholy' has none of those.The characters are painfully bland. Jeffrey Dean Morgan has a little bit of charisma and is mildly watchable but everyone else is playing a poorly written character - and playing them poorly to boot. The story here isn't investing in any way. Any twists the film think it has can be seen a mile off and because we have no care for any of the characters there is no reason for us to care at all. And the film never creates any tension. It has a lot of poorly executed jump-scares but nothing that is going to scare anyone in anyway. The PG-13 rating also ensures it can't actually show anything graphic when something does happen.This film is a mess. There are some really good horror movies that don't get cinematic releases, yet this one somehow did. Films like are ruining the genre.

"3299","I was recommended to watch the 2021 horror movie ""The Unholy"", so of course I sat down to watch it.And I will say that the movie definitely was watchable. Yeah, hold on now, because there is a but here; but, the movie just wasn't outstanding. The movie from writer and director Evan Spiliotopoulos just was a bit too predictable and generic, relying on jump scares that you see coming a mile away.When I sat down to watch ""The Unholy"" I must admit that I was stoked, because of the movie's title, its premise and because of a rather unique and interesting ensemble of cast.But even with the likes of Jeffrey Dean Morgan, William Sadler and Cary Elwes on the cast list, then the movie just never really managed to get out of the mediocre lane given the somewhat lazy writing and the predictability of the movie. It felt like these performers weren't really allowed to unfold and give the performance a full 100%.""The Unholy"" is a fairly generic and mediocre horror movie actually. But if you are new to the horror genre, then of course you will be in for quite something here. But for an avid horror fan such as myself, then writer and director Evan Spiliotopoulos just played it way too safe by following the how-to-make-a-horror-film blueprint.I will say, though, that the visuals in the movie were interesting and for the most part quite good. The CGI department did their jobs quite well here. So if for nothing else, then ""The Unholy"" is somewhat salvaged by the visuals.""The Unholy"" wasn't the movie I was hoping for, so I sit here with a somewhat flaccid sense of 'was that really it?' here as the movie ended. I felt somewhat bereft out of what could have been a great horror movie, and was instead served a lukewarm plate of predictability.My rating of ""The Unholy"" lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars.","5","paul_haakonsen"," Was that really it?...

"3305","All right, this film has a hearing actress playing the Deaf character. Of course, there are many Deaf actors and actresses who can more or less speak. Marlee Matlin comes to mind. Why was the hearing actress cast for the Deaf character?The signing skills between two actresses are medicore. They appear to have learn the sign language from the ASL dictionary a few days prior to the shooting. Thus, they do not sign fluently and naturally. Some signs they use are incorrect for the certain words.What's more, the term, ""deaf and mute"", is used to describe her. For a long time, the Deaf community has worked hard in educating the hearing community how archaic and offensive this term along with ""deaf and dumb"" is now. The Deaf people can communicate through the sign language or other forms of communication if they don't use voice or hear. Just don't call them ""deaf and mute"" or ""deaf and dumb""! It's same for the ""hearing impaired"" in the plot and synopsis. This term denotes the medical condition that indicates something is wrong with them and needs the intervention through surgery (cochlear implants, etc.) or through oralism (speech therapy, lipreading, and hearing training, etc.). Deaf people don't like this term at all because there's nothing wrong with them per se.Now, about the film. This horror flick is highly formulaic and repetitive: evil spirit is trapped in the object and is released when somebody accidentally or intentionally breaks the seal. The Catholic Church delegates come to investigate the ""miracles"" and end up exploiting the ""miracles"" for their own gain. Nothing new under the sun.This film has higher-than-usual 8, 9, and 10 stars with very short reviews. In other words, those reviewers are paid to post the ""excellent"" reviews for the medicore film with equally medicore CGI and acting. I would have given the film at least five stars if it wasn't for miscast of hearing actress, for poor signing skills, and for the offensive terms.","1","om-34"," Medicore and Offensive

"3309","""The Unholy"" has one of the most interesting premises for a horror movie that I've seen in recent years: What if Marian apparitions, though apparently divine, were in reality demonically influenced? It's a really intriguing plot that I was looking forward to experiencing on the big screen, so I headed down to the theatre on Easter Sunday (sacrilegious, I know), and I was honestly pretty excited. And I'm proud to announce that this movie is akin to a religious experience, because when the credits rolled I prayed for forgiveness for wasting my time watching such a mediocre movie.""The Unholy"" isn't a bad film - it's just painfully average and generic. It has a goldmine at its disposal with its clever premise, and instead it throws every good idea by the wayside to instead fill its running time with cheap jump scares and lazy exposition. You've already seen all the tricks this movie has up its sleeve, and you've seen them done better a countless number of times before. A demon infecting a computer? Check. A face popping out of a body of water? Check. A character turning around and getting scared by a demon lunging toward them? Check. I was shocked to see all of the exact same excuses for scares that have already been utilized so many times before.At its core, the movie follows Jeffrey Dean Morgan as he reports on Cricket Brown's character, Alice, a deaf, mute girl who suddenly can hear and speak after a visit from who she claims is the Virgin Mary. Jeffrey and Cricket were the only good things about this film, and the movie was honestly lucky to have them; Cricket was especially good in her role, convincingly playing a sweet, overly religious girl who thinks that, for once in her life, she's being chosen for a higher purpose. Every time Cricket is on screen she steals the show - unfortunately, she isn't on screen for that much, and instead the movie focuses on horrendously boring exposition.A large majority of this film centers on Jeffrey's character speaking to other characters about things that are happening, or things that have happened. I'm not even going to go in any more detail because it was extremely boring to watch, and I don't want to relive those moments through my words. Instead, I'll talk about another thing that the movie did do well: The scenes where Mary was working her magic through Cricket were genuinely riveting, displaying a talent in front of and behind the camera. Mary, through Alice, heals the sick and makes the disabled walk, and the scenes are filmed beautifully and feel holy. They're a nice contrast to the inevitable evil that's displayed as the film goes on, but unfortunately, nothing comes close to the competence demonstrated in those scenes. The rest of the film is a generic slog, jam-packed with highly telegraphed jump scares and lazy dialogue.If you're a fan of horror films, you'll probably want to check out ""The Unholy."" And if you do, may God have mercy on your soul. This isn't a movie that I hated watching, but it's one that I found highly disappointing due to the squandering of such a unique premise.","4","darkreignn"," Painfully generic - what a waste of a unique premise

"3315","""The Unholy"" is based on the gothic horror novel, ""Shrine"", by the late horror author James Herbert.Ask Stephen King how often that's worked out for him.The basic storyline is this...a hearing-impaired good Catholic girl is visited by what she believes to be the Virgin Mary.She can suddenly hear, speak, and heal the sick.It's now up the Church to investigate if this is truly a miracle and meets their three fundamental requirements.Tick all those boxes and come in Spinner we've got a Winner.To prove some people are sheep they literally flock to witness her miracles.Only thing is terrifying events unfold.Are they the work of the Virgin Mary or something much more sinister?There are a few jump frights to make a cinema audiences lose their popcorn.Fans of the TV Series ""Supernatural"" may like this especially when you learn dear old dad, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, is playing washed up journo, Gerry Fenn, who breaks the story then has to fight with his conscience and a seven foot tall apparition.Morgan is great in every role he plays from Walking Dead to Suicide Squad.Wonderful character actor, William Sadler, is Father Hagan who should have given up the fags.They tell you on the packet they will kill you.Cricket Brown is Alice the girl at the centre of this story from beyond the grave.The normally beautiful Marina Mazepa undergoes a hideous transformation in the prosthetics department making her into Mary.If I've learned one thing watching ""The Unholy"" it's be careful who you pray to...am I right?It's a well made horror movie, but I'm still waiting for something really scary on the big screen in 2021.I didn't get goosebumps, but maybe you will.Wanna see something really scary?Cary Elwes (Saw) plays a Bishop and in real life is related to several prominent Catholic clerics.Why not he's already starred as a young Pope in Pope John Paul 11 and has made a career in horror.","5","waltermwilliams"," Be careful who you pray to...am I right?

"3317","Listen, I have no issue with religious themes in movies, including horror movies. One of my favourite films is the Conjuring, which is also very heavy handed in its religious themes. However, The Unholy takes the cake in this regard, to the point where the film ends with a Bible verse, as if it was an episode of VeggieTales.So the Unholy follows two main characters, a down on his luck journalist who makes ends meet by working for a shady conspiracy website, and a young deaf woman, who inexplicably gains the ability to hear and speak, and credits the Virgin Mary as the source of this healing.The film is more or less a parable about false prophets and healthy skepticism even within religion. One of the side characters is in fact a priest who is hired by the Vatican to approach the alleged miracles committed by the Virgin Mary with a sense of skepticism. In this film, God exists, but is a more distant, measured version, while the Devil takes the initiative and pretends to be God to fulfill his misdeeds. This moral is very heavy handed, which leads more atheistic horror fans such as myself wondering if I'm the intended audience, or if this is a very misguided attempt at making a movie to show at Youth Group.Aside from this, there's a few other issues with the film. The main antagonist, the false 'Virgin Mary', is not very scary. In fact the design of the character is very odd, especially after she is 'unmasked' at the end, looking like a cartoony version of Red Skull. The creators of the film get around this design flaw with copious amounts of jump scares, which begs the question as to why any of the main characters believe that the false Mary is the real Mary in the first place, if every second or so she is jump scaring one of the main characters.However, I will give the film credit for at least having a bit of imagination, and not being as ashamed of its religious themes as many other supernatural horror movies out there are. This film at least has some gusto to name drop the Virgin Mary, Jesus, and God, which is surprisingly rare in these movies. Even in movies where the Catholic Church features heavily, movie producers seem to try and fenagle their ways around being explicit in their themes, in order to not offend or alienate anyone, but this movie does the opposite. It is a very Catholic, very Christian movie, for better and for worse.I didn't hate it, probably as much as I should, but it could have been a lot better.","5","seige-hound"," Sunday School Lesson disguised as a horror movie

"3327","I watched ""The United States vs Billie Holiday"" on Hulu, and this film literally left me drained. Andra Day nails her portrayal of Billie Holiday. She is sensational. But this film showcases what happens when a great performance ends up in an absolutely awful film.The only time The United States vs Billie Holiday comes to life is when Andra Day is on-screen. She took trite dialogue and made it magic. And her version of Billie Holiday's songs were powerful, but when she sang ""Strange Fruit"", it gave me chills.This biopic about the last years in Holiday's life, and how the authorities pursued and harassed her just because she refused to stop singing ""Strange Fruit"", is as average as it is lethargic. There is no real direction and Lee Daniels got lost and never found his way out of the weeds. There was no tension, no reason to be invested in any of these characters except Billie Holiday, and that was fully due to Andra Day. Then you had a way over-the-top dog's funeral, Roy Cohn ( Senator Joseph McCarthy's chief counsel) and an insinuated lesbian relationship between Holiday and actress Tallulah Bankhead. Who knows if they had a thing....this film was splintering off in every direction imaginable, and it never found its center.This was an ambitious film that never fulfilled its potential. Though Daniels has found his his niche in some areas, but this is not that niche. A truly skilled director and writer could have made a masterpiece, but Daniels and Suzan-Lori Parks, who wrote this schlock, never made the story and vision they had in their heads come to life, and that's a pity because the subject matter was there. I sincerely hope that Day wins an award for her performance, because she deserves it for making sweet tasting lemonade out of a hot mess of a film.","5","syd9907"," The 5 Stars are ONLY for Andra Day's Performance

"3328","Lady Day deserves much better than this muddled, often tedious and substantially apocryphal ""biopic"" from Lee Daniels. In this telling of Billie Holiday's life the song Strange Fruit becomes central to the narrative, with government forces determined to stop her singing the mournful lament, afraid that it will ignite a civil rights movement. At one point she's even dragged from the stage after singing just the first few lines. The problem with all of this is it never happened. Federal Narcotics chief Harry Anslinger apparently claimed in letters that he ""asked"" holiday not to sing the song, but - even if that's true - that's about as far as it went. Holiday was never dragged off stage for singing the song; in fact, she sang the song in the very concert in which the film depicts this as happening. In any case, the civil rights movement was already a growing force long before Strange Fruit became a popular protest song. As for Billie, she was never especially political and was initially ambivalent about performing Strange Fruit. She was convinced more by the way it would be dramatically staged as a final number than by any notions about the political clout of the lyrics. So to make the song central to her life and have Billie so passionate about performing it any cost is in itself dishonest. But then so much of Daniels' film, from the weird Quentin Crisp-like Reginald Lord Divine character who interviews Billie (he never existed) to the romantic affair with FBI agent Jimmy Fletcher, for which there is zero evidence. At best the film offers brief glimpses into the reality of Billie's life, but they're so swamped with apocrypha that you'll have trouble identifying them. Which makes this a pretty messed up biopic, and an extremely half-assed tribute to the great singer. The only saving grace in all of this is Andra Day, who manages to look and sound like Billie for the most part. But even here there are caveats. Day's performances of Holiday's songs are more impressive as vocal impressions than they are for evoking the emotion and pathos that made Billie legendary. And, sad to say, her rendition of Strange Fruit is oddly stilted, almost bland. Not to mention severely truncated. Never mind that this is the song the entire film revolves around. Strange, indeed.","4","ozjosh03"," Lady Day vs Fake History

One could say that the movie is more about ""look how Andra Day looks and talks and sings like Billie Holiday"" than about the artist's life, I mean we all heard her songs a thousand times over the years do we really need so many musical numbers? We have the records silly! It's just a bunch of scenes stuck together with almost no continuity for 2 hours, not that linearity is a must for any picture but if you're telling the story of a person that actually lived you might as well have some, right? Andra Day is amazing and I hope she gets nominated for an Academy Award! That said, go watch Lady Sings The Blues or read Billie's autobigraphical book with the same name.","3","rafajack-56549"," A bad script vs. Billie Holiday

"3334","Andra Day is very talented and she definitely has potential as an actress with the right director and screenplay. Her singing is excellent in the film - she hits every one of Billie Holiday's hauntingly earthy inflections. The problem is the film itself. It is very confusing with characters in and out who are not explained. We don't learn a lot of substance about Billie Holiday's life - at least anything verifiable - except what we already knew from Lady Sings the Blues. Perhaps my expectations were too high, no pun intended, but I expected this film to give audiences a more intimate picture of her life - her as a complex woman, not just a singing caricature with a heroin needle in her arm. Instead, this is another one of those biopics where the lead actor or actress does more character imitation than provide true insights into the actual subject and her life. This is also one of those films where the singing goes on far too long, but when that happens you know it's because the writing and screenplay are usually thin and the music is used to overcompensate for that. One of the most disturbing things for me is that the film shows a lot of men in and out of her life, and even tries to create romance out of a viciously violent relationship, her and Lewis McCabe. I need films to stop pretending that Black women love to have their asses stomped by the men in their lives. That's NOT love so don't sugar coat it on film. It's even worse that this is a very light complected woman who never has a single bruise on her face when we see her, even as he's constantly smacking and punching her. I think this film probably could have been a lot better with a different director and certainly with a much better screenplay.","3","blaxblew"," Andra Day gives a solid performance in a very poor screenplay

"3335","I have been a Lady Day fan as long as I can remember. I am always skeptical when a movie or book come out that they will tell an accurate story. This movie was as honest as they come.
It is hard to portray the very complicated life of Billie Holiday in just a few hours, but they pulled it off.

"3339","Which is scant praise indeed, as that Billie Holiday biopic was mostly a Diana Ross vehicle complete with cover tunes. And while she gave an enjoyable, Oscar nominated performance, the film really sold Holiday, and especially her music, short. It should be noted that most of the lyrics of Strange Fruit were omitted. So much so that I didn't even 'get' that song when watching the film upon its release.But this film puts Strange Fruit right, although it takes an agonizing hour and a half to hear it. But it does little else right. It's a huge, huge disappointment. Within the first 5 minutes we have terrible acting (Jimmy's mom, clearly dubbed), a very kludgey script, and lots and lots of ho-hum-ness. Hard to believe that this was directed by the same person who did The Butler and Empire.It seems as if the director was trying to make a highly stylized, tongue in cheek film about Holiday's legal and political problems, and thus a less than obvious statement about America's sketchy racial past. Instead, it's too obvious, gratuitously anachronistic, as if only to please modern (young) audiences, and otherwise useless. With two, count 'em, two, big budget, high profile biopics about Holiday, you'd think one could get her right, esp this one, with the benefit of hindsight help from the first film.Andra Day is fine as an elegant Holiday, and my few stars are for her and some of the other cast. The sets and costumes are great, if much out of time. Day's gowns are real eye candy, for sure, and Day is stunning, from her perfect hair down to her perfect shoes. Unfortunately, none of this makes the plodding, clumsy, retread rote grade school wokeness (and I'm usually all about woke, but can't we have a smart, grown up approach?) of this film worth it. Huge waste of money, talent, and Billie Holiday's memory. Please, would somebody get her legacy on film right someday????","3","caramia2002"," Better to Watch ""Lady Sings the Blues""

"3340","Billie Holiday has been dead for more than 60 years and no one yet has managed to create a decent biographic film of her sad, squalid, and too-brief life.The first - and biggest problem - is a screenplay riddled with errors, inaccuracies, and clichés. As other have noted, it makes this unwatchable (I started to fast-forward about 90 minutes in).The production itself - despite its voyeuristic obsession with sex and violence - looks like it came from Disney. I feel disgusted to use this word, but it has been whitewashed beyond comprehension.Andra Day gives a credible performance and does an decent imitation of Holiday's voice, but it's all technique and no soul.I can speak with some authority on the disarray of her life: for 12 years I worked for the record company which owns the rights to a huge amount of her prime recordings, and the first that issued a 10-CD box when digital technology was new. I got caught up in the legal battles over the royalties to her recordings, a nasty, greedy affair by people who never met her, only adding another sad chapter to her legacy.","2","LProductions-837-667666"," Another lost opportunity
"
"3341","The costumes and overall historical production design looks good, and Andra Day is great playing Billie Holiday, but otherwise ""The United States vs. Billie Holiday"" is a meandering, poorly-constructed biopic. That despite the reflexive framing of the story as a recorded interview that should've focused the narrative besides reflecting the audial sensation of Holiday's singing.Instead, we get a plot that often doesn't seem to be going anywhere besides from scene to scene of shooting up heroin, from concert to concert and abuse or sex scenes from man to man, with a hint of bisexuality. A wallowing, hot-mess portrait of Lady Day. All the while, cut occasionally to narcs planting evidence or saying something racist and inevitably being told off to presumed audience cheering. Even if the remembered scenes of Holiday's past as the black FBI agent follows her from a lynching through her upbringing in a brothel is almost effective, the montage covering again the aforementioned sort of scenes we've already seen several times in slight variations, plus some fight between two guys, certainly isn't. And to top it off there's that atonal, fourth-wall-breaking mid-credits scene after the requisite biopic text at the end to give us the Wikipedia headlines of what happened to the characters after the movie.Yet, Day is great, an actual singer who sings the part and in the imitated style of the character she's performing. Her reported weight loss and picking up of smoking and drinking for the part is some impressive dedication, too, even if she wisely didn't go to Nick Nolte levels of method acting in using heroin as he did for ""The Good Thief"" (2002). Day deserved better direction, the social commentary on civil rights deserved more than simplistic tropes, ""Strange Fruit"" better than ""Tigress and Tweed,"" and Holiday a more focused biographical picture.I'll have to check out ""Lady Sings the Blues"" (1972), which stars Diana Ross and also received awards attention, someday for comparison.","4","Cineanalyst"," Day Brightens Dull Biopic
"
"3342","The title is a tip-off that this isn't going to be a general bio-pic. It's a prosecution of a case. Director Lee Daniels has never been accused of being a subtle filmmaker, but here he and writer Suzan-Lori Parks are weilding a mighty gavel. It's a miracle than novice singer turned actress Andra Day still shines.The basic facts here are indisputable: Billie Holiday was hounded by the government, had a series of bad marriages and died at a tragically young age (44). Still, Daniels' approach of dwelling solely on the abuses of Holiday's life, whether they be legal, physical, sexual or narcotics- related, does a disservice not only to the singer, but to the 'case' he is trying to make. Daniels uses a catalog of tricks which sometimes work - using 16mm and 35mm film for flashbacks (although using digital 'scratches' on the celluloid is a hoary cliche); And some that don't - a long heroin fueled fever dream.What's missing here is Holiday's artistry. Her inner soul. She had affairs with famous, successful people of both sexes -- but there's no evidence here of why they would be attracted to her. Surely, she had a wit and a charm that goes beyond being an attractive famous chanteuse. Parks' script focuses on the blunt-spoken, yet needy part of her personality, not her passions.Day does a remarkable job in a blunt, honest way that isn't all actor-ticks. And, unsurprisingly, the singer shines on stage during the performance scenes. It's a breakthrough for her, even if the film around her is in shambles. One is much better off with one of the numerous Documentaries on Holiday.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","gortx"," Breakthrough performance by Andra Day

Impeccable gowns and hairstyling add to the glamor and realism of the music being sung so beautifully by her swingin, emotional voice. Day expresses a lot in those eyes tender one minute and giving diva the next.

"3353","Andra Day is solid in what is ultimately a wildly underwhelming story that should really be far more moving than it is. The United States vs Billie Holiday is a biopic that feels so recycled and stale it's hard to believe. Swap a few details around and you basically have ""Judy"" all over again, an underwhelming film about a misunderstood and victimized female musician with the only saving grace being in the performance of the titular lead. Judy is an underwhelming film and so was this. Where the US vs BH really falters though is in how aggressively it hammers away at all the same old points again and again.Throw in the constant blacksploitation thing, which is likely 100% accurate for the story and a subject that still deserves to be discussed but is delivered with all the emotional potency of of stale bread, makes this feel like such a try hard for Oscar season. I mean, it follows the recipe well enough of a period piece about a misunderstood genius struggling with substance abuse while delivering a movie carrying performance. It's the exact same thing that will give Gary Oldman attention in Mank, it's a formula that has worked it's just dull and overplayed. I want a Billie Holiday story with some soul, some fire, some passion and this is so not it.If you're looking for a generic, by the numbers, cookie cutter biopic that's clearly aiming for awards rather than actual quality then viola! There are a bunch of other options out there that are better, but I suppose this works for what it wants. There are so many better films though worth your time.

It seems almost incongruous to include Ms Andra Day's jaw-dropping performances (singing and acting), perfect sets, and period accoutrements with the dark American realities of racial prejudice, segregation, lynchings, and Billie Holiday's ongoing, unethical, no holds barred, racially-motivated persecution by the US government. For singing a song!The U.S. vs Billie Holiday is a great must-see film that I, a Black American, almost passed on because I am wearying of one of the painful shrouded negative truths of African American history being constantly illuminated for entertainment purposes: famous and revered Black American icons (Billie Holiday, Fred Hampton, Malcolm X), persecuted by the US government while simultaneously betrayed (sometimes murdered) by their own (reminiscent of the adage Crabs in a Basket).

"3365","Jazz singer Billie Holliday struggles with addiction to heroin and men while being persistently harassed by the FBI for racist reasons.A spectacularly impressive recreation of a historical milieu, with settings, costumes, make-up, ways of speaking and cultural attitudes supremely realistic and immersive. Every scene is a magnificently composed world, but together they form no cohesive narrative, no complex thematic expression apart from a recreation in popular form of a racist history, and no interesting trajectory for a complex, inspirational, talented woman apart from self-destruction and degeneration. There is no depth, no overarching motivation, no transformation, just a pain explained in flashbacks of trauma. Like her controversial song ""Strange Fruit"", the painful and shameful recent history of racist America is being revealed, but is Holliday's strength and talent and legacy being honoured, is her story being given the depth it deserves? Andra Day's performance is the same, extremely impressive on the surface, powerfully lucid within an individual scene, but no dramatic shape. Perhaps the screenplay is to blame. It amounts to a glossy surface and no heart.The film's political theme is clear: lynchings have not yet been banned, even if her song about them was. But the more intimate theme is perhaps akin to Asif Kapadia's powerful documentary Amy: that we, from our distance, though the veil of the media, have some empathy and patience for the particular and real challenges faced by those who pour themselves into music for us.","6","Quinoa_Chris_Kirk"," Historical recreation with no dramatic structure

"3366","The United States vs Billie Holiday is the highly anticipated film on the legendary singer meant to explore her life and struggles against the US government. Unfortunately it comes off as are confusing and poorly executed film directed by Lee Daniels. Lee Daniels attempts to distract a biopic on the legendary singer, but unfortunately seems to be confused about the time he wants to make. He doesn't know whether or not to make a film on the legendary singer and her life and struggles or a commentary on the drug war and it shows and over shadows the piece. What doesn't help matters is the cinematography of the film which looks like into a TV movie and not a theatrical release which is sad, because it has a great cast to make this work. If you're looking for a film that talks about the historical aspects of her life, then please focus your attention elsewhere. Understand, that when it comes to films based on people that actually lived, dramatic license will be taken that's just a fact. In this case, the mountain historical inaccuracies are too much to ignore.Of the fault of the film none should fall on the cast which does an incredible job in the roles that they are given, especially day as Billie Holiday herself. The work she's put in to create her own portrayal of holiday shines through and it's a highlight of the film. Her talents the talents of the cast in general are wasted in this confused mess that chooses to focus more the physical abuse from her male lovers and drug use and not her actual struggles with the government due to her song Strange Fruit.

I looked at the list this year and 'The United States vs. Billie Holiday' stood out clearly as being the one that interested me the least. I have never heard a Billie Holiday song before, the plot didn't sound very interesting and the IMDb rating was significantly lower than all the other films. Sometimes those films that you least expect to like are the ones that blow you away. Sadly that was not the case on this occasion. I didn't have much fun with this one at all.Andra Day has been nominated for Best Actress at the Academy Awards and it couldn't be more deserved. The fact she shines so brightly in a film that is so messy and dull only makes it that much better. I'm loving this trend lately of singers taking on acting roles and knocking it out of the park. Her singing was beautiful and she played the part perfectly, never skipping a scene. It wasn't a glamorous role, but she was willing to get dirty and gritty and I respect that.The films biggest problem is that it is just so dull. There is no tension or drama created. We are basically just told that this woman is a train-wreck - now watch her for two hours. That's not much fun. Also I understand that she was far from a perfect person, but when she's our lead character and she's this selfish and self-destructive it is almost impossible to side with her.

"3379","IN BRIEF: A commanding Andra Day brings her star power to this good but flawed bio-pic.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) Lee Daniel's The United States vs. Billie Holiday is a very flawed film that boast a very good performance in the title role. So let's start on a positive note with the magnificent film debut of singer Andra Day. It is phenomenal. Her bold and memorable turn as this talented vocalist conveys her tortured soul and her ability to self-destruct with agonizing details of physical abuse and graphic close-ups of injections. Booze and heroin are her downfall, and so is the willful mission by J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI to destroy this musical icon. It is indeed a story worth telling, but it is the telling of the story that becomes the film's downfall.Targeted by the government for promoting dissent with her signature song, Strange Fruit, a song that decries lynching, FBI agent Harry J. Anslinger (Garett Hedlund) wields his power to arrest Billie with trumped-up charges. He hires a Black agent, Jimmy Fletcher (Trevante Rhodes), to act as an informant and cozy up to the singer. The government's crusade against her prevents the singer from performing in various venues around the country and affects her livelihood.The screenplay by the gifted playwright Suzan-Lori Parks never gels, with some powerful scenes that linger and others that confuse. Too much dramatic license is used in the film's narrative. Characters are sketchy and so are many of the facts to this biography. Timelines are jumbled and motives and actions are vague at best. The non-linear storytelling needs better focus, not to mention, a more positive image for men's rights. Every male in this movie is evil or toxic.Mr. Daniel's direction remains solid, although he gives in to his own excesses too often. He successfully captures the period details of this era. The camera movement flows and transitions quite well, but every scene seems to be filmed with an exclamation point when a period would do fine. The quiet moments are few in this crushed life.However, whenever Ms. Day is onscreen, which is often, she shines. Her concert scenes provide enough of the heartbreak. Ms. Day's singing inflections and vocal range mimic the legendary Lady D to a T. It is a magnificent performance to behold. And her acting proves to be on that same par. Giving her fine support is Da'Vine Joy Randolph as her best girlfriend, but the actress is given little to do. Casting by other cast members is uneven, mostly due to the underdeveloped characters that surround the singer's orbit. As her (fictional) lover, Mr. Rhodes is never convincing in his role and Mr. Hedlund, while good, is given a racist and one-note villain to play. Even more off are the campy interpretations of real life figures Tallulah Bankhead and a Quentin Crisp wannabe called Reginald Lord Divine that seriously hinder the authenticity of the movie. Natasha Lyonne downplays her role into nothingness while Leslie Jordan overplays his dance card here. Both actors have done better work.The United States vs. Billie Holiday is another flawed opportunity to do justice to its legendary performer. Though earnest in its intentions, and finding the perfect actress for this breakout role, the film never makes a totally compelling case. It's good, with many riveting scenes, the sum of its parts don't make a sustainable whole. With a more concise narrative, this movie could have been great. Nevertheless, moviegoers should take in the both Ms. Days, the tragic Lady Day and the glorious Ms. Andra Day. (GRADE: B)","8","jadepietro"," Day Break

"3382","I won't lie I was in thence at first since I really don't know too much about Billie Holiday's life story and only knew a little about her music. I did read that it picked up right as she went into prison for ""narcotics use"". I know previous movies went in and explained her start but this was about why she was the way she was, how she was the voice of her people, American people who were being burned and lynched. The. Government couldn't blame her for singing but they could for drugs so it's the suppression of making a statement but wrapped in a blanket rule breaking when it was blatant racism. I will say it starts slow and if you don't know her life you are getting an eyes wide view of a ""junkie"" but quickly escalates and you can see that sang people paid attention. Spoiler alert here: I watch horror movies and so in that context not much makes me jump but the scene when Billie stumbles onto a family whose house was burned and children crying because their parent was lynched, just watching as the words ""justice served"" shocked me. I still feel stunned and the feeling she felt and why she was the way she was just made sense why she pushed through and sang her song. What's more horrific is that anti-lynching laws have never passed congress to this day . You just feel like you know her through song and Andra Day did a terrific job conveying a story who lived a tragic life but left a piece of her soul through her music. Give it a chance, it will hopefully open you up to why ""Strange Fruit"" was epic to understanding civil inhumanity and why it needed/needs to be heard.","10","nave-25931"," Pain Through Song

"3385","I went very sceptical into this movie because of all the bad reviews here. I even postponed watching it until my wife found out there was a BH biopic, thank you Golden Globes. After watching and enjoying the movie I didn't get it why reviewers we're so harsh.
First of all, it's a biopic not a biography, if you don't know anything about the life of an artist watch a documentary first or read a book. Although going through the movie they feed you enough information about what happened to her in the past and even the future, so the storyline ""an sich"" is strong enough.The acting was very good and the production team was really able to catch that eerie atmosphere not only surrounding Billie, but coming from Billie herself too, without making it a dark alternative movie. The storyline was pretty chronological, so easy to follow with a good pace. Only if you don't know much about Billie's life the beginning can be a bit confusing or a bit too fast.","8","webwizardbe"," A solid 7.5 but an extra 8 'cause of too many bad reviews

Tbh this movie really didn't not feel like a Hulu movie, it felt more like a movie that could come out in theaters but couldn't obviously due to the Covid pandemic.

"3391","The United States vs Billie Holiday is a poorly written movie; where there is no consistent narrative flow, instead just moments that try its best to evoke an emotional reaction, and at that too, it fails. The first 40 minutes gave the impression that this movie has nothing substantive to offer, and with each passing minute thereon, you're left proven right.This doesn't mean that there aren't anything good about this movie, because there is Andra Day; whose portrayal of the famed Jazz Singer is very easily one of the best performances of the year. And it was truly something else. It honestly is a performance that does Billie Holiday justice and saves this movie from being easily forgotten.I don't think The United States vs Billie Holiday will be a movie I'd be quick to recommend to anyone.

The directing and the editing simply weren't right for the story they were trying to tell.

"3404","This film is two-for-one: (1) engaging movie and (2) live concert. As USA Today critic Brian Truitt wrote, ""Because Daniels filmed her singing live, 'Strange Fruit' and other old songs feel vibrant and resonant."" What other movie songs are performed and recorded live? It is ground-breaking. Sumptuous sets contrast with no-frills emotions of Billie Holiday and her entourage. . . Costumes, furnishings, and production values noted in the mainstream press would display well on large theater screens, the way director Lee Daniels intended, but watching online has its advantages. Subtitles and the ability to rewind rescue the many one-liners of the fast-paced dialogue. The United States vs. Billie Holiday is no light popcorn fare. It is an intense and dark journey of celebrity targeted by authorities determined to make an example, selfish hangers-on, drug pushers, and abusive men. A light romance fantasy conjured from artistic license counters the harsh reality documented by the film . . . Enjoy a final live performance and floaty dream reunion a la Titanic in the closing credits. Bravo, Lee Daniels and co!","9","VideoConnoisseur"," Two-for-One

"3405","To start off on a positive note, Andra Day is phenomenal. She brings this character to live and shows us both sides of the coin. You can feel the joy when she sings and performance, but also the sadness and pain of her past. She is without a doubt the best thing that comes out of this movie. Also, the soundtrack is amazing to listen to. I am a big fan of old jazz music, so it was a joy to watch these songs be performed. They did overuse the music a bit because some scenes became depended on the song that was playing. The big problem with this movie is the execution of the story. Everything was in place for this movie to be something special, but it's just very messy. You know some scenes are very imported, but you don't get that feeling because there aren't set up right. The storyline of Jimmy Fletcher is also very interesting, but very poorly executed. It just doesn't feel right. I doesn't have a consisted tone and feels all over the place. Even tho it wraps up the story nicely, you just feel disappointed at the end. I just keep thinking what could have been and that's never a good thing.","5","joostkale"," Andra Day shines in this flat story
"
"3406","I have to mark this film way down for calling Strange Fruit ""her song."" Billie Holiday is certainly associated with it more than any other, but she did not write the lyrics and calling it her song is a very serious error of judgement by director Lee Daniels. Her ownership in the public mind, or even in her own mind, is one thing, but for the filmmaker to make the claim in the manner he did (on a text slate to start the film) is essentially fatal for the film.The writer of the song is Abel Meeropol, aka Lewis Allan. Meeropol, son of Russian Jewish immigrants, seems an interesting person in his own right. In addition to writing what has been called the American song of the century, he apparently also taught high school English to James Baldwin and adopted and raised the sons of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, famously executed by the U. S. in 1953 as spies for the Soviet Union.By that accounting alone he seems like a character who would bring interest to a movie. According to her Wikipedia page, Holiday claimed in her book Lady Sings the Blues that she co-wrote the music to the song with Meeropol. Unless that claim has been proven false, this would have been an entirely appropriate scene for the film, given its heavy focus on the song.Daniels ought to have pressed himself to rise to occasion and do right by Meeropol instead of trying to do him out of his claim to fame.","4","jmstm"," A Fatal Flaw

"3407","My Review - The United States vs Billie Holiday
My Rating - 8/10There are some fantastic Academy Award performances this year 5 great Actresses and I've now seen four of them Frances McDormand in Nomadland , Carey Mulligan in Promising Young Woman , Viola Davis in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom and now Andra Davis in The United States vs Billie Holliday . I've yet to see Vanessa Kirby in Pieces of a Woman but intend to watch her movie today.
I must say up until today my favourite nominated performance by an Actress in a film is Carey Mulligan but today I've changed my mind because Andra Davis is mesmerising as Billie Holiday.
Almost 50 years after Diana Ross earned an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Billie Holiday in 1972's ""Lady Sings the Blues"" this new film that centres around the origin of the song that Billie Holiday sang titled ""Strange Fruit."" which is now included in the Top 100 American songs list.
Harry Anslinger a known racist ,played in the movie so well by Garrett Hedland forbids Billie Holiday to perform ""Strange Fruit,"" because he didn't want it's painful message of racial hate to be heard by Billie's audiences.
Of course Billie refuses causing him to devise a plan to destroy her. Knowing that Holiday was a drug user. He assigns Federal Bureau of Narcotics, federal agent Jimmy Fletcher ( Trevante Rhodes) to bust her for heroin possession and he ends up falling for her.
Billie Holiday popularised the song ""Strange Fruit"" and turned it into a work of art, but it was a Jewish communist teacher and civil rights activist from the Bronx, Abel Meeropol, who wrote it, first as a poem, then later as a song.
Abel Meeropol's inspiration for the song from a 1930 photo that captured the lynching of two Black men in Indiana. The visceral image haunted him for days and prompted him to put pen to paper.
The Star of the 1972 movie about Billie Holliday ""Lady Sings the Blues ""Diana Ross's son Evan Ross plays a federal agent in Lee Daniels' new movie about the late singer. his mom, Diana Ross, earned an Oscar nom for her portrayal of Billie Holiday she lost that year to Liza Minneli in Cabaret.
Now, Evan says his mother approves of the latest telling of the Holiday story.
""She loves Lee, and she thought it was cinematically amazing. She thought the performances were amazing.""
Everything you see and hear in the movie is 100% Andra Davis who sings many Billie's classic songs herself . The closing song a full performance of ""Strange Fruit"" is one of those moments like Barbra Streisand singing My Man in ""Funny Girl ""that I thought ,yes ! that is a performance that could win you an Oscar ,so much feeling and emotional output.
Andra's preparation for this taxing role including smoking, drinking, and screaming which gave her voice the ""gravel and grit"" that the blues singer was known for. ""Anything I'd do to take care of my voice as a singer, I did the opposite,"" she said.
One of the most interesting plot lines concerning Billie Holliday that I wasn't aware of in ""Lady Sings the Blues ""was Billie's bi sexuality and her long affair with Tallulah Bankhead played in this film by Natasha Leon.
My film companion and I discussed the similarities between Bessie Smith . Ma Rainey , Billie and also Judy Garland.
All these great singers had violent and abusive relationships with men that held power over ""their""women and used them as a meal ticket and to boost their ego.
So why wouldn't they look for affection and gentleness in their women friends who just valued them for themselves.
The second great similarity was that all these women were addicts and died in their 40's except Ma Rainey who lived a little longer at 53 years old , they all burnt out far too early leaving their legacy of music behind them for audiences to enjoy.
The intimate friendship between dissolute husky-voiced first lady of the American stage Tallulah Bankhead (1902-1968) and the great doomed jazz chanteuse Billie Holiday (1915-1959) spanned at least two decades - from the golden age of 1930s Harlem cafe society until the mid-1950. In 1948, Tallulah Bankhead used to watch Holiday's closing set every night of her run performing with Count Basie. She also accompanied Holiday on her own tours whenever she could.
""Tally and Lady were like sisters,"" as one observer put it. Fierce, stylish sisters with a tinge of incest, apparently.
Stories of Judy Garland frequenting female partners are perhaps more than fanciful Hollywood recitals; most famously, she was linked to Betty Asher, an MGM publicity worker and close friend of the starlet.
Betty Asher, to become Judy's confidante, her bosom buddy, and to steer her away from Artie Shaw. Betty did much more than that. She became Judy's lover as well (and Shaw's, too, for that matter).
I love both the Billy Holiday films Lady Sings the Blues and The United States vs Billie Holliday but I think if I was awarding an Oscar for the most honest and convincing portrayal of who many still say was the Worlds greatest jazz artist I would pick Andre Davis and I wish her luck this year ,I'd be also very happy to see Carey Mulligan win for Promising Young Woman.
The great costumes by Paolo Nieddu make up ,set decoration and production excellence in The United States vs Billie Holliday are obvious from the opening titles Lee Daniels has directed a fine film.","8","tm-sheehan"," Worthy of an Academy Award for Andra Davis

"3410","I was ten years old when Billie Holiday died but it was not until a few years later years I would listen to Billie Holiday. In 1972 I was 23 years old and in anticipation, I went to the Cinema to watch ''Lady Sings the Blues'' I came away feeling disappointed, so I'm a little puzzled by reviewers holding up that film as better than ""The United States vs Billie Holiday'' as one film is a biopic and the other focuses on one period?As ""Lady Sings the Blues'' opens we see Diana Ross being thrown into a padded cell and immediately I notice that the hairstyle is instantly recognizable as Diana Ross and not Billie Holiday? Today many films based on the truth you find Directors selecting an actor who at least resembles the person they are portraying and this is what I see when I watch Andra Day playing Billie Holiday.
Both these artists are great singers in their genre but Diana Ross has a much sweeter tone in her vocal not to mention that she also has a much wider range which in truth the real Billie Holiday did not have. On the other hand, Andra Day has that huskiness to her voice that the real Billie Holiday also had at this point go to YouTube and listen to Billie Holiday singing ""All of Me'' then listen to Diana Ross and then listen to Andra Day. Diana Ross sang the song she didn't render it like Billie Holiday when Andra Day sings that song she makes the effort to include the inflection and phrasing that Billie Holiday had in her vocal.Diana Ross was only nominated for a Golden Globe for her role but today Andra Day was nominated for a Golden Globe and also won it, there is the difference! In 1972 ''Lady Sings the Blues'' came in at the bottom of the Top Ten movies for that year grossing about $19,720,490 in North America to date bear in mind that the budget was $15,000,000 and to give some perspective the Top Movie for 1972 grossed $93,300,000.As for The United States vs Billie Holiday believe it or not the clue is in the title Billie Holiday was one of many prominent African Americans to be targeted by Edgar J. Hoovers F.B.I. yes, this is the subject of this period of Billie Holiday's life. It is not a biopic of her whole life a fact that Lee Daniels stated in the press before the release of the movie. One has written they couldn't watch the movie and turned it off? How can you review it then? Another writes it is only when Andra Day is on the screen that the film is lifted? Given that she is in the starring role I don't find this surprising? Another doesn't like the portrayal of Billie being a victim but she was a victim of the F.B.I. she was manipulated and ripped off by men in her life and no doubt beaten up on occasion. However, she had a hard life from childhood upwards in the time that she lived in America was an openly racist society but not just that it was a two-tier society and African Americans were right at the bottom of that second tier. Being born a woman from her sort of background in this time was yet another disadvantage she came from nothing achieved fame in this discriminately racist period her lifestyle was one of music which will more than likely put you in the proximity of alcohol and drugs it comes with the territory.As for the movie moving back and forth through time, this is not a new feature many other biopics are filmed in this way you won't find one that is 100% accurate Hollywood is known for embellishments to make the story more appealing to audiences so cut some slack and get real.For this movie to be currently given a score of 6.3 is disgraceful it's not perfect but I rate it at 8 out of 10 as one reviewer stated the music went on too long the film dragged missing the point that Billie was a musician and I agree with others here that the music throughout the film was nothing short of outstanding!","8","aalreetmarra"," Andra Day vs Diana Ross

"3411","I did actually learn some things about Billie Holiday that I didn't know, namely that her song ""Strange Fruit"" was an anthem for racial injustice and that the FBI used drugs as an excuse to relentlessly pursue her so that they could arrest her and keep her from performing, thereby depriving her the opportunity to incite black audiences. That is the actually very intriguing kernel around which this biopic is structured, but it's diluted by the hot mess of this film's screenplay, that spends far too much time on Holiday's tumultuous relationships with various men in her life.One of those men is FBI agent Jimmy Fletcher, who's assigned the task of following Holiday around and catching her out. He's black himself, and is subjected to the racial hierarchy within the department, so over time his allegiances switch to Holiday and he becomes her ally. Again, this is actually an interesting parallel story. But again, it's also diluted by everything else going on in this muddled movie.Why, for example, is the character of Talullah Bankhead and the possible lesbian relationship she had with Holiday even in the film? That story is introduced and literally goes nowhere, as if whole sections of the movie were edited out at the last minute. And why do all the white FBI agents have to be played as caricature villains, as if we won't sympathize enough with the black people unless the white people are as cartoonishly awful as possible. And why does the screenplay feel the need to have characters just tell us what the movie's themes are without allowing us to come to conclusions ourselves? At one point, a black character tells the worst of the FBI agents that the department hates Holiday because she's black and beautiful and threatening (or words to that affect), to which my response was, ""well duh.""And there are ridiculous sex scenes and lots of scenes of people using drugs and getting beat up and yelling and fighting. None of this bothered me because of the content, but rather because it all just becomes monotonous and traffics in the most tired of biopic tropes.Andra Day gives an impressive performance that stands as probably the film's biggest asset. The Academy got it right when they nominated her for an Oscar but chose not to reward anything else about the movie.Grade: B-","6","evanston_dad"," Did Learn Some Things

"3412","The united states vs Billie Holiday
2021
15
Director: Lee Daniels
Starring: Andra Day, Trevante Rhodes, Garrett Hedlund, Natasha Lyonne, Leslie Jordan, Miss Lawrence, etcOverall rating 67/100The united states vs Billie Holliday is about the legendary singer Billie Holliday (Andra Day), as we follow her career as she is targeted by the federal department of narcotics with an undercover sting operation led by black federal agent Jimmy Fletcher (Trevante Rhodes), with whom she has a tumultuous affair with. I have very mixed feeling on this film, there was some excellent moments but also an equal amount of frustratingly poor moments. Let's get started.My first few positives would be the powerful beginning, how likeable Billie was and the fantastic performances, the conflict being well set up with the government, as well as the great soundtrack. I thought that the beginning was really powerful and linked well with the message of the film and connected with billie really well, it was heart-breaking to see the poor judgement of people with colour and the barbaric behaviour of lynching's was awful, but it set up the tone and themes of the film really well and signified the importance of Billie as a person with her song strange fruit. I also thought that Billie Holliday was a very likeable person, despite being very flawed to the point of over dramatization in places (more on that in a future paragraph) Billie was unapolagetically herself, didn't take no crap from anyone and was an important symbol in the fight for racial equality, and when she was told to keep her mouth shut she did the complete opposite. I also have to praise Andra Day for her absolutely incredible performance, she was the best part of the film and completely deserved her Oscar nomination. Her performance was powerful, moving and charming and she bought Billie Holliday to life in such an incredible way and she stole every scene she was in I honestly couldn't keep my eyes off her. I also thought the conflict between Billie and the government was excellently done. When Billie was in her prime in the 40's and 50's there was unfortunately a lot of racial inequality still so therefore the government wanted her gone as she represented a change that they didn't want to see, It was horrifying to see them do everything in their power to get Billie arrested and target her, effecting her mental health in a very negative way, which also triggered some good conflict with Billie and her friends as she began to spiral out of control, you couldn't help but sympathise with her in parts. Finally, I also thought the soundtrack was excellent, Billie was an incredible artist, her voice was haunting, and her songs had so much power and meaning and represented a change in racial equality with strange fruit being a powerful song that was sung beautifully.My next few positives would be the strong dialogue, fantastic cinematography. As well as great character development and depth. I thought that the movie did an absolutely excellent job with its dialogue, it had some very moving lines that bought the character of Billie to life so well conveying her snappy and care free attitude well, as well as building tension and conflict effectively highlighting how white people talked down to and treated black people in the 40's. I also thought the cinematography was excellent, there was some really great set pieces and creative shots. I also really liked the creative blending of the black and white and found footage of Billie with the film I thought that was a really nice creative touch. I thought that the movie also had excellent character depth, Billie was a troubled soul and the more you learned about the more you understood why she turned to alcohol and drugs as a coping mechanism, her disturbing childhood, not feeling good enough or welcome anywhere, and her being constantly targeted by the government took a really negative toll on her and she used alcohol and drugs to take the pain and negative thoughts away, this was really moving especially in the second half of the move and as her character developed we began to understand her and her struggles.My first few negatives would be the lack of set up or explanation to certain characters, some unneeded scenes, an occasional emotional disconnect to the plot and characters and the odd characterisation of Billie. I thought the movie oddly set up a lot of characters with a lack of set up or explanation into who they actually were, this made the pacing very clunky, because it was often very confusing who the characters were, and it too often felt the film was just expecting you to know who the people were so just skipped straight into them being in a relationship with Billie for months. I also felt like there was a lot of unneeded scenes that just felt too much like filler, there was scenes that could of simply been cut as they served no purpose to the overall message of the film particular examples would have to be the funeral of Billie's dog and certain scenes with Billie's and fans. For me there was an occasional emotional disconnect to the film especially in the first half, it felt like the movie was undecided on how to depict Billie as a person. One minute the movie was aligning you with her and her cause, the next the movie almost turned against her making Billie seem horrible, cruel and a burden to her community with certain characters attacking her about her issues and forgetting the impact she had. This just felt like very odd and inconsistent characterisation for me and I struggled to connect with the film, this became more focused for her character in the second half but they still felt a bit divided on how people should see her.My final few positives would be the chemistry between the cast, the powerful themes on racism and emotional weight, the excellent building of tension and the powerful ending. I thought the whole cast had excellent chemistry with Andra Day and they bounced off each other really well, all of their friendships were fun and believable and gave the movie some much needed light hearted humour. I thought the movie tackled its themes on racism excellently, it really went into great depths in the divide of races and how black people were treated, and even when they were in the police like Jimmy was they were still being manipulated for their own gain. This made the movie had a lot of emotional weight as it was truly horrifying to watch the actions people took just because of a difference in skin colour, it was executed authentically and powerfully, and Billie's spiral into ill health was also very well done and emotional, as she never lost who she was, and her legacy still remained. I also thought the movie-built tension really well for a hard-hitting final act. As the allegations and attacks against Billie got bigger and bigger, I genuinely didn't know what was going to happen to her and the negative impact it had on her health, it was heart-breaking to watch but also powerfully done, with a had hitting ending that stayed true to who Billie was as a person and had important messages on racism and linking to the modern day as well.My final few negatives would be the lack of sympathy to characters due to the glorifying of drugs, the clunky structure and pacing issues. I thought that the film made it fairly hard to connect to Billie and the other characters and to sympathise with them, especially in the first half, the movie didn't really portray drugs as a bad thing or the cause of billie's declining health instead it was portrayed more casually and was obsessively used in normal situations with friends, this for me creates a bit of a lack of connection to the people involved, it happened too often and could have been handled much better. I also thought that the movie had an extremely clunky structure and really bad pacing issues, the movie felt very episodic and just felt like a series of big events in her life. There was nothing in between and the film often cut into scenes that we didn't have a clue what was happening, or spoon feeding us information in the dialogue that we could of seen for set up and context. This made the whole film feel very clunky and rush and was fairly poorly structured.Overall, despite a truly Oscar worthy performance from Andra Day, bringing Billie Holiday to life in a fascinating character study, and the film hitting all of the right notes with its themes on racism. It far to often gets trapped in its clunky structure, misguided characterisation of Billie and occasional bad handling of some deeper themes, that the film often looses itself and its authenticity, therefore making it not as strong as previous biopics.","6","rnixon-15663"," The United States vs Billie Holiday

"3418","The latest from Lee Daniels (Precious/The Butler), a Hulu original, focuses on the trials & tribulations of legendary singer Billie Holiday. Her song 'Strange Fruit' (a song about lynching) becomes the lightning rod for the FBI's interest, seen in the guise of a leading agent, played by Garrett Hedlund, to keep pressure on her (busting her for drug use or not allowing her proper artist credentials so she couldn't perform in certain venues), meanwhile not being the most savvy of bedfellows she would shack up w/men who would invariably take advantage of her (some even setting her up w/the authorities) or causing controversy when she pursued a same sex affair w/actress Tallulah Bankhead, played by Natasha Lyonne. Focusing on one undercover agent's, played by Moonlight's Trevante Rhodes, efforts to trip her up, he eventually sees the investigation for what it is & even ends up falling in love w/her. Played by Andra Day, in a remarkable performance (I believe she did all her own singing), Holiday is every bit of diva she makes herself out to be but also just as vulnerable, not knowing where a paycheck would be coming from even though she was always constantly in demand all around the world. For me this is probably Daniels best effort (I haven't warmed up to his output as of late) where his concerns & potent subject matter become a winning combination. Partnered w/the recent Billie documentary, both of these efforts give us a solid foundation of a woman most would consider the greatest R & B artist who ever lived. Also starring Tyler James Williams (from Everybody Hates Chris) as a member of Holiday's band, Rob Morgan as one of Holiday's husbands, Leslie Jordan (from Will & Grace) as an interviewer & surprisingly good is Miss Lawrence (from the Real Housewives of Atlanta) as a member of Holiday's entourage.","8","masonfisk"," A WOMAN & HER SAD SONG...!

"3419","Up until now I'd never heard of Andra Day but I watched this because she has been nominated for an Oscar for her performance and I can say it's totally justified. It's a fantastic portrayal of Billie Holiday , it's just a shame that the film itself doesn't live up to her billing .This follows Billie Holiday's during her career as she is targeted by the Federal Department of Narcotics with an undercover sting operation led by black Federal Agent Jimmy Fletcher, with whom she had a an affair.I have a few problems with this film . Firstly it feels that Andra Days performance is a little wasted in movie that is so misguided.It feels like a stage play at times and that it's formulaic process where we go from singing , to drug taking to FBI involvement over and over again gets extremely boring .The acting around Andes Day is average at best . Travante Rhodes who plays Jimmy Fletcher is unconvincing and Garrett Hedlund who plays Harry Anslinger is even less so . His mumbling would put Tom Hardy to shame and because of its problems it's feels way too long yet it's only just over two hours .It's good to learn about Billie Holiday and how badly she was treated by the US and to listen to her music but while the actual portrayal does her justice , sadly the film doesn't.","7","valleyjohn"," A Brilliant leading performance

"3420","I saw this film as a kick to remind, to large public, Billy Holiday. Because it is not exactly a film for her admirers but a sort of introduction, using a not so bad sketch of a moment of her life. At the end, it is easy to say - it is just a beautiful film. Because it is saved by the admirable job of Andra Day. She makes things rolling in this nice try but far to be what you honestly expect. Her performance is just the basic motif to not ignore this movie.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","Kirpianuscus"," Andra Day

"3423","It's unfortunate because some of my absolute favorite people in the industry worked on this film; Natasha Lyonne, Salaam Remi, Leslie Jordan. This movie was a hard watch, not because of the content but because it managed to make something that was interesting in real life, uninteresting. Another case of a story being brought to the big screen by the wrong hands. The film moves all over the place, it can't make up it's mind on what story it's trying to tell. We start off by seeing Billie Holiday (Andra Day) starting an interview with a gossipy southern radio host played by Leslie Jordan. I figured that would be the format the film would continue on with; everything she tells the interviewer gets shown on the screen as the film goes along. Needless to say, that's not what happened. The interview comes back here and there but it's not going in the order of what's happening.A lot of the scenes are tailored to show Andra Day's talents, the story gets lost in their focus to show her acting and singing chops. It worked, as she won the Golden Globe in the end, but in that case the film should have just been called ""Andra Day as Billie Holiday."" She's a good actress though and great singer, but I'm unsure if she truly caught Billie Holiday. Looks like she tapped into the idea of who we think Billie Holiday was rather than who the actual woman was. That's not her fault though, that's traced back to the directing and writing.As mentioned before, the movie can't pick what it wants to focus on. The movie is not exactly a biopic, it was supposed to focus on the U.S. Government's incessant attack on Billie Holiday due to her song ""Strange Fruit."" However, somewhere towards the end, the movie decides that it wants to be a biopic - showing her childhood, her first time trying heroin. It's done in vignettes, but it was one of many things in this film that felt unnecessary. The audience understands what the song ""Strange Fruit"" is about from the start of the film, but they really want to bring the point home with those vignette scenes. The poor dialogue doesn't help either, a lot of it is expositiony. I guess to put it best, the film doesn't trust its audience is smart enough to know what's going on so they have the characters tell you.There's a lot of singing scenes, which is a given since it's a Billie Holiday film, but they go on to the point that they're almost like music videos. There's a lot of sex and shooting up scenes than necessary. Some scenes happen that aren't relevant to the story happen as well. I can't stress enough how messy this film is, it got tangled up in its own hype. By that I mean, you can tell the director thought he had created some unapologetically raw masterpiece but he was so caught up in his own self grandeur that the movie got lost.Maybe someday we'll get a proper film about Billie Holiday, sadly this one is not it. I recommend it solely to see Andra Day's performance because in the end, that's the only thing the film focused on and that's all it has to offer.","4","stefstars"," Andra Day Can't Carry The Whole Movie

There were too many montage sequences in my opinion that took away from the film. The content examined in this version was too risky for the previous Berry Gordy production at that time.

"3434","The Life of jazz singer Billie Holiday brought to life through an impressive performance by Andra Day. A drug addict, a woman of great courage and determination who challenged the US anti Narcotics dept tasked by the Govt to put her down by jailing her.

Till her death she took a defiant stand and refused to cow down to FBI agents.The film is made well and Andra Day carries it splendidly on her shoulders. Her acting also improves as the film develops and the ending scenes see her emoting superbly.Lee Daniels's direction is admirable. He has captured the atmosphere well but his big achievement is in getting Andra Day to do a fabulous job.

She works every word in the miserable script with nuance and a wealth of emotion worthy of a blues singer. Her performance of Strange Fruit is as haunting as the song.The movie itself, what a hot mess. Let me count thy ways:
A jumble of scenes that seem oddly sequenced.The point of the movie (the government stopping at no means to keep Holiday from singing Strange Fruit, a protest song against lynching,) is so dumbed down it takes away from the true evil of what's happening.We don't get to see more of Holiday's childhood and how those experiences shaped her drug use and future abusive relationships since they're key to the story.Billie Hol","4","claddagh72"," 4 stars for Andra Day only

"3443","The film was solid at best. It is very inconsistent and often dry. The directional skills of Lee Daniels are definitely visible because there were some great creative ways he put scenes or mid-scenes in place but the film lacks on the storyteller side. I am not sure if it was the screenplay or that Daniels was more intersted in style. What stands out is without any doubt the performance of Andra Day. And that is also where Lee Daniels triumphs - in his loveletter to Billie Holiday because there is no doubt he perfectly put the character and Andra Day in scene. Day's (basically) debut performance is really astonishing. She puts a lot of strenghts and emotion into that role. Making it raw but loveable. Making it real. The film kind of reminds me on Le Vie en Rose when a solid - to weak - film showcasts a fantastic performance.
Besides Day there is also Trevante Rhodes who finally gets ar role again. A very underrated actor who deserves much more roles and acclaim.

Despite the voice, music, and talented messages Mrs. Holiday endured pain and pressure thru life. The time period spotlighted is Billie's fame height of the 1940's, who at the time was a target of the federal government for the performance of her song ""Strange Fruit"", a song that condemned lynching. Watching the film you feel the emotions and pressure while possible riots loam, and it's like one rides the journey of a civil rights march.

"3462","It was not the worst movie I have ever seen, but the plot was incredibly dumb. The utterly ridiculous premise about super-assassins being sent to kill each other, or just one, while they operate without any clue regarding evidence, DNA or other real world issues. Also, the entire premise of hiring an assassin then making them guess who the target is seems pretty stupid. What assassin would take such a job, and what idiot pays money to maybe have the wrong person(s) killed?The plot holes are enormous.The premise of the movie is that the Virtuoso is a professional assassin who is remorseful for an accidental killing. His Mentor, for whatever reason, decides he needs to be dead, but instead of just killing him when he had ample opportunity, the Mentor devises a complex scheme whereby 4 killers are sent on a mission to kill *someone* for *some reason*. Each other? Just him?In the near-final scene where the Virtuoso meets his killer, they discuss inane issue. The *Deputy* could not be made to look like he was killed by bad guys because he had the real Deputy's body in the trunk of the Sheriff's vehicle. The police would not overlook that when investigating the fake Deputy's death.The guy who had a heart attack induced had several fake ID's in his wallet, leaving only one at random would not fool police into thinking he was just some poor schmuck, it would, they would discover it was fake, he had a gun, etc. Hilarity ensues.The final living killer is just as nonsensical as he is. Apparently, to the writer, getting away with murder is a common and easy experience requiring very little in way of not leaving evidence. She has sex with the Virtuoso, which makes no sense if she knows she will kill him, takes a shower allowing the Virtuoso to find her passport and figure out who she is. She then kills him after their ridiculous *one-professional-killer-to-another* conversation, goes to his house, feeds his dog and and nearly shoots it but changes her mind.The plot makes me wonder which one of the actors read it and thought ""that is possible and could happen in real life, I would like to be a part of this.""Donnie Darko is not real, but it isn't supposed to be, and is an entertainment masterpiece. The Virtuoso is supposed to be something that could happen in real life, is a trainwreck of unrealistic logic and events, and generally is not very good.Plus the ending sucked. They could have ended it like the Mechanic, where he died but everyone else also gets killed by his revengeful nature.","4","jaimegonzales210"," Entertaining, but dumb

A 5th grader could've written a better screenplay. It had plot and technical issues galore. There were scenes that where irrelevant and/or made no sense. It was predictable. It was implausible. It was ridiculous. And you can't just use the word ""noir"" as an excuse to describe this mess. The 110 runtime was excessive for the little substance the story had, and the slow pacing got to the point of making this film annoying to watch.The cinematography and performances were the only somewhat redeeming qualities. Sad to say this film doesn't do Hopkins any favors on his resume. It's a very generous 3/10 from me.","3","Top_Dawg_Critic"," The most boring, convoluted, incoherent nonsense hitman story ever written.

"3470","Replace the thoughts of the characters, it'd be a disastrous wrong step to start a movie; it's so lame and so lazy to use such stupid method to almost every scene and setting in this movie.Besides, Anson Mount, who played the Virtuoso role, was not an ideal pick for it. Mount still implemented his aura when he played the fierce character in ""Hell on Wheels"" as totally inappropriate. A hitman or assassin should not show his intensity everytime when he was in a social contact with the common people. He just looked so different and stand out among regular people, he didn't blend in but a rooster among hens; that's an absolute NO NO in the first place. He's so intense and looked so obviously intense with animosity to others, only made him look so unprofessional. Then again, signed up Abbie Cornish to play the diner's waitress was another misstep unforgivable, but even so, she's more looked like a seasoned virtuoso than Mount, who played it. But Cornish really has to watch out her weight, it seems a bit of out of control and readily to explode. Hawkins, well, this movie got to borrow some heavy wt. Actor to fool viewers to think that this movie would be great, but not in the least. He's not a magician or savior to salvage a terrible screenplay with limited budget for a B movie and, I'd guess a large part of the budget was paid to him for his participation. As to Mr. Mount, your performance was just too 1 dimensional, you couldn't just bring your Hell on Wheels characteristics into any other roles you played. You're a handsome dude, but it could only bring you so far.Summary: Don't waste your time like I did; don't bother.","1","housearrestedever"," Once you decided to use voice over to

Not only that but the accident I saw on the screen probably would have a 95% chance of survival for the driver. The 2nd hit is just a code name, a location and a time. He has no idea who he's supposed to off so he has to go around asking everyone he meets if they've heard of this code name? Are you kidding me? And even then, the ""code name"" is meaningless.

Instead they played the story out in various locations and the movie lost all its potential.The woman has a nice nude scene but that alone is not enough to recommend this movie. Out of respect for Anthony Hopkins' past roles and the 10 minutes he gets in this movie I won't say anything about his performance. If it was any other actor I would have trashed him.

"3476","Greetings again from the darkness. It seems to this casual observer that once a person makes the career decision to become a hitman (or hitwoman or hitperson), their life expectancy drops significantly, as does their willingness to trust any person they meet, or at least it should. After all, the industry of killing is all about death ... it's simply a matter of whether (this time) you are the one doing the killing, or the one being killed. This neo-noir comes courtesy of writer-director Nick Stagliano (his first feature film in 10 years) and co-writer James C Wolf.Anson Mount (so good in the ""Hell on Wheels"" TV series) is the titular Virtuoso. In typical noir fashion, he's also our narrator, and serves up a detailed explanation of his approach to the profession. He's methodical and meticulous in his precision and planning, and goes about his business in a professional manner, while maintaining a low profile and adhering to his own code. He even practices his facial expressions in the mirror preparing for the rare social interaction (it's funnier than it sounds). He does jobs for The Mentor (newly crowned Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins), a former military friend of his dad. Their minimal communication usually involves a name on a scrap of paper. The first job we witness is a ""rush"" job and collateral damage leaves Virtuoso burdened with guilt - something that is not an asset in this line of work.It's the second job that takes up most of the run time. The Mentor provides only ""White Rivers"" as a hint to the identity of the target, and instructs him to be at the only diner in a place that barely exists as a town. Walking in, he sizes up those in the diner: The Waitress (Abbie Cornish, excellent as Fanny Brawne in BRIGHT STAR, 2009), The Loner (Eddie Marsan, ""Ray Donovan""), Handsome Johnnie (Richard Brake), and Johnnie's Girl (Diora Baird). A bit later, the local Deputy (David Morse) is added to the list of possible targets.The set-up is fun, and meant to keep us striving to stay one step ahead. Chris Perfetti adds a touch of humor in his two quick scenes as the motel desk clerk, and much of the tete a tete comes courtesy of the Virtuoso and The Waitress. Of course as with most noirs, we viewers figure out what's going on long before the hero, as the distractions are many. The budding romance offers up some seedy motel lovemaking, and the Virtuoso has an unusual living arrangement in his cabin in the woods. In other words, there are some excellent elements in play here, and it's difficult to pinpoint why the film doesn't play a bit better than it does. Mostly it just lacks the suspense delivered by the best in the genre.","6","ferguson-6"," Anson and Abbie

"3483","I am a huge fan of Anthony Hopkins. I predicted he would win an Oscar for ""The Father"" 2020 two months before the Academy Awards. He is an phenomenal actor. So it pains me to score a film he is in a 1 out of 10.What bothered me were monotonous robotic voiceover narrator. It sounds like Audible book-reading voiceover. During the diner scene when Abbie Cornish (The Waitress) brings over a carafe of fresh coffee to the table were Anson Mount (The Virtuoso) is sitting, I wanted to reach for the carafe myself. Wrong table darling Abbie, bring it here.The voiceover delivery is cringey and ruins the story. Because most of the actors were talking in this fashion, the director had to be to blame. This film has some excellent actors. Yet they all deliver their lines in a synthetic audible robot monotone. I sort of understand what the director was going after, but it didn't work. It didn't have the comedic feel to it. A focus group should have tested out this film before it was released.Another thing, to say this film was completely predictable is an understatement. This film began its downward spiral from the opening scene. What was the director thinking using this type of delivery with seasoned actors? You cannot do this bad a job with Sir Anthony Hopkins and Eddie Marsan on your cast! How did you mess this up? Wow, just umm, WOW. Even amateur hidden-cam porn has better sex scenes than this film.

"3487","The Virtuoso (2021) Dir. Nick Stagliano
Movies about hit men there are many. What is interesting here is the use of the protagonist's voice-over that shows us his skill, efficiency, intelligence, meticulousness and amorality to kill in cold blood. He calls himself ""Virtuous"" in the killing trade.The first 15 minutes are great. The voice-over sets the murderer's introspective and melancholic tone. A very good guy at what he does that shows a certain fatigue and a nascent guilt for some ""collateral damage"" in his murderous career and for the low-profile life that his job forces him to lead. Followed by a remarkable monologue of the character played by Anthony Hopkins recounting a massacre in which he participated in his days as a soldier in the Vietnam War. A reflection on how coldness and amorality is brewed in people who make the death of others their way of life.He is assigned a somewhat uncertain mission in which he does not know exactly the person he must eliminate. This leads him to a restaurant in a small town nestled in the mountains.A waitress, an older man, a couple, and a policeman.Who of them is his target? Being a guy who goes through life like a wolf in sheep's clothing, he will have to use all of his experience and insight against people who also camouflage his identity and intentions.A game of false appearances that shows that even the most cold and calculating people are prone to moments of vulnerability.Interesting reflection on the '' virtuous '' in the art of killing, who refuse to surrender completely to the brief flashes of love that cross their paths and the vicious circle of loneliness in which they are trapped.","8","javierbaron2008"," The '' virtuoso '' in the art of killing

"3516","The Movie plot had many holes, only grace was Anthony Hopkins performance, fresh from his recent academy win. Was looking forward to it.But, eventhough there was a slight chance of making it into a gripping take deception and revenge. It was unsatisfying to say the least that the protagonist was too smart yet gets outsmarted in the end...
Either way the movie could've been a moving story.Half baked:/","5","kumarorrakesh247"," Half Baked....

"3517","The Hitman or the Virtuoso (Anson Mount) receives his orders from his Mentor (Anthony Hopkins).The movie opens with a sex scene with the Hitman watching from another building and he fires a rifle bullet that kills the man. Next we see another hit, but it has to look like an accident. The Hitman's next assignment is for someone called White Rivers and he has no idea who that is.In the beginning we hear a narrative coming from the Hitman, who needs to tell himself to be careful, don't rush and well you get the idea. I liked the narrative because I am thinking along with him to make sure he doesn't overlook anything. This is cool. Of course, nothing is overlooked. Okay, we knew that.He ends up at a diner at exactly 5pm, the time he was told to be there. He sees a man at a table by himself, a couple at another table and in comes the Deputy (David Morse). The Pretty Waitress (Abbie Cornish) tries to enter a conversation with the Hitman, but he comes away with nothing.Notables: Eddie Marsan, The Loner at the table by himself, and is he packing?; Richard Brake and Diora Baird, the couple at another table, and are they packing? Chris Perfetti as the Motel Clerk; Anthony Hopkins as the Mentor and who can be better at it than Mr. Hopkins?; Abbie Cornish as the Waitress is still very beautiful and a very good actress.Yes, this is very slow going, but we need it to be that way. We need to be as cautious and as watchful as the Hitman. The Hitman's mark is White Rivers, and he needs to scout around to get more clues to find out who that is. Yes, there will be a twist. Isn't there always?If you recall in the past, I have said that Hitmen or Assassins usually state and follow the rules they must obey and live by. However, at the end of almost every Hitman or Assassin story he will break every rule he has. Will this happen to this Hitman? Let's find out.For me, this is a very enjoyable Hitman story. Anson Mount is perfect in this role. The Hitman knows he acts like a robot and when you see him make faces in a mirror maybe he's trying to be human after all. Ha! (7/10)Violence: Yes.Sex: Yes.Nudity: Yes.Humor: No.Language: Yes, not a lot though.Rating: B.","7","itsbobr"," Good Hitman Story

"3521","Movie started well, very well actually, enough to keep me interested until the end, but the constant holes on the script and incoherent mistakes for a ""Virtuoso"" kinda ruined it.Anson Mount plays the lead role wonderfuly and I keep wondering why this guy is not chosen for more movies (even for the ""The Witcher"" series he would be on par with ""Mr. Superman"" on the character).With such good actors in, It was a surprise to not see Anthony Hopkins playing a more meaningful role on the story.It was the great beginning and middle that kept me to the end. It was the good acting and noir looks that kept me interested and trying to ignore the obvious mistakes the main character was doing.All in all, could be much better, but compared to the movie trash that is coming out lately, this is almost a masterpiece - and could have been if more character build-up was in and more plot-holes were out.","6","davish_wulf-1"," Watchable but gets worse towards the 3/4

"3525","The Virtuoso has a ""twin peaks"" vibe. The narration style gives this movie added depth and humour. This movie is a dark comedy and I think this is why some viewers did not understand/like it. Abbie Cornish is one of the most beautiful women in the world and one of the most compelling actors. Anson Mount is the next big thing. Anson stars in Star Trek's new ""Stranger Worlds"" and captures the role of an ""autistic"", cold blooded killer whose humanity is beginning to seep through very well in The Virtuoso. Anthony Hopkins, Wow .. Enough said. This is a great movie and I hope that there is a part 2.","10","miguelitos"," Watch this movie as a Dark Comedy

"3529","Having read the book I was super excited about the movie ! But alas it was a disappointment. The movie felt like more of a drama than an intriguing thriller like it was in the book. The dialogues sometimes were over the top and the pace lagging, the supporting actors only show up when it's convenient to keep the plot moving. Sadly there is nothing interesting about any one of them. Expect for Moore she nailed her part.Even the two biggest reveals of the story seemed lacklustre. There was a lot of buildup throughout but it just fell flat in the end.Keeping all the negativity aside Amy as always did a great job.","5","cafeosh"," Even Amy couldn't save it.

"
"3531","I was SO looking forward to this movie, but was disappointed because many key points from the book were missing! I think that the things they left out would have clarified and explained a lot of the behaviors of Anna and Ethan. For example, they showed the car crash, but didn't talk about the fact that Anna was stranded for days in that storm, watching her family die (which was the cause of her agoraphobia and PTSD). We kind of saw Anna and Ethan's relationship, but it wasn't really believable. We weren't shown enough of their relationship to understand how Ethan manipulated Anna into trusting him and believing he was the victim. The movie also completely skimmed over the details of the guesswhoanna account, (how it was Ethan on Anna's computer but Anna, being under the influence of the meds and alcohol, thought that she had created and sent the emails to herself).... and the movie didn't even mention Anna's conversation with her online ""friend"" (who ended up actually being Ethan). Oh, and then there was Bina, Anna's friend..... I could go on and on.If they had included more details from the book, sure, the movie might have been longer, but it would have made more sense. It definitely would have been a LOT more intense and mind-blowing, like the book was.","5","jasiegirl"," Missed key points from the book!!!

"3533","This is the example of movies with big budgets that allow them to have a lot of possibilities, but sometimes a lot is not the best for a movie. Without a doubt Rear Window from 1954 comes to mind and I can only say that Alfred Hitchcock won since with much less he provides us with the suspense that The Woman In The Window lacked. I must say that I am a fan of Joe Wright movies and this is not at his level, it will not change the perception I have of him as a filmmaker because I want to think that the decisions that hurt the film were not made by him (based on some productions by Scott Rudin) so I'll pretend I never looked at it. I also have to mention that the best thing was the music, excellently achieved by Danny Elfman where he takes us on a journey of horror classics, exactly what the movie dealt with in many ways but with mediocre results, I can't wait to listen to it in full and enjoy the heartbreaking cry of the violins.","3","alejandro-bonilla"," Without a doubt Rear Window from 1954 comes to mind and I can only say that Alfred Hitchcock won.

"3536","From the release delays to the bad word of mouth, I was expecting this to be a trainwreck of a movie. Instead, what I got was a perfectly enjoyable suspense thriller. Sure, it's has it's flaws, the first half seems rushed, and some actors were underutilized (Jennifer Jason Leigh in particular) but I did not see that final twist coming - a twist that actually made sense.I have not read the book, but even if I had it's only fair to judge this as a separate piece of work - because it is. So even if the book WAS better, it's got nothing to do with this piece of entertainment to me for they are two completely different experiences.

"3543","Starts out as Rear Window, has a Shutter Island plot twist in the middle, ends as a combination of Rear Window and The Girl On The Train. Probably several things went wrong in the production and the script was probably modified several times. Some top actors like Gary Oldman and Anthony Mackie play pretty insignificant roles. The film just feels off and when the final twist arrives you're like ""that's it...?"". The last 10 minutes of the movie is literally spend on the main character leaving the house and taking a taxi. I understand that this is important because the character finally dares to go outside, but you as a viewer will not be interested by then.

They clearly did not read the book or watch the trailer to see the style the movie was taking before watching.Personally I loved the style of the film, the colour pallette and the set. It absolutely lived up to the book in my opinion- it's completely unrealistic to expect every detail from a novel to be included in a 2 hour film, anything that was left out did not effect the storyline.The performances were great all round, the only negative I can say is that there weren't enough scenes/screen time with the side characters- however this may be down to the extensive reshoots and reworking the film went through.I loved the ending, it really gave the feeling of a classic horror/thriller but through a more modern lense.I highly recommend this movie, think people are being unreasonably harsh and bitter.","8","ShanC22"," Satisfying adaptation of a great book

"3571","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Ben Falcone and Melissa McCarthy, husband and wife, have been making movies together since the former began his filmmaking career. Literally, every film directed, written, and/or produced by Falcone has the famous actress in the lead role, all exploring subgenres of comedy. From romance (Superintelligence) to crime (The Happytime Murders), without forgetting a road trip (Tammy), now comes the time for Thunder Force, a dive into the highly profitable superhero circle. However, I don't believe the couple's real goal is to deliver a globally liked movie. Actually, I firmly defend that their purpose is to provide the most nonsensical piece of storytelling possible, hoping that viewers find it entertaining enough.Directors, screenwriters, actors, and every other crew member... a vast majority aspire to deliver a groundbreaking masterpiece. A film recognized by everyone as ""remarkable cinema"". Something worthy of many Oscars, Golden Globes, and much more. Movies like Thunder Force aren't made to receive regular nominations, but instead, to try and be present at the Razzies - both Falcone and McCarthy have been quite successful in this achievement. While the actress continuously shows her undeniable talent that would be better employed in other films - such as Can You Ever Forgive Me? And Bridesmaids - the writer-director continues to put together awfully dull movies.To be completely honest, the first act of Thunder Force is surprisingly decent. The setup to the main narrative is interesting enough, and the comedy peak is reached during the first half-hour. The massive problem is that this peak offers no more than a couple of chuckles occasionally. From the start of the second act until the very end, Falcone embarrassingly fails to offer genuine laughs. The tone is ridiculously out-of-balance, with almost every scene being a forced attempt at humor, even when the moment doesn't ask for it. Incredibly flat - and some disgusting - jokes are repeated throughout the film, which ends up dragging an already stretched out runtime.The superhero plot is as generic and predictable as it could be in a movie that makes no effort in trying to do something remotely different than what viewers have seen for the last couple of decades. The VFX look like they came from an amateur studio as if Netflix didn't even care about its own product. Story-wise, there's not even a proper way of analyzing such a silly screenplay. In one moment, it seems to be taking a specific scene seriously, but a couple of minutes later, everything is back to the annoyingly dumb environment. Don't get me wrong: if there's a type of humor I absolutely adore is absurd comedy, but it needs to be done properly, with the right people and the right story.In the end, I usually tend to have a light hand in films like this. Thunder Force is just another addition to the never-ending list of ""forgettable movies"", which isn't something that really bothers me. It's exactly what everyone expects it to be, which can work as a compliment if people want to. The most frustrating aspect of all of this is watching McCarthy and Octavia Spencer - two outstanding actresses with five Oscar nominations combined, including a win for the latter in The Help - working on hopeless projects such as this one. It begs the famous question: why?Thunder Force is yet another piece of pointless, absurd storytelling from Ben Falcone, featuring unbearably dry, forced humor, besides a forgettable story. A film that cross-checks every requirement for a Razzies contender, something quite familiar for the writer-director and his wife, Melissa McCarthy, who keeps doing favors. Despite an admittedly decent first act, the rest of the film goes downhill concerning its entertainment value. Honestly, I don't know what's worse: witnessing McCarthy and Octavia Spencer waste her exceptional talent in nonsensical movies or seeing major studios continue to give opportunities to filmmakers that have nothing important to say while necessary, significant voices are still out there waiting desperately for their shot. The best compliment I can give this Netflix product is that it doesn't mislead anyone: it's precisely what viewers expect it to be, whether that's nice or horrible.Rating: D.","3","msbreviews"," Thunder Force is yet another piece of pointless, absurd storytelling from Ben Falcone, featuring unbearably dry, forced humor, besides a forgettable story.

They don't.Special effects are pretty good.Around the halfway point I realised it wasn't going to go anywhere and I started to get bored.For me, the big saving grace and the reason for my 5 star rating is Jason Bateman.

Melissa McCarthy and Husband Ben Falcone who also directed and wrote the film have been on another track record of making atrocious comedy films. Which the humor has been the same in all there films. Boring cheesy dialogue. Terrible humor that delivers more eye rolls than laughs. Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer were unfunny. Jason Bateman playing a Crab handed character also seemed bored with the role.The plot following people having superhero powers. A corrupt mayor who has his hidden agenda. While Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer team up with super strength to stop the bad guys.Terrible cgi. Cheesy dialogue. Boring action. And the humor is terrible.

"
"3610","Long Answer: Definitely not. You don't have to read this review because it's just not worth it.First of all, Melissa McCarthy's character (I'm too lazy to call her by her name so we'll call her Melissa) tries to pull of the ""village idiot"" stunt in the most embarassing way, and comes off selfish and almost bully-like to Octavia Spencer's character. She also makes fun of nerds/ ""smart"" people, even to Octavia's daughter which is a really boring and overused trope. At some point she even feels entitled to know about Octavia's life (such as the existence of her daughter) even though Melissa was the one who cut Octavia off.The ""jokes"" in this movie are objectively unfunny, and run off for far too long. One example is a joke near the beginning of the movie between Melissa and some cafe owner who she's friends with, and the cafe guy makes a weird error in his speech and he keeps trying to make joke after joke about it, but it just comes off so awkward. Not to mention the ""dweebish"" character that is supposedly a victim of Melissa's bullying. He purposely fails at comedy, but it just doesn't make him any better. The only good gag in this movie we get is when Octavia's character gets the easier treatment while Melissa gets the painful treatment. But they can't even get that right because Octavia immediately gets a hold of her powers and that's it.The logic and plot in this movie is frustrating. The villian is PAINFULLY obvious, I even got the double crosser on the first try. If you decide to watch the movie, I don't even have to spoil it for you because it's just that obvious. Also, every single person in this movie is hilariously not smart, even though there are 2 smart characters in this movie. No one bothers to get decent security to keep Melissa from getting poweres, the bad guys miss the good guys even though they could totally just kill them, and oh gosh the ending which I'll get to after the next part.My least favorite part of the movie is the raw chicken bit and crab man! Melissa has to fight against a crab man robber and just flirts with him? Also he goes ""you can't kill us, that would make you bad!"" as if arrest wasn't an option. But yeah, Melissa just uses the seduction technique. Later on they both confess that they like raw chicken and, oh gosh, that's sort of where the ending ties in!The ending is meh. The villain wants to blow up a building cool, but then the two girls just rush in and wowsers, they nearly lose until Octavia's ""nerdy"" (thanks for that Melissa) daughter suddenly gets super speed and helps! Melissa tosses the villain and the last threat they have is a bomb. The daughter offers to run with the bomb so it doesn't blow up the building but apparently it's not ""stable"". Ok? Then Melissa just offers to do it. But one important thing she says before that is ""We can't just throw it out the window, it'll hurt people!"". Think really carefully, then throw your thoughts out the window because they aren't needed here. Melissa jumps out the WINDOW with the BOMB. See the problem? Also not to mention there was a large body of water outside of the window, the effect would've been the same!!! I really thought the ending was bad until...The crab man and Melissa start feeding each other raw chicken, mouth to mouth. I think I'm not gonna eat crab or chicken for like until I forget this movie exists, which should take about a week. Anyways if you thought you wanted to see this movie, good for you but I thought the same thing and I was completely wrong.","1","charlotteweb-43346"," Is this movie worth watching? Quick Answer: No.

Melissa did her best, Bateman was entertaining, and Pom Klementieff stood out as having the most gusto for her role.

It was almost as though they felt that if they stretched a single awkward scene on for long enough, then it would eventually become funny. It doesn't. It just gets more awkward.A waste of some good talent (Octavia Spencer and Jason Bateman) on a movie that should never have got past a drunken pitch (nobody sober could have thought this was a good script).It's a shame because if handled well, the base premise could have worked.Avoid.","1","harmony_of_the_void"," Managed 30 Painful minutes

"3665","Positives:
I laughed three times:o Jason Bateman's ""Crab-man"" talking about his ironic star-sign;
o Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy's love-making scene: the most
innovative use of butter since ""Last Tango in Paris""!O The duo struggling to get in and out of their Lamborghini supercar: purely
because it looks just like me these days trying to get in and out of my wife's
Mazda MX5!Negatives:
It singularly fails my ""six laughs"" test for a comedy. The script by Ben Falcone - McCarthy's husband - is just eye-rollingly unfunny. The pair must have laughed themselves silly over their own jokes. It's just a shame that their sense of humour diverges so wildly from mine (or indeed anyones?)Melissa McCarthy must be an acquired taste - one I've never acquired. ""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" proves what a class act she can be.... but this does her reputation no good at all.It's criminal to have actors of the quality of Octavia Spencer, Jason Bateman and Melissa Leo and use them in such a poor way. Bateman is actually the funniest turn in the piece, but that's not saying much.Summary Thoughts on ""Thunderforce"":
There are some movies that you just wish had been drowned at birth. This is one. I normally don't regret spending two hours watching a movie, but this one felt like wasted time. With ""Twist"" I thought I might have found my worst film of the year.

"3666","Yet another film where all the ""good-guys"" are female and/or black and all the ""bad-guys"" or idiots or just plain dislikables are white and/or male.From the school bully (even though one of the protagonists is also a bully) being a white boy to the hero's company only employing women (except for the token black male assistant).Some of my favourite films have very strong heroes who are female or black, and they are naturally inclusive - like The Hunger Games: fully inclusive with a female lead in Katniss Everdeen but where everyone - black, white, male, female and disabled - have a role to play and nothing feels forced, unlike so many recent films, including this.SOme funny moments but they were too far and too few between.","2","tovarishchshevchenko"," If you want forced inclusivity...

I will simply say if you are looking to shut your brain pan off for an hour and 46 minutes, you could do worse that Thunder Force. McCarthy should go back to TV and Octavia please be a bit more selective. There were a few funny lines but overall, the usual Melissa McCarthy humor. On a side note I had nacho's and the crunching made some of the dialog incoherent so I had that going for me.If you like Melisa McCarthy watch Identity Thief, She and Jason Bateman will keep you laughing in that one.","4","Fitzy14"," Thunder Force More Like Thunder Thud

"3705","Plus-sized women now get to see themselves in a superhero film, which is good for them and doubly so for the Internet-dwellers who now have another piece of ""progressive propaganda"" to use as a punchline. Thunder Force is one of those films where everyone gets to win.One wonders, however, if the supposed target audience is pleased that fat representation so often entails Amy-Schumerian juvenilia and gross faces. This is probably done to upset fatphobic viewers (especially the misogynists who'd sooner die than accept the simple fact that there exist more body types than ""thin"") but I wouldn't be surprised if someone took offense at the ""Look how big and gross I am"" routine. Roger Ebert thought Paul Blart was a positive portrayal of fat men, so what do I know?In the movie, Melissa McCarthy (Who else?) and Octavia Spencer star as two childhood friends reunited when the superpowered Miscreants begin to terrorize Chicago more than usual and someone must retaliate. These supervillains have been around since a cosmic-ray blast in the 1980s that somehow only targeted sociopaths, but Spencer's character has discovered a way to imbue the normies and muggles of the city with superpowers.When McCarthy visits, she accidentally gets a dose of Spencer's experimental drug and so becomes strong enough to rival Mr. Incredible, while Spencer has the power of invisibility. As they develop their skills, their main foe becomes the mayoral candidate ""The King"" (Bobby Cannavale), who commands the Miscreants to create anarchy and make the populace vote for him.Of the two leads, McCarthy seems the most comfortable; films of this genre, tone, and level of intelligence are what she's used to (Can You Ever Forgive Me? Being one of the very few exceptions, proving she can find work through other avenues than her writer-director husband). Spencer, meanwhile, has many respectable roles under her belt (ranging from the uncomfortably honest The Help to the fantastical Shape of Water) and her performance creates the sense that she thinks this drivel is beneath her. Consequently, I don't particularly buy their friendship.Like many modern star-driven comedies, there is plenty of improv in-between and during the story checkpoints. Some critics have praised this aspect but when I think of great comedic ad-libbing, I think of George C. Scott falling over in Dr. Strangelove and immediately getting back up, even more energized than before. I don't think of movies like this, where comedians are essentially placed in front of the camera and poked with a stick.The plot itself is so formulated and non-special that it's aggressive. We've seen plenty of buddy films and girl-power superhero flicks go through these very motions before and countless films across cinema use these types of jokes. Did I laugh at anything? Well, I smirked when McCarthy threw a bus into the sky because the effect looked kinda funny to me (even though the bottom of the vehicle was practical and craned above the actress' head). Does that count?I do have a soft spot for Pom Klementieff, who plays one of The King's most formidable underlings. Jason Bateman is fine as Crab Man and I don't doubt that some of the interludes where the actors are just goofing around off-script will make someone out there crack a smile. That's about as positive as I will get today.","3","TheVictoriousV"," Idiotic; a generic addition to every genre it attempts
"
"3706","IN A NUTSHELL:
Yep, it's been 5 minutes so that means it's time for another superhero movie. But wait, this one is different. The idea behind this Netflix story is decent, but the execution is, sadly, lacking. Melissa McCarthy is married to the writer/director, Ben Falcone, who admitted this was the fastest he had ever written a film...and it shows. He exclaimed that he loves comics and superheroes, so it's a shame that he couldn't spend more time creating an actual decent script. You're going to laugh a couple of times during the action-comedy, but you'll also roll your eyes in the many cringe-worthy moments of this disappointing movie...THINGS I LIKED:
Melissa McCarthy is hilarious and I really love her, but whenever she stars in movies that her husband writes and directs, the films tend to bomb. In this movie, she shines doing her classic physical humor but the script is a big mess.Some have speculated why Academy Award-winning Octavia Spencer would agree to this role; however, she and Melissa McCarthy have been friends in real life for 20 years. I'm assuming she just wanted to try something very different and lend her high-status name to the production. She and Melissa McCarthy also both showcase their daughters in this film. Melissa also featured her daughter, Vivian Falcone, in the movie The Boss.Melissa Leo also won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 2011, but has a very small role in this film.Some of the banter is pretty entertaining.Jason Bateman is always funny, although his character in this film is pretty bizarre. I thought he and Melissa McCarthy were pretty magical together in the movie Identity Thief.I don't think I had ever seen French actress Pom Klementieff without her green makeup and antennae as Mantis from Guardians of the Galaxy (Theatrical), (I LOVE that franchise!), so it took me a minute to realize she was the one playing the character Laser.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
I had done a trailer reaction for this film a while ago and thought the trailer looked pretty funny with some potential. Of course, knowing a little bit about the film's writer/director made me worry just a bit, so I had my fingers crossed. Unfortunately, my concerns were justified. The film is just completely disappointing on so many levels.You don't need X-ray vision to see what's going to happen next.The villains and their powers are pretty lame.A lot of the humor doesn't land at all and is extremely juvenile. A lot of it is improvisation, which simply didn't work, nor entertain.The character development isn't well defined.The first half of the movie takes way too much time to show us how Melissa McCarthy gets superpowers and we wonder if there is going to be anything more to the schtick. She kind of plays the same character in every movie, so this character just felt worn out much of the time.So much exposition.There are some super-gross moments regarding raw chicken when people eat it. It's supposed to be funny, but it's not. Even worse is that it goes on and on forever. The good news is that the actors were NOT actually eating raw chicken, but a carefully camouflaged Asian pear. Whew! Rumor has it that even knowing it was pieces of Asian pear, the actors still had a hard time eating it in their scenes. Yuck.You can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!As much as I like Octavia Spencer, she seemed like a real fish out of water in this comedy and, at times, seemed to be phoning in it. At the end of the movie, there is a celebration scene where she just kind of stands there, not even knowing what to do.The movie actually looks low-budget.The special effects are not very good.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

"3715","I'll admit, I went in expecting a terrible script that some drunk Netflix executive green lit, banking solely on McCarthy's comedic fame to get viewers. The first ten or so minutes seemed to prove me wrong: the child McCarthy and Spencer's friendship was cute, and I even give the writers props for avoiding the whole ""bully turned into smart kid's friend"" trope. Then they quickly age up the characters (which, okay, I didn't sign up for a teenage story anyway) and they become estranged (fine, I've fought over much stupider stuff with my friends), all with very little humour, and none of it stupid. Was the film targeted wrong? Is this a semi serious superhero movie, and not a comedy with a superhero veneer?When McCarthy herself finally shows up, the film initially keeps the half serious tone, and paints a fairly depressing picture of a world where supervillains (albeit petty ones) exist without superheroes to fight them. They kept showing small acts of kindness on McCarthy's part, which all supported the idea she would make a great hero (a-la Steve Rogers being a hero even without his powers). I even appreciated McCarthy's nonsensical dialogue with Kevin Dunn's character, taking for granted that it wasn't supposed to be ""ha ha"" funny, and sounded like rambling in universe as well.Maybe I shouldn't have. Maybe that was supposed to be a laugh out loud bit, that simple did not land. Because from the reunion onwards, the film decides it clearly does not care about the tone it was setting, and becomes just another terrible script that some drunk Netflix executive green lit, banking solely on McCarthy's comedic fame. It just took some time to pretend it wasn't.What follows is just another superhero spoof, with a little heart here and there (I'll admit McCarthy was sweet as Taylor Mosby's sort of aunt), but otherwise nothing to say. It feels more like a collection of unrelated SNL skits, held together by spit and the pure comedic power of raw chicken eating. The villains are goofy, and not in a good way, the plot is as predictable as they come, the ""twists"" are as predictable as the plot, and overall it looks like Ben Falcone wrote half a script and then didn't bother to re-read it.Which is a shame, because the first ten minutes felt like this could be a solid superhero spoof, if maybe not a serious superhero movie. In the end, I got what I initially expected, but I still managed to be disappointed.","4","ludocalvetti"," A Disappointment

I was uncomfortable the entire time-- there were a couple of instances where the jokes landed so well and I thought ""Oh, this is a good sign"" but then the next scene the same joke was played out in a different way but worse because we just saw the joke played out five minutes prior. This happened so many times-- too many. McCarthy... you starred in ""The Heat"" and ""Spy""... you're better than this. Nothing but fart and fat jokes-- shamelessly and tastelessly executed. There was no chemistry between Spencer and McCarthy either. Spencer and Bateman, you're also better than this, but insultingly. I don't know what possessed them to take a role in this farce. I was uncomfortable at first and then I became numb and then I ended up laughing at how horribly fast everything plummeted. Waste of time and resources. This plot had so much potential and it was wasted. Four stars is a high rating, in my opinion.

Even as a buddy super hero story, the concept is new and should've been a lot of fun. Instead the jokes are flat, the story is too forced to feel like you care about the characters, and ultimately just not entertaining.A few moments scattered in the film do come together, but they're few and far between.

"3774","Ben Falcone is a great and funny guy. However, his scripts and direction lack critical editing. I'm not even half way through this painful movie and I already know how it plays out. And being formulaic isn't the worst part. It's slow. None of the scenes or dialog is tight. The scenes lack rhyme or reason, never mind being nuanced or clever. The lame jokes beat you over the head.Melissa and Octavia's character development takes way to long for what it provides and you end up not even wanting to like either one once they grow up.I'm sorry, but if Melissa's contract says Ben gets to write and direct x number of films, the studio needs to demand ghost directors and writers.Like other efforts with Ben, this comes off as half baked and unpolished. This wasn't developed enough to start shooting. There should have been 20 table reads to tune everything up. If there were actual readings, no one dared make improvements. Dialog is stiff and there isn't any of the well-timed banter that these actors are known for.So many little things aggravated me, because they were just plain lazy.Example:
Bateman's character should ALWAYS walk sideways, not just a couple times.This movie was a disservice to the actors and Falcone. Even Bobby Cannavale doesn't have enough good dialogue to save the scenes he's in.They all have much more talent than was put on film. You could trim 35 minutes and not miss a thing. I'm really surprised it got released in this form.This is Ghost Dad levels of power and irresponsiblity.Watched til the end....and regret it. It got worse. It's obvious, no one at the studio stepped in - at any point - to fix this.They just wanted to get the obligation off the books.

"3817","Why would actors do this to an audience or themselves?McCarthy has made some passable comedies, but they have become far too formulaic. She is always the goofy fat lady paired with a infinitely more confident straight-man. The plot all revolve around her magically triumphing because her plucky attitude magically overcomes her physical limitations and gross incompetence. While that trope can be funny once or twice, after a while the only thing it generates is cringe, not laughter.What I cannot fathom is why so many talented actors and actresses would debase themselves by participating in a film as bad as Thunder Force. Neither money, nor friendship with the movie's makers, should be adequate enticement to involve yourself with such a shockingly bad production.The premise of this film is, for lack of a better word, dumb. The execution of the thoroughly unoriginal concept is also subpar. Basically, Thunder Force is a study in how to waste millions of dollars and alienate fans. There is nothing good about this movie, not the dialog, not the special effects, not acting, not the story, not even the overarching morality, which encompasses pitting the most generic good guys versus bad guys.If McCarthy wants to continue with her career, she needs to evolve in some way. She cannot keep roping her friends in Hollywood into making the same movie over and over again, changing only the names as she movies from boring comedy to even more boring ""comedy"". Whatever fans she has left after this assault on audiences' intelligence are unlikely to be able to suffer through anymore of her recycled brand.","1","lusciousmuffins"," Why would they do this?

"3821","With the Coronavirus pandemic shutting Cinemas worldwide it seems like Netflix have become a force in terms of gaining the rights to films with big stars in it and Thunder Force is no different and I watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees two former friends both get superpowers and attempt to save Chicago from other superpowered beings.Main Character
Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer play the two leads here and its weird, I think both of them are pretty bad in this film but there is no denying they seems to be having fun together and it actually added a bit of energy and life to this pretty generic film. But on their own it doesn't work, Spencer isn't an actress that does comedy much and it clearly shows as she is quite stiff and rigid in her performance which is clearer due to the over the top performance by McCarthy. Now I know Melissa McCarthy can be funny, I have seen her do good work such as Spy and Can you ever forgive me? She just isn't funny here and she needs the right director and project to get that out of her and this film was not it.Supporting Characters
Jason Bateman. That is it the best part of this film is Bateman, he plays a half man half crab and he is actually pretty funny. He just adds some quirkiness and ridiculousness of the right kind that really fits and it is just a shame that the others in the film just can't get the same quality out if them. There are some other decent actors such as Bobby Cannavale, Melissa Leo and Pom Klementieff but they are such dull characters and for me it is just a real waste of the talent that the film has and sometimes I wonder why bother casting these big name performers if you aren't going to give them interesting and funny material to work with.Story
The story is absurd, but it doesn't embrace it enough. I want to see more superpowered beings for Thunder Force to go up against and it feels like the film either didn't have the budget or weren't creative enough to do that. The film tries to make you care about the characters but I really couldn't as apart from Bateman I just didn't care about the characters or their whole story because the film does nothing to make me care. This film also has something that happens in the last act that really annoyed me because it didn't feel earned and even though this is a comedy I feel like things should at least feel like they fit in the film we are watching.Script
The one job of a comedy, make me laugh and this film really failed at that. I maybe smirked a few times but I never laughed as they is no clever comedy here, it is just the most basic of basic attempts to make you laugh and you can easily see right through it. Also the drama doesn't work, it has all been done before and this film isn't good enough for it to get me invested.Style
When the action is happening there is no doubt that it can be fun to watch and fitting for a spoof of Superhero films. But I checked and the first time Thunder Force go on a mission is 45 mins into the film, that is unacceptable and by that point I had already clocked out of what the film was trying to achieve.Overall
Overall, Thunder Force is a bad comedy. McCarthy is in another comedy stinker and I just think this film lacks any of the qualities that a good comedy needs and unless you love the two leads this is one to avoid.","3","alindsay-al"," A Bad Unfunny Comedy

"3823","Who greenlit this? And why would Netflix pay a cent to license it?Fine, a slapstick comedy does not have to be consistent. It has to be funny though. This one isn't. It makes Ghostbusters 2016 look like a masterpiece.McCarthy is a great actress and Spy is one of the best comedies ever made, but there is nothing she can do with this one.Cardboard, stereotypical characters. Plot that makes little sense. I can't say there are ""plot holes"" because a ""hole"" means there are parts that actually work. Not here.The stuff you see in the trailer are the highlights. There is a couple of chuckles and McCarthy doing her schtick does relieve the awkward feeling a bit, but the rest is a chore.Hard pass.","2","vadim-berman"," No superhero can save this

"3824","I have absolutely NOTHING against McCarthy at all.But this movie is the worst I have seen in a very very very long time.There is NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING funny in it. Not one single punch line, not one joke, situation, dynamic or anything which you might otherwise enjoy in comedies.Like I said in the title, I have really no idea why they made this movie. It's absolutely unnecessary. There is no reason to watch it. It gives you NOTHING at all.Well, only reason to watch it is if you are alone in a desert island and this is the only movie you can watch.I would be very sorry for you in that case.Being alone in a desert island with only this movie to watch, that's hard.","3","ugo-64930"," Why does this movie even exist?

"
"3837","There are two opposing forces at work as I watch this one. One being my love for superhero movies battling against my general dislike for just about everything McCarthy does with poor Octavia Spencer just trapped in the middle. There were moments of this that I really wanted to enjoy, certain bits of cheese that I got a kick out of but overall this was such a nothing experience. I watched this a few days ago and while I can remember a chuckle or two and some mildly enjoyable superhero shenanigans, the rest of the movie is a complete blur of forgettable nothing.There's really nothing to recommend here unless you're just a huge McCarthy fan. If you're a fan of her whole thing, this might be a lot of fun for you but other than that I really can't see a whole lot to enjoy or take from this. It just kind of is.","4","questl-18592"," Thunder Farce
"
"3838","Oh, Melissa McCarthy you should have stayed on Mike and Molly. Octavia Spencer you should have read the script. After reading the script you should have thrown it away.Thunder Force, while it could have been funny about two forty something women gaining superpowers, instead turned out to be a lame un-funny Melissa McCarthy vehicle where she is her loud, obnoxious, stupid character that she has played many times before.Octavia Spencer, try as she might to hold this movie together to give it some heart, is clearly out of element here. You never see any emotion in her face. Is she upset that McCarthy's character comes back into her life. Is she happy? You can't tell. When she had scenes with daughter, you just don't care.The writing of this movie was so poor you could tell where it was going from the first five minutes. Under a different director and without McCarthy chewing up each scene she is in
the premise might have worked.But when McCarthy and hubby, Ben Falcone get together to make a film, funny is not what happens. Don't get me wrong Melissa can be very funny and can show real acting prowess if given a decent script and a director who reigns her in. Falcone, on the other hand, lets his wife run wild with her facial expressions and low brow attempts to be funny.Suprisingly the funniest lines come from Jason Bateman. If you dare to watch this movie, you will see that he has his timing down and is the one bright spot but that is not saying much.And don't get me started on the romantic fantasy scene in the liquor store. It was just weird and out of place.I am giving this movie one star because of the cool looking superhero costumes. Of course, you can see the costumes in the trailer so take my word for it - give this movie a hard pass and do something else with your time.","1","don-13204"," This Movie Should Have Stayed Invisible

I stopped at the awkyard ""Jodie Foster"" scene and realised it can only get worse from here.While the actors gained my respect due their performances in other features, they had an all time low here. I guess they felt a little too cosy in this McCarthy/Falcone environment and didn't second-guess the possible outcome of bad jokes in combination with literally explaining gags and therefor ruining a whole shot.It was dull acting and a watered down introduction of the first act that turned me off.","1","Chris_Ego"," external shame, cringeworthy jokes

Tv-shows, movies, there is never enough lay down in the intro scenes. Its very noticeable in for example; The letter for the king, Shadowhunters. Cursed etc. Its just too shallow.The only exceptions I have seen myself are, Santa clarity diet, Better call Saul, The OA, Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and maybe a few more.

Sympathy jobs. Then I looked at the list of bad films he has put out in the past. Yup. Chalk another one up. I will be sure to check the director next time before I watch a McCarthy film.Octavia Spenser looked awkward and out of place, like she couldn't understand how she got in this film and she just wanted to flee. I kept thinking 'what is wrong here? I have never seen an off performance by her before.' Now I know.I usually complain about too many cutty-choppy fast paced scenes in movies these days but this one went in the opposite direction; every scene seemed bloated and empty. You can see McCarthy trying to carry the weight of this piece of trash on her shoulders while the director slashes and burns every bit of comic timing she puts out.Just bad timing, bad writing, bad film.","2","Opinate"," McCarthy needs to get a filmic divorce from her husband.

"3861","Just realized that one of my biggest nightmares was watching Melissa McCarthy do the Fortnite dance.OH MAN Melissa and her husband are back with another cringy attempt at comedy on Netflix. Damn it Melissa, why does it have to be so cringe?A dumb and generic superhero movies where two women gained abilities and save the world. Woo! Love it!I was pretty much bored from start to finish. The jokes were so horrendous and lame, even though some got me chuckled a little bit. Pretty much everything in the movie was a cliche: the plot, story, characters, villains, dialogues, even the freaking TITLE. And oh boi they tried to connect to us youngsters by having Melissa McCarthy play Fortnite, a pretty-much-dying game. What a way to attract audiences.This is like a bunch of Karens trying to be edgy and relatable to the kiddos. Gosh it's painful.As much as I hate McCarthy's comedy, I don't get why other great actors like Octavia Spencer and Jason Bateman signed up for this lame stuff.At the end, I had some tears, because I was sleepy trying to finish this boring ""comedy"" and I was glad it's over.Please McCarthy and Falcone just stop making these trash and waste of time movies.I wanted to rant even though I'm sleepy as heck.

Apparently we cannot even have that anymore, her movies are getting so bad they are not even c-level.You want to waste your money, create a urine soaked dumpster of a movie while people are laughing behind your back? Hire Melissa McCarthy.I know she can be funny, I actually enjoyed Spy, but something has just gone wrong along the way and I am uncertain if its her own bad taste in scripts or Hollywood just trying to force us this overweight feminist whether she is in good or bad movies.Well, one of the leads aside, she is not the only thing that stinks around this movie. Octavia is almost as bad, and all the side characters and the supposed protagonist are so bad it is not even funny.But of course, as with most bad movies, it does not stop with bad acting or bad writing or bad casting choices, nope, it all suck. Light, CGi, music, clothes, story, every single bit and piece of this movie is so horrible I kept shaking my head and wondering if I have ever seen anything worse.I have by the way, seen worse that is.

"3885","MAYBE this movie suddenly became great in the last half hour. Maybe the effects suddenly became better than what a typical 12-year-old could produce with a laptop, and the writing suddenly rose from the bottom of the barrel and became profound and intelligent. It could even be that Melissa McCarthy's performance improved to the semi-professional level she showed in ""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" or even to the lesser level of ""Bridesmaids,"" and Octavia Spencer finally lost the well-deserved look of embarrassment she carried for the first hour or so.I'll never know. Heaven knows I tried to keep a brave face and hope for some improvement (and I bet I watched more of this movie than most people have, including the cast of it) but after an hour I just couldn't subject myself to any more. The only reason I watched as long as I did -- the ONLY REASON-- is that it was my turn to pick the movie, and I couldn't stand to see the smug look my wife would have when I threw in the towel. As it turns out, she was so grateful she never said a word, beyond ""Oh thank God"" when I said we had to find something else.Looks like I owe her another viewing of ""Mama Mia."" I can take it. I can take anything. I watched an hour of Thunder Force.""","3","NavyOrion"," I tried, I really did

"3894","The writers couldn't let go of their ridiculous leftist bias to realize they got the details almost right, just on the wrong teams. The background story is that the mayor of Chicago is running for re-election (he's the ""Trump"" character) and the ""progressive"" Hispanic woman is moving up in the polls. So this guy gets all the mutants to cause chaos so he has a problem to fix. Think of the mutants (miscreants) as BLM and antifa. Only problem is that they got it all backwards. But that is the MO of the left - accuse your opponent of doing what you're actually doing. If they made the crazy mayor the ""amazing progressive"" and the underdog opponent the grassroots conservative who actually cares about making the city better instead of filling diversity quotas, destroying the economy, and stoking division, then the story would have been true to reality. They certainly took their artistic liberties here.The funniest part of the whole thing is that they accidentally showed that if you work hard, you can achieve anything no matter where you came from or what you look like. Whoops, that was an unfortunate oversight. Guess the poor, silly, slobby one just forgot to utilize her ""privilege"" and Spencer just had some magical ability to overcome the ""institutional"" obstacles standing in her way. What a miracle.They should probably work harder to push their agendas next time instead of focusing on things like story, character development, and dialogue.There were some funny moments. Enjoyed the bit where McCarthy was trying to get Spencer to recognize Urkel and Nell.","3","karamarika"," Could have been good, but

"3900","Why, oh why, am I giving this film 3 stars? Is it because Octavia Spencer can't and shouldn't be as bad as she is here? In some scenes I have the impression that she herself is surprised at the nonsense she has to say and do. And Melissa McCarthy? Well, there's not much new to report. Over 50 % of the jokes don't land, the other 50 % consist almost exclusively of unpleasant remarks about bodily fluids or the sounds thereof.

"3906","This probably looked good on paper, but between page and screen it fell into a quality vacuum. Given the talent in the cast it serves as proof that if they're working with rubbish, there's not a lot their talent can do to salvage it. The script is weak, the plotline is thin and McCarthy needs reining in or she needs some new tricks. That Octavia Spencer and Jason Bateman got suckered into this defies understanding. Having just watched Bateman in ""This is where I leave you"", this was embarrassing. If you want a sideways take on superheroes just go back to Hancock or Deadpool - something with a bit of intelligence in it.Just throwing a load of CGI at something doesn't make a good film.It's for hard-core McCarthy fans only.","3","terminalsofa"," A waste of talent

"3911","I loved the idea. The whole concept was fun. Two friends. Opposites. Who, no matter what, care for each other, and in a way complete something inside each other. I know Melissa's humor often goes over the top but I think in this film it was well balanced. And Octavia is typically a serious actress, I thought she did well to bring the film a slightly milder tone. It was full of geek Easter Eggs, one of which was a You Killed Kenny line that made my sides hurt.If you didn't get the humor or the story it was simply not meant for you. I enjoyed this film immensely. If this movie had been done with younger thinner actresses I believe the rating would have been higher. But I am so glad that it was done with these two beautiful and real looking ladies.I know they may not make another but I wish they would.

How could Ben Falcone cast an Oscar winner in a poorly made film? Everything from pre-production to post-production was rushed, which is unacceptable in Hollywood.

There is a shoehorned-in romance that is more cringe-making than anything, and the bad guy is a total joke. The characters are paper thin, and acting almost non-existent.

It's as if she signed up to the film, before reading the script ('cause it had Melissa in it of course, why wouldn't you!?) and later regretted the decision, but it was too late to say no.This could have been so much better, the acting, jokes, direction and so on. The only person (character) who I felt close to genuine was the actress playing the daughter of Octavia's character.

"3974","I gave it a five only for the beginning of the movie. I love both Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer. In fact I am shocked Octavia did such a horrible movie. As a person who is not a size zero. I am getting a little upset on how Melissa McCarthy portrays women of size. It's embarrassing. She mostly portrays as uncouth and gross sense of humor. While I don't usually care about swearing she just does it in times it's not called for. Even if you weren't raised in the best situation her character was around others with manners (for the love of god) pickup so social cures. I did like how the story started out with the girls young. I had hope. Then it just went to gross humor and predictable screw ups. I just wanted this to be good. I was disappointed..","5","michelec-93774"," No need to watch this

I watched it with my parents who are in their sixties and we all laughed through the whole film, did we think some of it was stupid? Hell yes! But my god was it a fun movie to escape from this horrible world even for just 106 minutes.We really like this movie and we will be watching it again, so if you want a fun escape like we did then why not give it a shot?","10","grimm-21014"," Wasn't the best, but it was very entertaining!

"3979","It's not Endgame or Justice League, but this is a totally enjoyable movie with a few good laughs throughout.

Yes, yes it is. The only reason I wrote this review was because I felt I needed to come to this movies defence in the wake of a slew of negative reviews trashing the Falcone McCarthy team. I hope they keep making movies together and I hope they make me laugh like this one did.The only critical comment I have is that this would have made a better TV show than a movie, but it's still worth a watch.

But to see her in this type of film its pretty heart breaking as some people would know she can do a lot more better.I know there is a load more extra characters in this movie, i ain't going to slate them all but i will say this film is definitely a NOT THE ONE TO WATCH!!!!

"3998","Thunder force
2021
12A
Director: Ben Falcone
Starring: Melissa McCarthy, Octavia Spencer, Jason Bateman, Pom Klementieff, Bobby Canavale, Melissa Leo, Tayler Mosby etcOverall rating 31/100Thunder force is about a world where supervillains are commonplace, two estranged childhood best friends reunite after one devises a treatment that gives them powers to protect the city. Wow what can I say Thunder force was absolutely terrible and Melissa McCarthy's worst film that she has been in, she really needs to stop working with her husband as she is so talented but is being type casted as the same character each film she is in, let's get started.I will be nice and start with a few positives the movie had a good set up, some good setting up of the story world and the main characters friendship and some good character background. I thought that the movie actually started out pretty decent, it set up the main plot point for the movie well, establishing the story world, the characters and the rise of the miscreants that had me interested. I also thought that they did a good job with giving both main characters good character background and set up their friendship well, the movie spent a good amount of time developing the younger versions of themselves establishing a good connection between them and setting up their reunion when they were older pretty well.Now lets get into some negatives the movie had generic conflict, poorly written break up of friendships, a terrible script and really bad pacing issues. The movies sources of conflict between the two main characters was so generic and lazily written it was really poor, they broke of their friendship for the most pathetic and boring reason and it was just very amateurish writing, there was never really enough conflict for the characters or between the characters that was truly notable. I also thought the script was absolutely terrible, it was poorly and lazily written, with every cliché of the genre imaginable, the dialogue was awkward and clunky and never landed and it was just often very cringy and awkward to watch. I also thought the movie had awful pacing issues, everything felt extremely rushed and it never gave you any time to digest any of the scenes, this made the movie lose its emotion and impact and often was just inconsistent with its entertainment levels.My next few negatives would be the lack of humour the film had, the lazy set up, how predictable it was and the lack of chemistry between the leads. The movie just simply wasn't funny, it was awkward and clunky and the jokes very rarely landed which was such a shame because the cast is funny with good writing, but even their charm and charisma wasn't enough for the movie, the movie simply tried to hard to be funny and it simply achieved the opposite. The movie had simply lazy set up, the whole set up of the powers being introduced with the main characters it was lazily written and predictable and made the characters seem extremely dumb. The movie was also very predictable, it followed every single cliché of the genre possible, I could predict all the plot twists of the movie half an hour before it even happened and did nothing to go against that, it felt like a copy and paste of so many other movies. I also thought that their was a lack of chemistry between the two characters, I love Melissa McCarthy and I love Octavia Spencer but for me they didn't work well together, their comedy is fairly different and both characters were fairly mean and toxic to each other for a lot of the movie and weren't really that likeable.My final few positives would be the good cinematography, some fun sequences of powers, some funny moments and a few fun action sequences. The movie did have fairly decent cinematography in places not in all of the action scenes but sometimes the characters powers actually looked pretty good and they paid attention to detail in parts which was nice to see. I also thought there was some fun sequences highlighting the main characters powers, the montage of Melissa McCarthy training her powers was funny, interesting and one of the few times were the humour actually worked, they also spent a decent amount of time on it as well which I liked. I also thought some of the action sequences were fairly fun, although unrealistic in places they were still for the most part entertaining and some of the best parts of the movie.My next few negatives would be the repetitive plot points, the awkward and corny tone as well as the lack of depth to the main characters and the villains. The movie had some very repetitive plot points, it repeated dialogue that was supposed to be funny multiple times when it just wasn't and then just had recycled and reused plot points sprinkled over the movie making the pacing very clunky, this lead onto my next criticism in that it had a very awkward and corny tone. The movie was simply too awkward, they tried way too hard to be funny and it simply wasn't making it incredibly awkward to watch and just had so many corny lines of dialogue that felt recycled from a cringy 80's movie. I also thought the movie lacked any form of character depth, the characters were on dimensional and cliched and didn't really have any form of development or overall depth, the villains were also terrible, not once did they feel like a threat, they were poorly written given corny dialogue and it was just so cliched and boring it was often painful to watch.My final few negatives would be odd character decisions, lapses in the logic and lack of heartwarming moments of themes. I found that the movie had really odd character decisions, the film was riddled with inconsistencies with its characters, they were often making decisions that simply just didn't make sense or felt forced to move onto the next plot point, it was just filled with lapses in logic that just made the movie come across as ridiculous and lazy. I also thought the movie just lacked any form of heartwarming moments and themes. Any kind of sweet moments were either rushed or just felt too forced and generic, for a good comedy to work usually they have an empowering theme or some good emotion to it that makes you connect with it on a different level and Thunder force was unfortunately missing this quality for me.Overall, Thunder force had some funny and entertaining moments with a somewhat interesting idea that just didn't land. In what was an awkward, predictable, not funny, lazily written mess. And is a complete embarrassing waste of the talented actors involved. Melissa McCarthy needs to stop working with her husband.","3","rnixon-15663"," Thunder Force

"4001","Going into this movie, I was prepared to love it, for a few reasons. I love Octavia Spencer and Melissa McCarthy; I think they are both incredibly talented women, for that alone, I went in with high expectations and the other reason is that the movie has two plus-size leads and as a plus person myself, I am all for that representation, especially in a superhero movie as this is almost always never the norm. The twisted thing about expectations however is that they usually lead to disappointment and this movie had bucket loads of it.When Melissa McCarthy is a lead in a movie, it would be naÃ¯ve of one not to expect comedy and that is exactly what happened in this movie, her character has little to no character development, her whole arc in the movie is entirely mad up of being the comic relief like any other movie she is in. This is not Melissa's fault because for the most part, it works, I found myself giggling a few times during the movie, I think I was meant to laugh a lot more but most of the jokes fell flat, Melissa and Octavia are both plus-size women, so the better part of the movie is dedicated to fat stereotypical jokes, that compensate for a lackluster storyline.Melissa McCarthy with the help of the young girls that played a younger her(Vivian Falcone and Mia Kaplan) did a decent job bringing a typical Melissa McCarthy character, Lydia, to life. The really isn't much to dissect about her character, she plays out how you'd expect her to play out from the moment she is introduced. Melissa McCarthy might just be the most typecast actress in Hollywood, but that is a discussion for another time.The storyline was promising, a young, smart black girl, who had a bad thing happen to her as a child, growing up to be a powerful woman dedicated to fighting back against those that wronged her as a child is an inspiring story and Octavia Spencer and the young actresses that played a younger her(Bria Danielle and Tai Leshaun) did an amazing job breathing life into the character of Emily Stanton but somehow the storyline still fell flat, and this was mostly due to the fact that the movie is too self-aware, it is very aware of the diverse cast it has, the inclusivity feeling the viewer will get while watching, unfortunately it is also because of that self-awareness that they didn't take time to develop their characters, make you care about the heroes, even the villain.The Crab had more character development than both our heroes, and his whole deal is that he has crabs for arms, when the only character that is memorable from your movie is a guy whose power is having crab arms, then you know your movie did something wrong. This movie had moments where it felt like they wanted you to take a moment serious but then ruined it with a lazy dry joke in the next scene. This movie is bad as far as superhero movies go but it's a decent watch if your thing is laughing over forced stereotypical jokes.","2","khanirawlingsk"," Superhero movie, but make it about fat jokes.
"
"4002","An amusing idea and a great cast can't compensate for poor writing, tedious pacing, a plodding and predictable plot, sloppy editing, and a tragic uncertainty about direction or tone. This film could've been the next Sky High, The Mask, Super, Mystery Men, or even Deadpool. Unfortunately, thanks to what feels like a rush-job with some actor-director nepotism thrown in, it's not even Shazam. I'll give it a 6 for originality and potential and a 4 for execution. That's about a 5. And I'll take away a point for wasting the talents of Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer. (And for wasting Pom Klementieff who should spend the rest of her life playing Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy where she positively scintillates!) So 4 / 4.5 out of 10 feels about right.

"
"4007","McCarthy has funny films that have a typical formula that make them funny, usually starting with a script written by people who get the comedy genre and then a director paired with an editor that understand timing and delivery. This film doesn't have that formula. The reviews that say 10/10 should be required to answer a real ""why"" question in order to be visible by others.My ""why"" for a 2/10: falls flat on many scenes that could have been funny if the right lead was cast. McCarthy as a dumb but strong character paired with a woman that seems to lack any and all comic ability definitely delivers as is. That is- it doesn't. Spencer is a great actress. We have seen her delivery in dramas. It makes no sense in this case when really all we needed as a humorous lead allowing McCarthy to be the comic relief she's good at as a supporting character or one that can be trashed and get laughs.A quick search for ""Spy"" is a good resume for McCarthy's success. Or even brides maids. Both roles she acted as a side kick to someone even more ridiculous than here. Spencer doesn't do it.","2","michael-561-692892"," Not worth the time commitment

"4027","I'm not sure exactly when they began filming this movie, but it's quite evident that this was made during the Covid era, which at least explains some of its downfall. During the first third of the movie, characters are seen standing 10 feet apart from each other for entire scenes, including a reunion moment when the main characters are supposed to be seeing each other for the first time in 20 years. Lack of physical interaction / touching is also pretty noticable. I can commend the cast and crew for trying to get work done in the midst of a pandemic, but unfortunately the script itself is ultra lacking.The characters are one dimensional, and two of the main villains have a severe lack of motive and seem to both just have an inexplicable fetish for ""killing people."" What an innovative concept for a baddie. Meanwhile, Michelle McCarthy is using super strength to fight off bad guys while Octavia Spencer turns invisible and hides...she does almost nothing the entire movie. Neither does Jason Bateman, whom I love, but whose super power is...crab arms? And he participates in fights by literally...clipping his claws and sideways crab-walking away? And he somehow used this talent to make it into the elite inner circle of the bad guys?Aside from a few laughable moments, most of the script and comedy was gimmicky and predictable. I felt like I was reading the first draft of a script (which again, maybe was because it was all they could do to get content made during COVID, but unfortunately...it's a bit of a fail.)

"4045","""I'll do everything in my power to keep you safe. I'm doing this for my parents, for my city.""Believe it or not, Ben Falcone may have made his worst movie yet. In a world where supervillains are commonplace, two estranged childhood best friends reunite after one devises a treatment that gives them powers to protect their city. Thunder Force has Octavia Spencer and (who would've thought) Melissa McCarthy leading this comedic take on superheroes. We all know that his movies aren't meant to be taken too seriously with how silly they are. Nothing about this movie is funny. I didn't laugh once even with the comedic genius that is McCarthy. The movie is so boring. We thought Superintelligence was awful but this is even more intolerable. First off, it's so prolonged to the point where it runs out of ideas. It's so predictable that it gets annoying. I will reiterate that this is not funny at all. There are so many forced moments to make a joke but they're too forced to even get a smirk out. I feel so bad for Octavia Spencer because she is genuinely a great actress and has a fairly good track record. Melissa McCarthy has fallen off the radar shortly after her Oscar nominated performance for Can You Ever Forgive Me? And it's not surprising. She's also finding horrible projects to be attached to, mainly being her husband (Ben Falcone), and gets an even worse reputation. Maybe someday she'll find a glimmer of hope again. I don't like ripping on movies so I'll end it here. A select few might like this.

There are movies that you think they would be funny and then they're not (Identity Thief), there are movies that you don't think they'd be funny and then they are (Spy, The Heat, Ghostbusters). And then there are the movies that you don't think they'd be funny, but because you've been there and eventually found them funny, you end up watching it, and then you find it is not funny at all. Thunder Force belongs to the latter one.Spencer and McCarthy don't have chemistry as soromance/BFF, the acting direction does not exist in this movie, the story is kind of lame and weak, powerless. The directing is as standard as any mid-budget fantastic flick, with the same shots, the same camera movements, the same editing, the same CGIs, the same whatever.I honestly thought that most of the people would be wrong about the negative reviews, but after watching Thunder Force, all I can say is that don't waste a couple of hours of your time by watching this flawed comedy.","4","strindbergman"," Barely funny

"4054","What a beautiful song to conclude this sweet series adapted from the YA novels by Jenny Han ""To All The Boys I've Loved Before"". While not as strong as the first movie, this third and final film in the trilogy was better than the second film. There were some great Seoul travel shots and some wonderful shots of New York City...but ultimately this was the final entry in Peter and Lara Jean's romantic love story that started with a bunch of love letters and a fake relationship...and is concluded in this film which starts with The Covey (Lara Jean's) Family in Seoul, Korea for spring break. The big highlights in the film are the senior trip to New York, finding out about college acceptance, the prom, Dr. Covey's wedding, and graduation. This film is like a post card for high school romance and doesn't delve too deep into any heavy topics, although they do make an attempt to heal Peter's relationship with his father and touch on the Covey family grief in regards to their mom.Sweet, good hearted escapism and perfect Valentine's tribute!","6","cgvsluis"," Will you be my...beginning, my middle, my end?

"4055","I'm annoyed that it was the EXACT same plot as the last two-super cute in the beginning, a break up in the middle, and then a super cute make up at the end. Just substitute NYU for John Ambrose and you got the same movie.I gave it a 6 because, like the other two, the cinematography, costume design, music, and actors were so damn likeable! Although, I would expect a Hollywood hair stylist to figure out extensions by now-the hair was driving me crazy.Overall, I REALLY wanted to like this, but it just felt like I was rewatching the same movie over and over.","6","Anne-0016"," Copy/Paste Plot
"
"4056","It didn't have the charm of the first, and even felt very different than the second. The idea of Peter dragging Lara Jean about NYU and making her feel guilty is very out of character, a change from the book that makes a series about love and hope feel very.... Toxic. I think small changes are fine, but that one make this movie much more painful than necessary, and not a great message. Missed opportunity! Make Peter more vulnerable! Make Lara Jean work on expectations! So much room for positive character growth!","6","ktweitzman"," Felt different than the first two

"4057","After the disappointment of the second movie ""p.s I still love you"" I definitely had low expectations going into the final instalment of the series, yet I was gladly surprised by how much I enjoyed the film . Although not being anything particularly redefining in the romance genre, with a notably substandard plot , I couldn't help but be charmed by the atmosphere of the movie and the chemistry between Lana Condor and Noah Centineo, the latter generally surprising me since I had preferred the relationship between Lara Jean and her other love interest John Ambrose in the previous movie far more than hers and Peter's. So, even though the movie was nothing remarkable, it still remained a feel good movie for anyone to enjoy, and ended the series on a high note.","5","grgiadsmith"," A pleasant ending to a charming series

"4058","So... it had soooo many things to point out.1. It didn't follow much of the book.
2. They took out ALOT of scenes that could have helped the plot such as the beach scene.
3. Why make Kavinsky so insecure for no outcome? Or for them to just make up like typical children that are supposed to be developing into adults?
4. Why not add an additional scene such as visiting Berkeley? Especially if you are going to change up the the plot of the series?
5. What was the point to the Dae and Kitty romance?
6. Tri's actor made no sense to the character and was severely underwhelming.
7. If you can't make hair extensions work, then get a damn wig. Her hair was terrible for the entire movie.
8. Why wouldn't Josh have been invited to the wedding? Or any characters that had a build?
9. She looked boring at prom in comparison to a old seniors home dance from the second.
10. No where near as good as the first, and worse than the second which was only ""okay""Basically this movie was... lacking. It got a 3 because of its continuation of series and typical high school romcom which is my guilty pleasure at the age of 32. Otherwise, i likely won't be in a hurry to rewatch this.","3","Pinebutt"," Meh

"4059","The first film in the franchise wasn't anything groundbreaking, but still felt fresh. The second installment was, in my opinion, a major downgrade, particularly in terms of character development. Now we have come to the conclusion of the trilogy, and a movie that feels just like a hundred teen romance dramas that have come before it.The main criticism is that this movie doesn't implement anything that hasn't been done before. Really, from the second the plot of the movie becomes apparent, anyone who has ever seen a movie will be able to guess what happens. It's a simple story of 'girl loves boy, but girl receives a huge opportunity that forces her to choose between her own life and her relationship'. Some standard awkward situations follow, that could as always be so easily avoided if the characters possessed even a lick of common sense. The couple breaks up, realizes they do still love each other, and eventually decide to try and work things out. Doesn't that sound familiar?The saving grace of the movie are still its characters however. Lara Jean is a charming, kind and positive spirit, while Peter distinguishes himself as a supportive and caring boyfriend. The Covey family dynamic, and their Korean roots, are fleshed out even further, and deservedly so. It's the little interactions between the characters that give the movie most of its charm.The actors do a fine job, and the cinematography and camerawork deserve some applause as well. The humor in the film is fine, but also feels derivative of other teen comedies.All in all, this movie is by no means the worst of its kind. It has its moments and several positive aspects, but it falls flat in simply providing nothing that original or new to the genre or movies in particular.","6","roel-willemsen"," Very formulaic, but still charming

"4073","This is the final movie in to all the boys trilogy. Lara Jean and Peter are in their senior year, planning for college while navigating their relationship.What I liked-
1. Talks about real teenage relationship issues.
2. Effects of absent parental relationships.
3. Consent.
4. Candy-Pastel Colour pallet.What I didn't like
1. It's a bit slowThe best part about TATB apart from great acting and song selections is its dedication to talk about teenage issues in relationships. It's a character study of 2 teenagers LJ and Peter who fear that they'll never find true love because their parents either unintentionally, in case of LJ or intentionally, in case of Peter, left them when they were young. That lack of love disrupts their belief and expression of love.In this movie we see lots of relationships- LJ's dad finding love after years of loneliness, The sister bond among the song girls is at its tender peak, Kitty has a Korean boyfriend, Peter reconciles with his father, and last but not the least LJ and Peter took the courage to love each other despite the odds that they face- 3000 miles apart.In 1st and the 2nd movie (the drowned one in my opinion) we saw LJ dealing with her fears- stable love, insecurity because of comparison, people from the past, etc and Peter with his lack of open communication. In the 3rd-
1. LJ comes out of her hesitancy and fully takes agency over her life- accepts stable love, visits Korea, explores NYC, speaks her mind etc, which were big character developments.
2. In a vulnerable moment LJ says ""I choose you""- admirable. It shows they are in for the long haul.
3. They are emotionally mature to talk about sex. (such a relief from other dumb rom-com)
4. Peter finally overcomes his fear that ""no one chooses him"", accepts LJ's dreams and also communicates his feelings. We see his sensitivity, a character development.They are finally ready to take care of themselves and their relationship. To all the boys is that one series which took me out of the rom-com rut.

This movie put some focus on some of the side characters as well, but instead of it being cluttered and all over the place, everything flows so nicely together!I am a sappy person, and I will cry at anything and everything that I think is beautiful, and I found myself crying about 4 or 5 times during the movie.

#2 Biracial relationships, different cultures, and diversity throughout the cast and films.
#3 Lara Jean and Peter Kavinksy...need I say more?!?!
Alright, I'll admit...I am a sucker for rom coms...but it really is awesome to see a boss lady like Lana Condor representing the asian american woman in Hollywood.

He was also an absolutely jerk for almost 90% of the movie and then suddenly everything was forgotten and forgiven. I do not like Peter Kavinsky, nether the book's nor the movie's one and maybe I am alone in this but it is where I firmly stand.This was my favorite book from the trilogy and the second best movie.

After watching this movie i was like? wait what actually happened? like was that it? LJ just decides what uni she wants and gets back together with peter, who like just broke up with her for a day, so like was it even a break up? THERE IS NO ACTION, NO COMEDY, NO ROMANCE, just CRINGE. In conclusion, the dad was the main character.
sorry for this harsh review but like... come one a 3rd grader can write a better movie.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","azzaelcool"," To all the boys i ever loved before? more like to the same boy i keep breaking up with.

"4088","Starting with the positive, I like how they use Gee at the beginning and the diversity of the cast is worth praising. Also, the color tone of the movie is very pleasing.But that's it. The rest of it is annoying. They are being so dramatic over the college thing. Two hours of Larajean hopelessly devoted to Peter and having an emotional rollercoaster at her room. And Peter acting all cool and effortlessly popular. It's honestly very have to relate to them and care for the storyline. And as everyone has said, that's no plot. It's just a bunch of montage without real happenings that push the story progression or character growth.And can we talk about how Peter SUDDENLY changed his mind and prepare this surprise and Larajean SUDDENLY felt okay about everything again? It's basically the ending of the 2nd movie too. It's too cheesy and hard to watch...","4","melodyso"," had to fast forward most of it

Unfortunately I had to stop watching it after 45 minutes because nothing interesting had happened and I was certain that nothing interesting was ever going to happen.The only good thing about this movie was the scene in the cartoon style cafe. It made me want to visit that cafe. You see the problem here? I was more interested in the filming locations than the actors and dialogue.

"4090","A complete bore and utter waste of time. whats the point of this third sequel? happily ever after exist and prince charming will come saving your from whatever misery. i did not just spend 2/3 of the movie watching lara jean decide on which uni to enrol in. the movie didnt ever go as far as to take us to life in the university where conflicts could possibly unravel. it literally stopped at a bloody university choice with a petty fight ensuing after with a 'i will always love you' closure. lazy production. a first grader could have possibly came up with this storyline. tbh i enjoyed the first sequel bc we could empathise and relate to lara jean and her embarrassment. but the other sequels are just starting to make me believe that lara jean a conceited mawkish champ who needs to be snapped out of her fantasy. and need i add: there's nothing special about lara jean to gawked at or be captivated by. this whole fairytale set up with disgustingly sugarcoated.","1","berrydrops"," fantasy in la la land

"4093","The first question I need to personally answer is: Why is a 71 year old man watching and reviewing this Neflix flick? There is a reason -- one of the supporting actors was a student in the middle school where I was (at the time) the vice principal -- and that is Ross Butler. I think he's a talented not-as-young-as-he-looks actor who isn't getting enough good parts, although he did VERY nicely in ""Thirteen Reasons Why"". I wish him great luck in his career.As to this film...well, it certainly is aimed at the teen crowd. And that's okay. I will tell you this...three ""chapters"" of this is enough. The plot here is...well, not thin, but one-minded: will the high school lovers have a life together beyond high school. At first it's yes. Then it's no. And finally it's maybe. And I have to admit that the final answer is done nicely, if what you want is a happy ending that's not necessarily very realistic.You're not going to be on the edge of your seat watching this. It's fairly predictable. But I do have to give kudos to Lana Condor, who plays the lead high school character. I think she's a good actress. I'm not as impressed with Noah Centineo, the lead male here. I've seen him in a couple of Netflix movies and...well, I just don't get the attraction. Anna Cathcart, as the younger sister has potential. Everyone else...well they look young and adequate.The first installment of this series of three movies was the best. I really can't recommend this one.","6","vincentlynch-moonoi"," If I didn't know one of the actors...

"4100","I'm probably far too old to enjoy teenage movies but I loved the first To All the Boys so had hoped for this third instalment to provide light, but a bit different, relief during lockdown. Well I was wrong.There was nothing joyful or quirky about this film. 2 hours of immature back and forth, are we really to believe teenagers still behave like this? And do we really want to sell young women this pretty, rose tinted idea of romance?Peter at no point offered to change college after year 1 to be closer to LJ, putting the onus on LJ to make their relationship work and quite frankly gave the whole story a pretty misogynistic vibes. And that's ignoring everything (aka the hottub scene) that happened in the second film. I missed John Ambrose's character given how much more mature he was and how he treated LJ as an equal.On reflection they should have stopped after the first film.","4","Sonnenblume63"," Dull and sexist

"4103","The third film in this trilogy and the finale of the trilogy, takes place after a family trip to Seoul where our main character finds herself exploring her college options and what it means to her relationship.Now obviously this film is full of cliches. You have the teenage girl thinking about where she wants to go to college and where she sees herself later on in life. I had a hard time seeing things through peters perspective in this film as he wants her to go to the same college thinking it is the only solution. The conflict in this film will hit hard for people who have been in this situation which many people have, even if you don't agree with some of the character decisions.The soundtrack in this film is really good. Sometimes in these types of films it can become a bit silly, but the soundtrack here really fits well. If you're already invested in this trilogy I recommend watching this as it is a satisfying conclusion.Overall I'm going to give ""To All The Boys: Always And Forever"" a 7/10","7","ryanwesthamfan"," A Worthy And Satisfying Conclusion Of The Trilogy

"4104","The first one was hands down the best, was not cringey and did not make me think it was cliche like most Netflix movies. Second was awful and undid everything the first did, was way too fast for any of her romances and just made her seem dumb. Now the third movie, it was better than I expected but I felt like it was sort of unresolved. He gets all upset because you want to attend a university that fits you? Sounds like a major red flag to me. Then he doesn't even want to give it a try but somehow makes it seem like he's madly in love with you and wins you back so easily? I don't know I found some parts cringe but it did a better job than the second. I think 5/10 is being pretty generous. I do like that LJ was consistent on who was her friend etc and not erasing what had been done. I also liked how they brought back the Lauv song. I wished we got some context as to what happened to Josh, her childhood best friend from the first movie... like what he was her neighbour too. I also want to know where John Ambrose is. It just feels like they brush off characters so easily. Oh whoever was in charge of the costumes did an awful job.

To me, the plot felt very ""oh god I didn't get into the college I want, but now I did, what do I do??"" yada yada yada... It felt very first world problems. The plot felt incredibly boring: first you plan for college, don't get in, be sad, get into another one, be happy, have to choose, be sad, then everyone makes up in the end to be happy. I did appreciate some of the acting during some of the more ""sad"" scenes, but all of the happy/montage/joke moments came off as super unauthentic and very predictable. I swear I could feel a vein popping out of my cranium when I had to hear another ""joke"" that was entirely predictable by some previous scene like the film is nudging at you ""Hey hey did ya catch that?

"4107","This trilogy has been a fun cute high school rom com. The third installment is the lesser of the three. The scene that stuck out the most, surprisingly is in the diner with Peter and his dad. It was simple, yet moving. This may not be appropriate in terms of reviewing a movie but I just gotta say, the movie is not a happy ending. Their not gonna make it. Coast to coast, formidable years completely separate, been dating for less than a year, and afterwards what? Is Peter gonna move to NY, play catch up with their relationship, and find a job? If it's true to the books then there you go but I don't see it. This is also fiction so I guess it doesn't matter.

"4115","It can be hard to end a trilogy. To All the Boys: Always and Forever tries it and flops.Though the film is easy to enjoy when watching, it fails once one scratches beneath the surface.Also, what's with romcoms that have relationships with red flags?LDRs are not easy, and this movie ends up setting both main characters for failure. Peter (Noah Centineo) shows that he is not ready for the commitment of an LDR. Lara Jean (Lana Condor) ends up being a passive character willing to give up everything for him. She basically goes to a school that is not her first choice to save the relationship.And getting back together was a cheesy way to wrap things up. It's predictable and leads to no character development throughout the story. No growth at all. What message does this send to its viewers?Also, ""we're not like the other couples."" No. They stage 1 of a failed LDR.

"4119","So I am a big fan of American teenage romances. They are unrealistic however they are glamorous and feel good. They show you the school life which folks like me in India only dream of. No uniform , kissing in school, high school jocks, popular mean cheerleaders and always getting admissions in Stanford , Berkeley or the ivy leagues. This one was really sweet. I thoroughly enjoyed the mixed race lead played by Lana. Her acting was perfect. Noah overacted a bit with unnecessary brow raises and head tilts but was watchable. The sisters were good and dad was the best. It's one of those series which you always want more and more sequels cause they have a feel good factor. Fortunately the relationship wasn't shown to be toxic and forceful like the After series and Kissing booth. They are enjoyable and colourful. There is great chemistry between the lead actors. I personally wish that they do more movies together. Noah however needs to up himself in the acting game.","10","tanaytamhankar"," Loved !

"4120","The only good thing about this film is the aestethic interior and clothing choice. Although sometimes it's also too much. The film is filled with untied ends.

The two protagonists are impossible to like, they're toxic and they have no chemistry. The whole cast is awful and the characters have no traits other than their love for each other and their family issues. They have awful personalities and the whole plot is just non-existing.

"4122","Lana Condor returns for the final installment of the Netflix hit film series. Condor & fam (her 2 sisters, dad, again played by John Corbett, & dad's new woman, returning champion from the last installment Sarayu Rao) are on vacation in South Korea enjoying the sights (w/the youngest sister, Anna Cathcart, meeting a young hottie) but home awaits & more importantly college acceptance (or rejection) letters. W/that Sword of Damocles hanging over Condor's head (she's hoping to get into Stanford so her & beau, Noah Centineo, can still be together) things only get complicated when she's rejected by Stanford (she then decides to go to Berkley which is an hour away & hell even Centineo suggests that after a year she can xfer to Stanford anyway) but then a school trip to New York happens where she visits the NYU campus where she falls in love all over again w/that school (which she's already been accepted to) & doesn't know how to break it to Centineo & so it goes as we hurtle towards the potentially heart wrenching but ultimately satisfying end w/all the leads charm & good will intact. Condor is the name of the game here rising above the treacly material (when it does pass into wish fulfillment territory it can induce a healthy volley of eye rolls) but ably supported by a fine cast (Cathcart should get her own spinoff of movies) you can forgive the lovesick bromides & departures from reality (you got into how many Ivy League schools & you're still complaining?) to enjoy this confectionery for what it is; comfort food for the eyes.","7","masonfisk"," THANKS FOR ALL THE LOVE...!

"4128","I don't understand the screenwriting for any of these movies. I think they realized that Gen Z loves daydreamy and romantic montages on tiktok, so they decided to put random ones in this movies that are completely unnecessary and don't further the plotline at all. The montage of them traveling and being cute/existing in New York was sooo long. It didn't add anything of value to the movie. I thought this during most scenes.I know that they filmed this movie a while ago. Netflix must have been excited to capitalize on the success of the first movie and filmed the sequels as fast as possible.The closing scene where Lara Jean's dad gets married to Trina and ""Dancing in the Moonlight"" is actually somewhat enjoyable, but that's really the only scene. Also, why did we need three versions of the Beginning Middle End song? Why??Again, great trailer. Really made me think that the movie was going to be watchable. Who edits the trailers anyway?

The third movie, the plot could have been more interesting but it felt like it was desperately trying to be cool and fresh and edgy but it was a meh, I actually just skipped a few scenes. Although I'm older, so I guess it will appeal to the younger audience.

"4135","What is absolutely funny, cliché, romantic, cheesy and sad. Also, it just came out!! To all the boys I've loved before : always and forever. Lana Condor and Noah Centineo gave us one hell of a parting movie. After 2 movies of love and heartache and a whole ass rollercoaster of emotions, from fake love to true love the third movie brings us to the finale, the ending, the senior year of high school.First off, let's talk about the start of the movie, Lara Jean's in Seoul Korea during spring break, it has very beautiful sceneries. The whole family's together and the three sisters are also all together, it's just very pretty, plus our little Kitty falls in love with a Korean boy.After the break, they all come back to America, while Margo goes back to Scotland for college, however sadly during the whole movie, we don't get to see Josh or John Ambrose, even tho most of us really liked Josh's friendship with LJ, at least I know I did. Speaking of side characters, Ross effing Butler plays Kavinsky's friend and a very cute somewhat of a boyfriend to Chirs(tine) who goes by Trevor.As for our also loveable and favorite side characters, Chris and Lucas are very prominent throughout the movie and we also get to see a pretty nice and different side of Gen. Chris is actually attending school, having a pretty good social life and being the great friend she is to LJ,as for Lucas he's still the funny side character we've all grown to love, and speaking of Gen remember in the last part of the 2nd movie, she actually held to her promise, and acted pretty nice towards LJ. So that we have a problem with the writing as the writer dismissed and ignored the appearance and development of the side the characters like they were being built in the last two movies in vain.Due to the filming not being held under the realm of the COVID, the seniors get to experience an awesome prom and a senior trip to New York City, where we get to see them fall in love with the city and get even closer to each other. Also we gotta mention the animations used in this movie as it gave us an exciting experience for the visuals.If the cheesiness of this isn;t enough we get to see LJ and Kavinsky struggle to think of a future after highschool, they don't have a specific favorite song, or dance, or even a meet cute. We get to see them fall in love and get mad at one another, and then like all good romcom endings it ends with happiness and all struggles overcomed, but it's really what the movie is about and it's essence and showing the struggles of being a senior in love and having to think of what the future beholds. And of course this moments are required to be told, as the struggle is one of the main basis that surely happens to all relationships, also to help it to continue.The acting was corny from all of the actors I don't know exactly what's the reason for that, maybe the pandemic put pressure on them.That is what we watch romantic comedies for, for the movie itself, so what I really suggest is leaving everything right now and binge watching the whole tiology of this beautiful cliche and cheesy lovable movie.","4","mohamedmahmoudgalalmahmoud"," Cliché and lazy

The 3rd really is about not a lot, nothing really happens. The film is just a series of ""rom-com"" scenes sewed together where nothing really happens and the conflict is just blandly predictable.Condor does her best to be cute and charismatic to save the film but unfortunately that's not enough to save this boring film.

"4141","I feel like the 3rd movie in a franchise (apart from Harry Potter and Avengers of course) is always so slow and feels like a filler for the unfortunate sequel to come.Lara Jean and Noah plan to spend their college years together and this final year of high school is literally Lara deciding whether or not Berkley is the one for her .... and then you have other insignificant subplots like Chrissy and her on/off boyfriend, Lara's Dad remarrying and Peter and his birth dad reconnecting (sort of).The dialogue and character interaction was kinda dry compared to the last two movies - Noah's character was basically put on auto pilot. I mean, where was his cute and funny charm from the first film? Did someone he love die in between the 2nd and 3rd film? Character relationships didn't seem to be going anywhere and it was like watching paint dry -- no development whatsoever. Peter and Lara's relationship development never got anywhere just like pushing jelly up a hill.The main thing I disliked was making out like losing your virginity at 17/18 is the most important thing a boy and girl should do before they graduate high school. Having sex in order to commemorate a relationship and make the bond stronger is utter bull-faeces. The idea of the couple in this franchise was supposed to be cheesy like the 80s movies they reference a lot -- adding those few shots which insinuated the sex, lost that recurring theme.Moreover, the film was unnecessarily long. I feel like they coulda cut all the silly montages such as the NY trip because really, a city's environment shouldn't be the ONLY reason one moves to a college in said city. Very random for her to just choose NYC just because she met a few ""cool"" hipsters and helped carry a sofa from a party onto the New York subway. Good music but it barely carried the scenes. And finally, I get that kids' use their phones A LOT in 2021 but enough of the weird phone screen views - there's just too much exposition.Overall, the ""should I choose college or Peter"" plot was longed out and coulda easily been done in 20mins.","4","safirahu"," ""To All the Boys: Never Again""

"4142","LJ and Peter throughout this movie navigates the struggle that comes with a life altering decision. Their romantic lives are turned upside down when LJ's application is turned down. Throughout the almost 2 hour runtime, we see the the pair trying and failing to weave each other into their futures before ultimately coming to terms with the reality of the situation.These movies have always been about more than just the pairs romantic relationship, which is quite refreshing. As we see LJ also balance her home life and the challenges that come from new and exciting developments. This allows LJ to be more than just Peter's girlfriend. She has agency and it's been fulfilling seeing her come into her own.A personal gripe I have, is the ""always and forever,"" conclusion and the arrogant attitude of how their relationship will survive because ""they aren't like other couples.""Ultimately the movies biggest weakness comes from its nearly 2 hour runtime. The characters have almost nothing to do, but the biggest strength of the teenage romance genre is the romance and the pairs chemistry makes it ALMOST worthwhile.","5","davidadesegun"," 2,942 miles

"4145","""To All the Boys: Always and Forever"" is a Comedy - Drama movie in which we watch Lara Jean and Peter making plans about their future while they are expecting their results from their college applications. Their future is very fragile and they both have to work very hard to continue together.Since I had already watched the two previous movies I knew what to expect from this one too but I have to admit that it was better than what I was expecting. Despite that for one more time the plot was missing, the movie had some good scenes but it was very predictable. The direction which was made by Michael Fimognari, it was average and since the plot was predictable and we did not watch anything new, made the movie boring. To sum up, I have to say that ""To All the Boys: Always and Forever"" is a classic teenage movie to spend your time with but do not expect much from it.","5","Thanos_Alfie"," Predictable...

As a Tom Clancy movie, based on a book with established characters and canon, a 1 isn't a low enough rating. It has nothing to do with the book, and little to do with the Clancy universe beyond a couple of names. It's nothing more than a cheap cash grab using the Clancy name. People need to either come up with original IPs, or at least attempt to stick a little closer to the namesake material.","1","rikakiah-68522"," Either make a Clancy movie or don't

"4153","This could not have been a bigger disappointment it they tried. Tom Clancy deserves much better. This can't even be called an adaptation, because it had nothing to do with the novel. The acting was wooden the plot was weak and ludicrous and even MBJ seemed to be phoning it in, which I am very sorry to say. The technical inaccuracies made it difficult to even enjoy the action, which really wasn't that enjoyable anyway. Basically, this could have been a better movie if they had left it to a couple of shaved wombats for writing and directing. As a John Clark fan from way back, it was the absolute worst way that they could have told his story. MBJ could have knocked it out of the park if he had something better to work with.","1","demoxpert"," Sorry Tom

2: He is/was a Navy SEAL.Tom Clancy is rolling in his grave at this terrible adaptation.Side note: I love reading the reviews from people saying that the only reason people are giving this movie terrible reviews is because they can't handle an African American as the main character.

"4155","I loved Tom Clancy books and movies growing up and I always wanted them to make Without Remorse into a movie since the book was so good. I was thoroughly disappointed. The only commonality are some of the characters and the title. They could have just changed the character names and the title and not claim this to be a Tom Clancy film. Either stick with the plot of the books and do them justice or don't claim to do a Tom Clancy film. The plot they did use instead was stale and not what I would expect for a major release. It was more in the direct to DVD league.It also seems like they did not have very good technical advisors... or geographers. The opening scene takes place in a landlocked city and yet Kelly and his team infiltrate via water. The uniforms are also very inconsistent... Greer is wearing a commanders cap in at least one place which is different than what her rank would be. Since the writers took so much liberty with realism, they just wrote her in as a SEAL instead of a more plausible role like being some sort of subject matter expert attached to Kelly's team. I'm not one to dismiss the idea that there are women out there capable of becoming Navy SEALs, but I would expect the to be built like a crossfit games winner instead of the stereotypical model. I know this comes off as nitpicking, but the filmmakers should know their audience. Tom Clancy's books and previous films were always very detailed and realistic and this film was far from that.The one positive part of the film was Michael B. Jordan's performance and the only reason I gave this any stars. I was excited to see him in the role when it was announced. He did well with what he had to work with. It is a real shame. Had they stuck to the plot of the book and took the details seriously, I would be excited for Rainbow Six. Now I just hope they forget they planned on doing it.","2","lrm-33361"," Disappointed...

"4158","I haven't read Without Remorse, yet considering Amazon started business selling books, why can't the writers of these productions read one if they're going to say it's based on one! Tom Clancy was the master of the techno-thriller, mixing elements of science fiction, political thriller and spy genres, albeit Clancys extensive research helped readers understand foreign militaries and his plots eerily echoed real events to the degree rumours circulated the CIA thought he was a mole.This film has none of his subtlety. Yes, it's normal for books to change when made into a film, but all that seems left of Clancys work are a few names.On the plus side, Jamie Bell does get the sneaky company man role down. His spook demeanour in relation to the other soldiers is probably the most in keeping with Clancy.MBJ makes a decent effort as the lead, who in typical Hollywood fashion is pretty trigger happy, an amazing shot with grenades, but never seems to be in much peril, while Jodie Turner-Smith seems to only be allowed one emotion.On the other side, I'm not sure if Guy Pearce was just tired all the way through, but compared to the usual energy he shows in his other films, he was putting me to sleep.The cinematography is dark at places really hard to see what is going on. I get fighting in the dark adds to the effect, but I ended up watching one of the early fight scenes three times and only found out what had happened later in the film. It shouldn't be that hard.The post credits scene should have filled me with joy, but considering everything I'd just seen, it just left me more sad.","3","feyipuk"," Stop using Tom Clancys name if it's not Clancy!

"4168","If the entire crew involved in the production of this abomination have no remorse, they ought to have. Plenty of remorse. For subjecting an already traumatized public to this collection of pixelized garbage. This silly shoot'em-up deserves to be taken out back, shot (without remorse) and buried in an anonymous plot, never to be mentioned again ... or quarantined forever in Yucca Mountain along with all other radioactive waste.Re the ""movie"": There wasn't a lot of character development or laying the premise for a good story. Scratch that. There was none. Plot holes are abundant and the story does not follow in most instances. It would have behooved the writers to have read some real life accounts of spies and covert action before contriving a clearly comically simple but hackneyed revenge plot using characters out of a novel they clearly did not bother to read. Clancy would by no means win any literature awards but at least he usually got the technical and operational details right, usually to a fault. This is by far the worst adaptation of any Tom Clancy novel. The acting by most of the cast is wooden and phoned in. It's sad the only ""Guy"" with any real convincing portrayal is the villain. Throughout the movie you'll be going - What?? Why??? How??? It really is that bad. It's like a bad Avengers movie met Get Smart on a 007 set.Unless action IS the plot - eg The Raid, Extraction... Action and violence should be used sparingly and to further the plot of the movie. There should also be some sense and purpose to the action sequences. This movie - fuggeddaboutit.For example. And by no means an exhaustive list of ""huh why??"" forehead slapping moments that make one yell at the poor TV, but a quick sampler. Spoilers ahead.Why would anyone think T-boning a car, AT AN AIRPORT, setting it on fire and jumping into it would be the best course of interrogating someone? And then jumping out and promptly EXPECTING to get arrested. What would you do with any info gained from that theatrical exercise in futility? Wait till the end of the prison sentence to act upon it? This is the type of plan an experienced SEAL would hatch? One that depends on the police pulling over a diplomatic vehicle?? Why would a nearly empty plane be operating with the interior lights on, when even full passenger planes have their lights dimmed? Why was the first thought of a team that's fully geared up with parachutes and about to HAHO out of such a plane decide : No!! We're going to go down with the plane rather than jump, especially when a missile strikes the plane? Who thinks that two black team members can easily blend in covertly into .... *ahem*.. Russia? How easy is it to just ""disappear"" after shooting up a city block... in Russia? And if the team was betrayed from the start and never expected to survive, how is it they made their exfil, presuming their treasonous paymasters were in on the whole plan from the beginning?As a wise former president observed many a year ago: ""Rarely is the question asked: is our children learning?"" Clearly the millennial generation writing these crappy movies still has a ways to go. Despite having a perfectly decent plot laid out for them in the book they still managed to royally screw up the movie - I mean how hard should it be really to make Rambo meets Death Wish?","1","World-viewer"," Silly, trite, revenge shoot-em-up.

"4169","A generic shoot-'em-up that Hollywood used to do with Westerns ever since they began making movies. It doesn't matter that there's the military, espionage and geopolitical conspiracies involved in the Tom Clancy variation on the formula; it's always the same thing. The baddie and his red herring are so obvious that one of them might as well be wearing a black hat. But, sure, the action is standard, if darkly lit, and Michael B. Jordan fits the part of a muscular star to recognizably pose between the rest of the interchangeable tropes. Maybe you'll even find ""Without Remorse"" a bit fun with him not playing by the rules, out for revenge as he is. For crying out loud, we even get a mid-credits scene setting up a franchise.When a movie is this dull, I start desperately looking for something to be worth my attention. One character makes a point regarding the Cold War having brought Americans together, whereas now without a common enemy one half sees the other half as the enemy. That comes too late to matter, though. There's also the business of Jordan's character telling his enemies to say his murdered wife's name. That got me thinking about the SayHerName campaign, but the picture doesn't do anything with its star being an African American, and in one sequence he takes out an entire squad of Russian police officers who are just doing their jobs. So, yeah, there's nothing here.","3","Cineanalyst"," Someone Should be Remorseful for This

"4198","I turned on a Tom Clancy movie thinking I was going to watch one of his intriguing international conflict movies with men fighting evil directly and with strength of mind, body and a decent morality. I turned on this movie and the first 10 minutes shows a Navy SEAL team with a 90 lb black woman as the SEAL teams commanding officer in the field! I don't care if she's black, white, purple, green, blue, whatever, this ridiculous looking scenario with Navy SEAL military equipment on this woman's body looking silly and giant compared to her frame just to make some kind of social engineering statement?!? Then it switches to the United States in the Pentagon where it finally shows her in a Navy SEAL uniform with ribbons on her chest and the seal insignia that very few men have the mental and physical capability to earn, much less a 90 lb woman unless you change what it means to be a seal and at that point the whole intriguing, glorious excellence and dedication of these men who pushed their God-given strength and dedication to the limits and beyond with the desire to protect the men , women and children of this nation from Evil tyrants who would force their will upon Americans, is belittled and lost. There is one scene where this woman goes face to face with the antagonist, in a scene where she is supposed to be popping up her chest and looking big and bad to threaten this man who is doing things that could cast her men in a bad light. That was one of the most silly, ridiculous scenes I've ever encountered in a Bee movie much less a movie that's been built up as much as this one has. I had to turn the TV off at that point because I was so embarrassed for this poor actress who I'm sure could do great in a role as an actual woman, in the strength of righteous womanhood. Movie makers, you've not only lost your connection to the people of this nation, you've lost your connection to reality as God designed it, obviously, clearly and without question. If you want to play games with deluding yourselves into thinking you do not live in a world with fixed spiritual, physical and social laws by which humanity finds true relationship and true meaning and true purpose under the God that created us, have at it! If you want to make skits for yourself all day and all night where guys become female impregnated aliens, do it, but leave us out of it and please get some people to make movies again that have excellent righteousness versus evil thematic elements, where men reveal the reason for and purpose for their being, bearing Authority and strength for the blessing and protection of others, not some made up morality and reality where dogs are supposed to marry cats and a lion can declare himself an elephant legally.","1","deutero-49703"," What has movie making come to?

"4214","With its formulaic modus operandi, ""Without Remorse"" tragically conveyed the feel of true Remorse. Amazon Studio's latest venture into Tom Clancy's universe turned out to be a colossal disappointment! Atrocious Writing, Mediocre Performances, and Conspicuous Enfeeblement in terms of presenting its Action made the entire experience bitterer!Right from its introductory sequence; I realized, something amiss. In spite of the fact that it immediately gets underway with Gunfight & Explosions, the particular way in which they handle all of it created an impression of nonchalance!Excluding some gratifying moments that clearly demonstrate Cinematographic flair; in other parts, it's got its own set of problems! Such as the Score; frequently masking pivotal parts of every other conversation. Furthermore, Lighting in certain scenes appears to be too dim. Likewise, the Screenplay inflicted with apathy often enough! Translating into an uninspiring array of events.Speaking of Performances, I find them to be average at best. Michael B. Jordan is a known performer and we are all aware of his capabilities as an actor. With such shoddy script in hand; there was nothing he could do. From my point of view, the character of John Kelly/Clark deserved greater representativity!All things considered; personally this hasn't been a pleasant viewing, not a bit! Efforts had been made to do things differently but they failed to bring into play two principal constituents of any Action Flick; i.e. Thrill and Vehemence!","2","mikbanerjee1"," The Character of John Clark Deserved Better!

"4215","John Clark, or Kelly as the character starts out is a Navy Seal.Admiral Jim Greer's normally played by the superb James Earl Jones is not featured in this, but the characters niece is, who is John Clark's team leader.Jamie Bell, plays Ritter, who we all know is a future corrupt CIA Director of Intelligence.... Maybe he will be good before his corruption in later books, but no, this story has him outed as a villain in the first spoken scenes.Here ends any relation to the Tom Clancy storylines. And my interest in the story wavered further and further as the film progressed.Add in a few action sequences, lots of meaningless jibber jabber to set up a plot line that has descended from retiring seal, to covert ops, although for which agency is strangely lacking. Maybe it's cia, but none of it fits any notion of a military or intelligence structure.Acting: Jamie Bell lacks any depth, motivation and background. The actress playing Greer is to be avoided, basically, a wooden character with presence which isn't utilised at all, seems like a missed opportunity. Michael B Jordan, is limited to silent operative and angry husband and superman, but there is no depth.Just weird.... Thats some of the actions and set peices, bits of floor that fall away, climbing into burning cars to interview suspects, arrests that don't make sense, threats and hostility for show., when Kelly is imprisoned for unknown reasons, no trial, with russian mobsters. The panache of Clancy is nowhere to be seen, what we see is corruption everywhere, action scenes which are just plain non sensical, such as Kelly vs 3 Prision Guards in full riot gear with helmets, shields and batons, you can guess it's never going to be a fair match, Kelly is of course an overwhelming opponent.I honestly couldn't tell you what i detested more about this film.... The acting.... 2/10. The story 1/10. The identity politics, 0/10.Overall, the key to Tom Clancy novels making it well to the screen, is to have some tenet of link back to the books, some have been very faithful, HFROctober, Patriot Games, etc. Some have been weak - SOAFears.... Some have been unfaithful, the recent amazon Jack Ryan shows, but were true to the moral of an Analyst working their way up.... This film, i can only conclude, had the title and character names of some well known Clancy characters, but none of the substance or integrity or story.... Add in an act of war by America on Russian, a Jet Plane crash in which everyone survives with no injuries.... It's just garbage and not fit for the film title and characters names.I feel sorry for the careers that could well be ruined by this film. The only reason why i don't give this film 1/10, is that it's not a home movie, and it gets a 2/10 because to be fair on the cell sequence, the use of water and M B Jordan's physique is impressive.If you decide to watch this..... Good luck.","2","briandickie-39038"," This is not any relation to a Tom Clancy book of the same title.

There is almost no plot and what plot there is is the most contrite drivel you could imagine. This is a movie you have seen at least two dozen times and out of those 23 were a better movie that this. The acting is stiff, even from the usually fantastic Michael B Jordan, there is zero character development and you have no investment in how anything turns out. There is literally probably less than 10 minutes of action and what is there is unimaginative and boring. I love action movies and think that even a lot of lower budget poorly made ones at least have some worthwhile parts, but with this movie I can honestly say that there isn't one thing I could point to in this movie that had any entertainment value.

"4255","This movie was terrible, after all the AD'S they invested in I though it would be entertaining but frankly this movie is just dull. The acting is horrible none of the actors are believable or I even cared for, the script is slow and boring, the movie drags on and on with no action (all the Action scenes are in the trailer).For highly trained special ops teams they really lack any skills I mean they can't even hit a one guy in a straight line with 10 people..... we all know seals are highly trained and would never miss.The characters were so dull especially the female seal leader (lol), MBJ, ...plus everyone else .... a wooden stick on ropes in place of her character would of been more entertaining seriouslyI won't go into any more detail since some of the other reviews did a much better job summing it up then me...Anyways this movie sucks, expected more for using the Tom Clancy name, nothing like the book or other rainbow series, cash grab off Clancys name, I mean they have a BOOK which is basically a SCRIPT to work off how can you go wrong? Did they bother to read it?Suggest to AVOID watch the trailer for the action scenes and be done with it.","2","pipo-"," Terrible.

"4269","Wow! What an incredibly bad movie adaptation of a great book! I'm glad Tom Clancy is no longer alive to see what they did to one of his great stories. The young man who plays ""John Kelly/Clark"" is a good actor who I have seen in several roles. I like his talent. There were some other good actors in the movie not including Guy Pearce. First problem the story does not resemble the book which was an outstanding idea. Second John Clark has been in so many of the film adaptations and in the Clancy novels as a white male that I found it a little distracting to now have a younger black man in the role. I think he would have been outstanding in the role of Greer. Greer was horribly cast in this movie and I won't go into the whole a woman as a navy seal and team commander. Hollywood attempting to tell everyone that a woman can do everything a man can do, but hey men can't do everything that women do. I know Hollywood won't be happy until men are playing the role of expectant mothers. I don't even want to think about that! I was so disappointed by this movie but it won't surprise me when everyone gets an academy award for this movie.

It literally has nothing to do with the books or the characters.One, John Kelly aka Clark's wife and daughter are not only alive, but his daughter is married to his second in command Ding Chavez. In the books, the origin of John Clark, has him in his mid to late 20's with his story ending with him being married to Pam and having a daughter on the way. The Rainbow Group happens a little over 20 years later with his daughter being married to his younger second in command.Currently, John Clark is in his early 70's and is in charge of his new group of operators , ""The Campus"" and Jack Ryan Jr. Is one of his agents.Nothing about the movie makes sense as it relates to the ongoing books.While I appreciate they have to make changes, they would have been better off setting this up in the late 70's or early 80's.Spoiler but not reallyThe movie on it's own, regardless of the books was also ridiculous on it's own. How many people gather around in a street while an active sniper is shooting? How many cops simply walk around in an active shooter sequence when two of their own get shot.

"4319","Overall, I found Without Remorse disappointing. While a mediocre action film that was mildly entertaining, this was not by any imagination an adaptation of Tom Clancy's Without Remorse.Probably one of Clancy's finest books, Sheridan and Staples manage to shred anything remotely close to the novel. Rather than a realistic portrayal of a man filled with rage and bent on revenge as he walks the tightrope between self-destruction and duty, we get a stylized military version of John Wick.Don't get me wrong, I love the John Wick movies. They're entertaining fun not to take too seriously. Without Remorse (the movie) hits those same notes. But that's not why Clancy fans have waited decades to see this story come to the screen.But if this movie hits the same John Wick notes, then why is it mildly entertaining? The film takes itself seriously, and it is hard to accept. Not too mention some questionable choices from the writers and director that are just hard to swallow.Poor logistical choices for locations, ridiculous military representations that make Godzilla movies seem like Pentagon training videos, poor casting, and a Swiss cheese script keep Without Remorse from being memorable.Stefano Sollima was absolutely the wrong director for this project. Based solely on his work on Sicario: Day of the Soldado, the acceptable sequel to Sicario, Sollima is a quasi cohort for Sheridan. But Sollima lacks the sophistication to truly tell a compelling story and directs this picture as a Sheridan lapdog instead. Frankly, Sollima stinks and should stick to television.Tyler Sheridan approached the adaptation with a bug gnawing an idea in the back of his head. He's currently developing a television series about the first female Navy Seal. Obviously a fantasy piece that's already been done with G. I. Jane, Sheridan believes he can put a new spin on the idea. Here he tests the waters with Without Remorse, and the water is cold.Karen Greer, played by Jodie Turner-Smith, is a one-dimensional piece of wood. And Turner-Smith has as much range as a squirt gun. Not too mention she doesn't come close to the type of woman that could prevail as a Navy Seal. A miss by all accounts.Jordan as the lead John Clark managed to breathe as much life into a dead-eyed version of the character from the book he could muster. Frankly, the writers and director set him up for failure, but he somehow still came out unscathed.Without Remorse is filled with implausible action sequences, a plot we've seen a million times, stiff acting, and a predictable ending that doesn't even try. Three stars is being nice and is for Jordan only.","3","CryptoGuy"," Buckle Up for a Mediocre Ride

"
"4332","This film has been heavily marketed by Amazon and I have finally found the time to watch it and here is my review for Without Remorse. The premise of the film sees an elite soldier go on the hunt after his wife is killed.Main Character
Over the last few years Michael B Jordan has become a real film star and that shows here as he manages to add a little bit to this completely bland character. Jordan just has the presence of a movie star and it is sometimes exciting to see him take down bad guys are here. But the issue is that this character is incredibly dull and boring, I never once cared about him and his motivations despite the fact I clearly should. A weaker actor then Jordan would have been totally useless but he manages to save it a little bit.Supporting Characters
This film has an impressive supporting cast. Jodie Turner-Smith, Jamie Bell & Guy Pearce are in the film and it feels very similar to the main character in that these actors do a decent job in their roles but their characters are so basic and generic it is unreal. When you have a talented cast, it feels worse that their talent has been wasted and that these roles might as well have gone to up and coming actors who could have got themselves recognised a bit.Story
The story is here is as bland and generic as possible. It has some similar vibes to a film like John Wick but that has way more depth and unique world building to it that this film didn't. I didn't care about any of the characters and any twist and turn is incredibly predictable from minute one to the final minute and it just did nothing for me.Script
The script also did nothing. It takes itself incredibly seriously and misses the mark. The drama is dull and not conveyed well enough and there is a lack of balance in terms of the tone and it just causes this film to be incredibly forgettable.Style
The style is possibly the most important part of an action film and this film does it okay. There are some decent action sequences that are well performed and that is crucial to any sort of entertainment that is here. But there isn't any action scene that really wowed me, it just feels a bit safe and forgettable and that is how the majority of people will see this film.Overall
Overall, Without Remorse is a poor action film. It is clear that this is meant to be a start of a Tom Clancy Film Franchise but this is a bad start and there are plenty of better action films out there to sink your teeth into.","3","alindsay-al"," A Poor Generic Action Film

I will just say that I agree with others - this feels like another heartless Steven Segal flick with no humor or one-liners to look forward to. I play the games and was looking forward to the story and hopefully tieing this into Jack Ryan. Instead, I hope they either scap this and start over with better writing, story, and directing, or they really make a lot of changes for the sequel.3 stars for the MBJ shirtless scenes (lol), and the post credit scene only because of the lead off into what can only be a better movie.","3","eric-limbacher"," Without feeling ... just bad

"4345","Right at the beginning, one of the production companies is WEED ROAD. That pretty much says it all. Apparently they were smoking quite a bit when they made this travesty. Lately Hollywood has been doing a few things I really hate:
1 - Calling a movie an 'adaptation' of a Novel, when it's clear no one involved has read the novel, or cares enough to get past a few names.2 - Factless and Woke. Oh, it's so nice that Clark's CO was a woman. Except for ONE SMALL DETAIL - There are no women in the SEALS. No matter how much Hollywood wants this to happen - it hasn't happened yet. SEAL training is the hardest in any branch of the US Military.3 - PC. Which goes hand in hand with the woke crap that is killing movies. Can't anyone write a good woman character (SEE: JUNE in HANDMAID'S TALE for one prime example) without her being perfect? And why does every villain lately have to be a white male? As a white mail, I'm feeling more and more alienated by this. Fortunately I read a lot, so if I decided to simply stop going to the movies or watching any TV show after 2018, I'll be fine.Onto this movie. It sounds more like David Hagberg's ""Retribution"" where US Seals are being attacked in the US because of the attack on Osama Bin Laden. Sound familiar? Because it's the plot of this movie, not Without Remorse, which has a Navy Seal, an unmarried Navy Seal, whose girlfriend, NOT wife, gets murdered by drug dealers. He does get wounded and survive to go on to have a private war in Baltimore while he's training to rescue POW's in Viet Nam. So what happened here? Really the book would have made a better mini-series. But whoever 'adapted' this needs a good swift kick in the butt. This was just trash.","1","mhorg2018"," Weed Road says it all!

Couldn't they make up their minds on how to end it? I thought it was done but then it wasn't and then instead of just going into that good night they came back with more so that they could maybe do what? Make another bad film using the same cast?

First off the story is non existent, Russians vs Americans but nowhere near as good as it sounds, next up the the characters are like comic book characters, here's the bad guy, here's the good guy, now watch some awful action scenes. And finally the acting and dialogue in this film are simply laughable, several clearly dubbed lines and the emotions displayed in scenes where somebody is meant to be shot or feeling pain are so fake it hurts. The sound of shots being fired is better than any comedy I've seen all year, little pew pew pinging noises, it's hilarious.

"4392","I haven't read many Tom Clancy novels, but I love ""Tom Clancy's Without Remorse"" the book. I do not love ""Tom Clancy's Without Remorse"" the movie. It has nothing to do with the book's plot or characters, it's not set in the same time period, and I'm pretty sure these people made a generic action movie, but they were afraid that nobody would see it, so they changed the main character's name, slapped poor Tom Clancy's name on it (because Tom won't object to it ever since he stopped needing oxygen) and hoped that people would watch it based on false titling. I hate this movie for that reason. If they had called this movie literally anything else, I would have given it at least 6 stars. It's a 6 star movie, but being labeled as ""Tom Clancy's Without Remorse"", 1 star is too much. But I couldn't tell you how much you shouldn't expect to actually see a faithful adaptation of a great novel without at least putting a star on. So.....be warned.

"4417","I have never written a review on this website, but this movie was so asinine I had to make an account. I understand they can't use the real plot for Clancy, Vince flynn books etc. Because the plots are too complex and actually interesting for the average movie watcher to understand. However the plot for without remorse was so far fetched I had to take a moment to process if this was a satire. To think a navy seal could just murder a foreign dignitary at the airport in front of everyone and one.. not be shot and two just not have immense press coverage and absolutely zero chance of being released from jail for a goose chase. But the worst thing of all in this movie is how the CIA is portrayed. Tom Clancy made his fortune off of writing about the CIA.. has anyone heard of jack ryan? How could they make the CIA look so incompetent that they wouldn't realize a plot to stage a war for Christ's sake!? The CIA director was horrendous and that agent was so shameful. Don't you think that the CIA people would know more about espionage than a Navy SEAL..? After all it is there jobs! There was no communication between the cia and the president or any government about a literal war with Russia lol.. What do you think the CIA's job is?? To say this is tied in with jack Ryan is embarrassing. Yeah of course the navy seals are deployed into Russia without anyone having to talk to the president..but I guess that's why this is a basic streaming movie and not an HBO original or something.. they couldn't afford any writers that knew jack s*** about foreign policy or espionage and just hoped people would like the action. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that the gun play and how the seals communicated was slightly realistic at some points.","2","mertesjeff"," Shameful to Clancy's memory!

"4472","""Tough good guy seeks revenge after wife and child are murdered"" is a stock movie plot that's probably been done way too many times, but there are ways to make it interesting. This film doesn't. It just delivers a cookie-cutter revenge plot, mixes in a few dozen more well-worn tropes, and plods its way to the end.The big reveal and the twist ending were both predictable from early on and significant parts of the plot didn't make sense. The story itself felt disjointed, lurching from one set-piece action scene to another. It felt very much as if the writers had given up and were just phoning it in.The target audience is clearly people who like guns and soldiers way too much, but the filmmakers then made the baffling decision to throw in a Black female Navy SEAL commander, infuriating and alienating the very demographic that the movie was made for. The character, incidentally, is perhaps the only one in the film who has any kind of screen presence. She's not believable as a military bad-ass, but she is at least interesting to watch, not something that can be said for any other character in the film.The same apathy that infected the writers seems to have spread to most of the actors. Even the often-excellent Guy Pearce looks like a man who's mostly thinking about his paycheck. Jodie Turner-Smith does a capable job with few words and subtle gestures, but she's probably in the wrong movie. Michael B. Jordan just seems numbed, not so much by personal tragedy as by dull writing.

"4478","Having read every Tom Clancy book, and been waiting for a big screen adaptation of ""Without Remorse"" since it released. I was looking forward to this. Boy was I disappointed. The decision to not follow the book was the biggest mistake that any studio could make. The change in character for John Kelly/Clark is easy to go with. Michael B. Jordon fits the role and can sell that level of angst and determination that John Kelly/Clark portrays in the book. However the change in story does a HUGE disservice to the source material and the author. I would not be surprised if the Clancy estate does not give permission for any more of his books after this. After the backlash that this movie is receiving, I would not be surprised to see the studios next movie"" Rainbow 6"" follow the book more closely.","1","jtighe-44630"," Bad decisions lead to disappointment

I'm a huge Tom Clancy fan and have been waiting for a good Clancy film that centers on his legendary character John Clark, Well, I'm still waiting. This film was not it at all. This cannot be called a Tom Clancy film as there is no representation to his story, character development of his attention to detail with regards to the military.This is some woke PC grade school level play pretending to be Tom Clancy. The depth of the writers research must have been reading the slipcover for the book ""Without Remorse"" and gone no further.If you are a Tom Clancy fan most definitely skip this pathetic cash grab on Clancy's name.I you are a fan of good filmmaking or good script writing, then this one is not for you either.

I don't see why they would spend the money to get the rights to the book and not adapt it.Yes, the book is set in the 70's and deals with Vietnam War but Marvel has show you can modernize a dated story and keep it's spirit with Ironman. This is just another attempt at virtual signaling by Hollywood by race swapping John Clark.The movie tease that it will go from Without Remorse to Rainbow Six. They going to skip over the years Clark worked with Ryan. Given that Rainbow Six (the book) takes place later in Clark's life and when he no longer an operator, I expect that movie will only be a Tom Clancy story in name only too.","1","ghostsm"," John Clark you are not.

"4483","As said in other reviews, this strays very far from the source material. John Clark is now John Kelly, Jim Greer is now Karen Greer, which is good, because the original characters are now not sullied by the taint of this festering tur.... They do make Karen, Jim's niece. Michael B. Jordan, who is ordinarily good in anything, is almost emotionless and wooden, even mourning his wife and baby is momentary and unbelievable. Watch it, then rewind and imagine him on the toilet making that same face and noise while having an uncomfortable bowel movement. They are interchangeable. Jodie Turner Smith, ordinarily gorgeous and good, delivers every line like she's either reading it for the first time, or channeling Don King touting ""double shock power"" (which, FYI, is way more entertaining, look it up on YouTube.) She can't even order someone to take a drink without it sounding boring, and almost childish. She has no energy, no emotion, and is easily the weakest part of an already weak movie. Her agent must be legendary to get her acting roles after this. There was more emotion in the dead behind the eyes twins in ""Valerian."" Jamie Bell and Guy Pierce are underutilized, and one dimensional. The action pieces are boring, predictable, and at times unbelievably stupid. Like setting a Russian Ambassador's car on fire, and then climbing in it to talk. Even the ending and ""twist"" are predictable. It takes a well thought out Tom Clancy book, and makes it a modern Blaxploitation revenge flick set against a minor political backdrop. Actually I wish it was blaxploitation, it might have been better with Rudy Ray Moore.","2","kdoc13"," Shockingly awful.

And why is this important - because alongside with Jack Ryan, John Kelly is the other most important character in the whole Clancy's universeIf you own the copyright - then simply follow the book and you'll have successful movie.

Other than the title and a few character names, the plot does not do justice to the book. Sadly, what viewers are being robbed of is, the book explores Clark's tragically dark past, Pam's struggles, and how he ultimately becomes Clark and the movie does not. As Clark avenges Pam's death alone in the book by stalking Pam's killers, the movie leaps to some weird USA vs Russia plot and misses the boat all together. For people unfamiliar with the Clancy books, the movie will probably be OK, but regardless, the original book plot would have made a much better movie for everyone.","2","tjbrill"," Missed Opportunity

Later on he drives a vehicle into water off a pier and sinks with the car and again holds his breath longer than a sea turtle could and escapes. All this while evading bullets from high powered rifles throughout the movie. And of course the plot is typical and easy to figure out.

The whole airplane sequence could have been omitted to keep the pace in a more efficient order.Despite being pretentious in its criticism, it tries to convey the assumption that just because you defeat an ""evil"" empire does not mean you will replace it with a good one.","5","nakrugt"," Imperialist legionnaires vs imperialist legionnaires

John Clark is supposed to kick butt and while MBJ had moments I blame the lackluster script. Adding LT Commander Karen Greer as a character also was offensive and ruined any realism. There are currently NO female Navy Seals, much less a team lead reasonably high officer. Her character was pure Hollywood to be able to say they added a black woman. Every time she was on screen, it took me out of the movie and reminded me that ""politically correct"" was more important than a good movie. All of the characters, to some extent including John Kelly, were incredibly two dimensional and neither relatable or interesting.Obviously the studio paid for the rights to the book but it is just sad that they only used the name to make a C level generic story with bad writing.","2","wgeddings"," Implausible waste of great actors and story

It isn't that the film does not follow the novel's plot that is troubling, but that there is no authorial strength to what is offered.

You never feel real peril or jeopardy.The worst of all is the ending. The explanation for why any of this happened is so lame....so written on a back of a cigarette packet (another 90s reference).....that you think that the world is run by actual idiots as opposed to me calling my brother an idiot (in a jokey way) when he accidentally switched on the electric toothbrush, with toothpaste, before he put the brush in his mouth....no not that type of idiot...the other one.There are scenes in this that are just pointless. The shirt off Michael B Jordan getting ready to box (a nudge and a wink to his role in Creed) but is just....why?I had no empathy for any of the characters in this.If you want to see an army unit do their thing and make it entertaining and almost authentic, check out ""Mosul"".If you want one man non stop action, check out ""Extraction"".There are so so many better films in this genre than this.Really, unless you have a spare box of half eaten cold pizza and a rain soaked Sunday afternoon to kill, there really is no reason to inflict this much waste of time on yourself.","4","mr_sharma"," So disappointing for so so many reasons

This was a very amateur effort, even though they likely had a good budget to work with.There was absolutely no story, one fight scene after the next, one gun scene after the next, and very little content. This was a truly horrible depiction of a Clancy novel. It's probably been since back in the days of Clear and present danger, Patriot Games and Hunt for Red October that any Clancy novel has been translated into a film with a positive outcome.Hollywood just does not seem to be capable of doing it these days asthe characters are too well written in the novels, and these characters were cardboard cutout cartoon type figures.Even Michael B.

The book was during the Vietnam War in the 1970s and this movie, present day. It has a woman Seal commanding the Seal Team. Vietnam era helicopter, the UH-1 ""Iroquois"" helicopter painted in gloss black was in one rescue operation. I think they went dirt cheap on this helicopter rental. Anyways, it is a completely different story. More of a B revenge movie with action. Not a Tom Clancy story. Story did not seem believable to me either.","1","Harry_Wild"," Tom Clancy's With Remorse does not follow his book's storyline of that title.

"4535","After half a dozen movies and a TV series, Hollywood ruins another franchise with forced wokeness. Just turning the white characters into a PoC and the strong male characters into unrealistic women. Why not an origin story of James Greer? He is black and male and a badass. Michael B. Jordan is a just ok actor, not bad, not great. I think he tends to over act. Willem Defoe was perfect as Clark. A mysterious CIA spook who bent the rules to complete covert objectives. In Jack Ryan the series, it was Matice. Just keep it real for God's sake!","2","nickg696"," More wokeness.

"4536","I went into this knowing that it wasn't going to be just like the novel. I even accepted the fact that the bad guys probably wouldn't be drug dealers or the cartel. But what I couldn't have foreseen is how ridiculously unrealistic this would be!Considering how accurate Tom Clancy's novels were, it's an insult to slap Clancy's name on this hot mess! From simple uniform mistakes, to ignoring that police dispatch would run the plates on a foreign diplomatic plates and allow their officers to pull over the vehicle and detain the occupants to the Hollywood staple of suppressors making firearms almost completely silent (even unsurpressed weapons were more quiet than a real suppressor would be) and many other ridiculous scenarios. Throw in the cheesy dialog and over dramatic acting, and this movie seemed more like a satirical comedy, minus the comedy, than a realistic action movie.It would be more entertaining, and productive, to spend nearly 2 hours of your life rearranging the items in your pantry in numerical order by their UPC codes, than wasting that time on this movie!","3","deepc185"," Unwatchable garbage

"4537","This film has no resemblance to the book other than title and main character name. Mr Jordan is a far better actor than he gets to show in this flat actioner.The writing is quite poor, the editing needs work and I am underwhelmed by the director's work.There are a few issues of stretch that hurt the credibility. Seal Trams are led on ops by Lr Commanders or Commanders but they don't go into the field. The field Seals are nearly always enlisted personnel and seasoned NCOs. I am no expert but I am not cognizant of any woman attaining senior officer rank in an operational detachment in the Seals although I would be pleased to be proven wrong. This incredulity impacts Ms Turner's performance which is further hurt by making her very flat as a character. Not surprising that the big baddie is a government senior bureaucrat supported by the arms industry because there are no other threats out there are there?The closing moments were really disappointing showing the whole thing is a set up for a Rainbow Six thing.","5","rchevalier-37303"," The only link to Tom Clancy is the title

In their production meetings, they must have said this is a terrible script- what can we do to save it? Let's just make John Kelly/Clark a black guy, invent a niece for Admiral Greer- make her a co-star, use the Clancy Name, title, and nothing else. The movie absolutely stinks. Rainbow 6 is going to be worse...but I'll never know because you couldn't force me to watch it. Michael Jordan had potential in the role- it's not his fault movie is terrible- but he doesn't save it either.

"4560","As ""Without Remorse"" (2021 release; 109 min.) opens, we are in ""Aleppo, Syria"", and a Navy SEALs team led by John Kelly is making a daring recuse of an FBI operative held captive by the Syrian government. Except that it turns out that the hostage is held by Russians, not Syrians... We then go to ""Washington, DC, 3 months later"" and our hero John Kelly is at a bbq cookout with his highly pregnant wife. In a parallel story, two other SEAL members of that Aleppo mission are viciously murdered... At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel. Let's be clear: the production team went all out with this, and money seemingly was no object. But does that make for a good film? The film is directed by Stefano Sollima, whose previous work includes ""Sicario 2"". Most importantly, the film stars Michael B. Jordan (""Creed"", among many others), and he is in great form throughout. The film brings a nice mix of all-out action scenes and some calmer moments, and also a good number of plot twists (who is really the bad guy here? You might be surprised!). The production sets are top notch. And the original score is from none other than Jonsi (of Sigur Ros). Bottom line: this movie just flew by in no time, and I found it surprisingly entertaining, even if the plot ultimately is rather conventional if not predictable. Frankly, I don't understand the many, many outright negative reviews of this on here. Were you not entertained by this film? I know I was.""Without Remorse"" was supposed to open in theaters last summer, but a little thing called COVID-19 had other plans, and hence the release of this big budget film (like most others) was delayed and delayed, and ultimately Amazon Studios stepped in and bought the distribution rights. The film was just released on Prime Video (where I saw it) and here on Amazon Instant Video. If you are in the mood for a mindless and entertaining Tom Clancy movie, or simply are a fan of Michael B. Jordan, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.","7","paul-allaer"," Enjoyed this wild ride, with Michael B.Jordan in excellent form

"4564","As a fan of the Tom Clancy novels as well as military movies, I was looking forward to this one. However, this movie disappoints on every level from acting to action to gear. Tom Clancy was such a master of technical details, yet this movie got everything wrong. From the horrible flat acting, to the incorrect weapons and gear, to the warzones which look totally fake, and even that odd small European helicopter which somehow carries 10 operators... Nothing was remotely believable especially for a movie which is supposed to be a real-life thriller. How difficult can it be? Zero Dark Thirty got it right 9 years ago and SEAL Team on CBS gets it mostly right every Wednesday on national TV.I was hoping for the movie to get better as it progress, but it actually got worse. The only positive point was Jamie Bell, which delivered a great performance as always. Here is a big tip for those looking for good action flick to watch - avoid this blah movie and go check Jamie Bell SAS movie's 6 Days.

I can look padt the obvious race of the main charscter, but somehow he turned white in earlier (later) storylines. The plot was brought up to date instead of Kelly being a Vietnam operator., ok, maybe I can look past that, but the antagonist was totally changed from street drug gang to Russian special forces.

"4571","I admit, I'm not much of a Tom Clancy reader. Sure, I've played his video games, and have even watched a few of the Jack Ryan films, but other than that, you couldn't get me to spew any trivia about him or his works if my life depended on it. So, as embarrassing as this is to admit, when I saw the promo for ""Without Remorse,"" I didn't even know it was based on a real book - I thought they were simply using Tom Clancy's name as a marketing ploy to get viewers. Regardless, this is all just a roundabout way to get you to realize that, when it comes to my review on this film, you can rest assured that I had no preconceived notions when sitting down to watch this, and nothing to base it off of; all I wanted was an entertaining action movie.""Without Remorse"" is not an entertaining action movie. I'd go as far to say that ""movie"" is even the wrong classification for this film - perhaps more accurately the FDA should state that this movie should be used in cases of extreme insomnia, because staying awake was the most thrilling part about watching this. ""Without Remorse"" stars Michael B. Jordan as John Kelly, a Navy SEAL whose wife gets assassinated, seemingly in an act of retaliation by terrorists. John Kelly goes John Wick, and blazes his way through friend and foe, all in an attempt to avenge his wife. It's a tried and true plot, one that we've seen before, but that shouldn't matter if the action was good; spoiler alert: it's not.This is the most bloodless, watered down, and sterilized R-rated action movie I've ever seen; I actually had to pause the movie toward the end and check just to make sure it wasn't PG-13. Alas, this is rated R, but you won't know it when you're watching. Besides a puddle here and there, every gunshot, knife wound, or punch is devoid of blood, which in turn makes the violence devoid of thematic impact. John Kelly stabs and shoots people point black, and not even a spatter of blood exits their body. Additionally, there is no nudity or f-bombs in this movie - combined with the utter lack of blood, I'm almost certain this was filmed to be PG-13, but for some reason the ratings board deemed it unsuitable for those under 17.Besides the lack of bloody violence, there is also a major lack of action, period. ""Without Remorse"" takes a painfully slow burn approach, and for the majority of the running time you'll be privy to horrendously dull conversations where wooden actors dump exposition to each other. The dialogue in this movie is nondialogue; the acting is nonacting; every line, every action, feels so inhuman, uncanny, and unnatural that you can practically see all of the boardroom executives who were no doubt playing god during production, all attempting to make the movie in their own vastly different image. So what are we, the viewers, left with? A scatterbrained mess where nothing and no one acts like it should.Complete with a bizarre third act decision that had me rooting against our hero, and even hoping for his demise, ""Without Remorse"" is one of rare times where I found myself actively bored with an action movie. It doesn't take much to please me, but with the sanitized action, cliched plot, and mediocre acting, ""Without Remorse"" didn't leave much to be entertained by.","3","darkreignn"," Sanitized, scatterbrained, and sleep-inducing

"4579","Michael B. Jordan gave an incredible performance, capturing the quiet determination and commitment of Tom Clancy's John Kelly. But the rest of this movie was a failure of imagination and a monument to formulaic cinema.The source novel takes place in the Vietnam War era, so it's understandable that they didn't want to make a straight translation of the book. But the storylines were still there for the taking - a Navy SEAL taking revenge on a drug trafficking network that caused his wife's death, while he's also doing covert operations for the CIA and DOD in a war zone? What part of that couldn't have been made relevant for today?An even bigger travesty is the character development of John Kelly in this movie. In the the novel, Kelly's handlers are continually surprised and impressed by his analysis of the economics of the drug trade and interpersonal dynamics of the drug cartel he's trying to take down. He's also adept with logistics and tactical strategy, even improving on their mission plans in Vietnam. These traits are what make him so valuable to the CIA, and eventually the obvious choice for heading up Rainbow. But in the movie, Kelly is reduced to a killing machine who shows flashes of intelligence, yet still manages to fall into just about every trap set for him. Too often, MBJ's Kelly has to fight his way out of a bad situation, whereas Clancy's Kelly was always one step ahead.The 4 stars here are for MBJ making the most of what he was given. Too bad the creative team didn't make the most of what they were given by Clancy and could've been given by MBJ.","4","jhornsby912"," Missed opportunity / Waste of MBJ

Absolutely nothing new or even exciting to see here; if you were hoping for a Tom Clancy thriller, cease to hope before watching.I am a huge fan of Taylor Sheriden who has written so many great things, and I am so glad I didn't realize he wrote this until after I had already seen it, otherwise my expectations would have been sky high. Never in my wildest imagination would I have guessed that he wrote this consider the entire time through the movie I kept thinking how god awful the writing and dialog was. The main character is constantly talking to the audience (through a side character) to make sure that we are ""caught up"" with what is going on, over and over again, but the dialog doesn't even hide it well.Overall, even writing aside, there just isn't a good movie here. It's very unfortunate what is happening, and i'm not even sure I know what, but I have no doubt this very low quality(plot wise, not production value)/low suspense movie will be ""#1 on amazon Prime!"" and tons of people will watch it and it will justify this horrible cycle of producing crap films with bad writing and poor plots.

So far, I think there's not one single Clancy ""based"" movie that deserves the signature.Without Remorse, IMHO, is the most engaging of Clancy's novels. It would make great material for a 10 episode series, and then a basis to keep on with the Ryan saga. Might make a terrific serialized program; one season per novel, demanding that the producers kept in the true narrative of the novels; so much material there.Returning to the film, it might entertain you; heavy action, completely unbelievable. Just don't expect Clancy.","2","I_should_be_reading_a_book"," Clancy must -should- be doing cartwheels in his coffin

"4630","Ugh, what a drag this one turned out to be! When you realize that Without Remorse is supposed to be the foundation for Rainbow Six (which went on to revolutionize first-person shooters), it comes off as an even weaker attempt. Taylor Sheridan collaborates with video game writer Will Staples on a script that's best described as a hotchpotch of action film clichÃ©s. Bad Russian sub-bosses, a broken ex-soldier, monologues on American patriotism, zero character development, big nonsensical conspiracy theories, and a twist that's as predictable as it can get - you name it - this flick's got it!I usually dig the grit in Sheridan's scripts. Wind River and the Denis Villeneuve-directed Sicario are personal favourites. Without Remorse, however, has none of it. Michael B Jordan is a fine actor, but the shoddy material that he's given to work with does him no good. The set-pieces fail to excite, even with stuff blowing up every third minute. The final nail in the coffin is the main antagonist's ""why"" exposition, and by the time we get to hear it, we've stopped caring about the film altogether.","3","arungeorge13"," This one bites the dust in no time!

He joins an elite team to go after Rykov in Moscow. While on this mission John learns that there is a covert plot to keep the United States and Russia constantly at war because war is profitable.

The acting is okay when it's allowed to show up between the shootings. I have never watched a movie where a woman was a Navy Seal as we see Jodie Turner-Smith plays a Navy Seal.Basically, this is a revenge movie. Michael B. Jordan is adequate in here. Oh, he is also a producer of this movie.Let's hope Tom Clancy's other stuff turns out better. In here we didn't care about any of the characters, and yes, there were too many shootings going on all the time. That little bit about the conspiracy was really the point of the movie.

This film 'subverts my expectations' by flipping that on its head which while inline with modern Hollywood doesn't make it a good decision.If you haven't read the book then this film is still bad, the movement and weapons choreography of what is supposed to be a highly trained group is rubbish by modern standards - notably towards the end where they make their way down the stairs.

Nearly all the other characters are cardboard cut outs and imminently forgettable.Several of the action sequences are shot in near darkness making it hard to see what is going on. This was further exacerbated by the fact I cared less and less as the film limped towards its staggeringly obvious conclusion.I spent the last 40 minutes looking at my phone, waiting for the bad guy to be ""revealed"" and then die.None of the action is remotely credible, hiding behind doorways to avoid a suicide vest, driving off a bridge into water without injury etc etc.I can only assume the military consultant was the bloke from the local air soft range and the medical advisor does first aid courses out of the local travel lodge. Both areas are woefully inaccurate in almost every detail.If you're looking for excitement, intrigue, suspense or fresh ideas, then you'll not find any of that here.From the ending, it appears that Amazon were planning this to be a franchise.

"4669","Michael B Jordan Was just angry right from the start. There was just no need for his hostility right from the beginning, this immediately took me out of the film. Straight up he was angry at the CIA guy, ok right we see there is some foreshadowing kinda setting up plot points etc but why? So he didn't tell him they were selling arms, they didn't tell them there were Russians there. Why would that matter, he wouldn't have carried out his mission differently, they still had a hostage to extract and they did it, that might seem petty but like I said straight up I was rolling my eyes, just lazy writing
It got worse from there, just ridiculous plot point and fortuitous things happen so the movie could happen, by the time he extracted a name from a dying Russian that was just so convenient I was pretty much laughing. So what's left, the plot sucks how about the action, it was ok but as I didn't care about any of the characters I didn't really care about what was happening, just extended very long shootouts, improbable action. The obligatory Very slim small no muscle woman beating a highly trained Russian spec ops guy in hand to hand. The completely useless Russian police who can only look up and miss a whole team walking out the front door right in front of them.. just pointless and boring.","3","philipj980"," Mediocre at best at worst well

"4672","They should really stop using Tom Clancy's name before it runs the brand. Action is serviceable, Michael B. Jordan isn't terrible but the movie is bland and boring despite the decent action.Thing is, most action is good nowadays, most have taken cues from John Wick and realized people like the steady cam continuous shots. However, that's just not good enough anymore.","4","halfxbreed23"," Mediocre

"4673","Hollywood rolling out yet another tired trope--someone goes after the loved one of a bad ass protagonist, said protagonist goes after bad guy. The government doesn't want to do anything about it, diplomacy/politics gets in the way, our good guy doesn't care. Then he discovers a stupid conspiracy. And it's got ""Tom Clancy"" label on it, so you can figure out the rest.Of course, they have to inject a little unnecessary social justice scene that has little to do with the storyline. But Hollywood must believe that black characters need this anger to motivate them into violence and going above the law. So racist.There's really not much here that one episode of SEAL Team doesn't routinely handle with better acting and writing. It's not unwatchable, if you need a B-caliber action movie fix. But there are so many others that are much better. But rest assured, it's set up now for a string of equally cliched sequels.","3","yooniverse"," Another unoriginal origin story

Clancy would have had a HALO from a flight leaving the UK on a commercial flight path...get my point?Production value pretty good, decent directing, most of the dialog not that good.

That combined with gross color grading thats either overly blue, or overly green and yellow that's only comparable to what Mexico looks like in Breaking Bad on steroids.Audio mixing also seemed to be a problem, some scenes you can hear a knife swinging around or money flipping through a counting machine more than you can hear a person talking.Vanquish is just horribly made.

She even brings Morgan Freeman down several pegs on the acting level. Not good to terrible would be the score I'd give both performances. I don't have a problem with Ruby Rose but she is NO WHERE near the level of acting needed to be much beyond supporting cast. And even then. She's just a CW TV level actress. Even her British accent was poorly executed.In the beginning, Freeman and Rose are best buds but (literally) in a split second they are now enemies or frenemies. I don't even think this movie will make it on the cheesy cable channels. I've NEVER given a 1 star to a movie as there's usually redeeming qualities of some kind found in it from acting to cinematography to directing to SOMETHING.

Although it became obvious that the people she was meeting had a vendetta against her.This is a low budget action movie. It looks cheap, the action scenes are awful and poorly staged.

Damon (Morgan Freeman) is a former hero cop and now a retired bad cop who is now wheelchair bound as he was shot during a last job doing a bad thing. Damon needs Vicky, his Caretaker, to do one last job for him and then he will release her daughter, Lily. She needs to make 5-stops to pick up money from a group of bad cops running drugs. Once done she will get her daughter back and be free.Morgan Freeman doesn't normally play a bad guy, but in here he kinda does. They did his makeup to have him look like a really bad evil guy. Hard to believe, I know, but there he is. See for yourself if you watch this.Here is what we see: Vicky makes the stops, shoots to kill when she needs to and we see her running away on a motorcycle as bad guys chase her in their cars. This is not as exciting as it sounds because we really don't see much in these very darkened scenes. She just stays ahead of them and turns left or right as Damon tells her as he can see what is in front of her due to a body-camera on her. Too many scenes with her on the motorcycle. Too many.We see the bad cops from time to time and they all agree to kill Vicky and Damon.This isn't very good and we wish Ruby Rose and Morgan Freeman would pick better stories. Here's the thing: the acting was suspect in many scenes, the dialogues were lame, we didn't care about any of the characters in here, good or bad ones, and in a way, it was quite boring. And not to be outdone: there was no suspense or tension in here. See? Hey, I did try to hold back some. Ha! (2/10)

"4735","IN A NUTSHELL:
A mother tries to put her dark past as a Russian drug courier behind her, but a retired and crooked cop forces her to do his bidding by holding her sick daughter hostage. Director George Gallo has done some great movies in the past, such as Bad Boys, so this dud was kind of a surprise. In the film industry, it's called ""below-the-line work"" and is, surprisingly disappointing.THINGS I LIKED:
Who doesn't love Academy Award winner Morgan Freeman? Honestly, I was kind of surprised he took on a role in such a mediocre movie. Unfortunately, he utters lame lines from his wheelchair like, ""Get outta there"", ""Don't pass out!"", and ""Turn right."" He looks extremely bored during the entire movie. Weird, right? It reminded me of Bruce Willis, who has been seen in several movies recently that are just terrible. Are they both that hard up on cash these days?I've always liked Ruby Rose's chic, edgy, feminine look, so I wish she hadn't shaved off all of her hair. This is the first time I've really heard her Australian accent. She's not a great actress, but I still just like watching her. Her motorcycle is cool.I think the movie poster is pretty dang cool and intriguing. I like that the weapons form a V for ""Vanquish"", as well angel wings.Tension-building soundtrack.There are some artsy camera shots. (There are also some bad shots.)
Morgan Freeman's house in the movie is gorgeous.There's an unexpected twist.This is the third time Director George Gallo has worked with Morgan Freeman after 2019 THE POISON ROSE (not very good flick) with John Travolta, and THE COMEBACK TRAIL (silly & fun movie).THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
So many lines are repeated unnecessarily.Lots of blue and purple color grades. I think the director was trying to go for an artistic look, but it doesn't quite work.A lot of the dialogue is terrible.A lot of the acting is terrible. There are some especially bad southern accents.These are some of the worst shooting villains ever.Some bad plastic surgery.Some of the camera angles and editing are strange.There is no contrast between good and evil. Everyone has a dirty past...and present.I kept hearing ring tones, thinking my cell phone was going off.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Bloodied, dead bodies
Lots of violence with gore
Crude language, profanity, and F-bombs
A scene in a club with prostitutes
A glance at an inappropriate image on a TV

"4742","I'll be honest- I gave this movie a try because I heard this is the worst movie of 2021 and it did not disappoint in that department. I didn't think it an be that bad with an actor like Morgan Freeman in it and a decent budget, but it is!I was never a Morgan Freeman fan, for some reason his voice and acting style didn't resonate well with me at all, however this has nothing to do with Mr. Freeman. The main problem with this movie is the horrible editing, sound mixing and acting of all other actors. After you get passed that you can also see that the story is also weak and unbelievable, but again, it is a distant second to the atrocious movie making skills of whoever was involved in this dreck.Starting with a non-ending horribly edited beginning credits you are already starting questioning what you are going to see, and it is not getting any better. The general story is about an underground crime network that has corrupt cops supporting it (nothing new really). I lasted about 30 minutes in when I had to turn it off. I don't understand how somebody will finish watching this ""creation"" unless they are being paid to do so. It looks like a pitch filmed on a mobile-phone shown before the actual movie is made just to show the concept to investors. Since nobody compensate me for my time I decided it's enough for me to crown this as the ""worst movie of 2021"" (at least as of now) without needing to watch to thing to the end.Exact score: 22 / 100 due to it not being the worst movie ever, but really there is not much going for it. I would imagine you will watch it only if you lost a best of some sorts.","2","FixedYourEnding"," Is it really that bad? yes it is!

"4744","My girlfriend and I made it 40-minutes before we quit. It was edited poorly, acted poorly and written poorly. It's not as bad as Cosmic Sin (so it's not the worse movie of the year), but it's pretty bad.Ruby Rose just can't act, I don't get why Hollywood won't stop pushing her. Morgan Freeman obviously shot most of his scenes in one day (lol in one room).The editor was almost certainly on crack, the fades, the swipes and the cross fades were some of the most egregious editing choices I've ever seen.The opening scene that offers up some background info on one of the main characters last 6 minutes, it's interspersed with the opening credits and my god those six minutes are some of the longest six minutes you'll ever suffer! My guess is the film didn't meet the required 90-minute runtime, so they prolonged the opening credits in order to meet that requirement.The action (in the first 40 minutes) was lacklustre, the vibe and tone was off and the movie plays out like a glorified fetch quest.In short, DO NOT WATCH THIS.","1","Astropleb"," BAD MOVIE ALERT!

No one respects no one, shooting for no reason, no backstory for her brother no nothing.Rly, I rarely consider a movie a waste of time but this one really is!I couldn't finish it.

Horrible audio editing and choice of music, scene cuts were a disaster, and what is up with the green and blue hues?Whoever put this together should stick to B-movies....sorry some B-movies were shot better than this.In summary, what a disappointment. :(","1","junior-70571"," What a disaster
"
"4752","I read the reviews, and decided to watch this movie anyway. Well, first, i think that this movie looks and feels to be so low budget. I think it's a complete rewrite because of the story line. Explanation: there are huge story lines missing. Example: the explanation of the dead brother of Ruby Rose's character, the story behind Morgan Freeman's character, what Ruby Rose's character did with her brother to make her an enemy to all the crime bosses, what illness her daughter has, and how she met Morgan Freeman's character. The actors seem to have not been interested the entire movie, and I'm sure it may be because the script they signed contracts for was completely different and possibly better than the pandemic rewrite. It just seems like a forced movie. Its like you came into the movie theater in the middle of the movie. With that said, the videography is horrible, the locations are cheap, and you are left confused to why all of this even started or happened. I think the actors and actresses did their best with what was given, but the delivery of their lines makes you think that they didn't want to do the movie. Especially Morgan Freeman's character. The action scenes are just 30 different angles switched back and forth, the outdoor scenes are fake and cheap. The indooor shots seem as if they are sneaking and secretly trying to shoot a movie. Ruby Rose's shooting scenes are so fake, and the bike riding scenes are obviously green screen backgrounds for most of it. The bike chasing scenes aren't edited, so you can see that she isn't riding fast at all. The scenes where she gets shot at on her bike are not edited, so it looks as though they are purposely shooting at objects beside her. Her evasive riding is delayed, and makes the chase/shooting scene look even worse. Really, the entire movie seems unedited. It's horrible. I just had to see it for myself. Be aware though, there are B movies and then two letters below that is this movie.","3","grabboid-44815"," Eeeehhhh
"
"4753","Surprisingly poor acting by all players, including Morgan Freeman. Ruby Rose is so hard looking, it's difficult to watch. The severe haircut wouldn't even be attractive on a man. The movie wasn't much more than a bunch of loud racing motorcycle shots and close ups of Ruby Rose making flippant faces combined with intense ""knowing"" smiles by Morgan Freeman from a wheelchair. Not a believable plot. Avoid this one. A waste of Morgan Freeman's talent and my time.","2","carolsparks-43587"," Bad acting, boring

I was also a little intrigued to see what Ruby Rose was doing after Batwoman. It's obvious that the director had watched way too much John Woo. He's trying to do 90's Woo but lacks the skills. He even pulls a homage to doves. This movie really struggles right from the start with two confused boring scenes. It's trying to set up something but the movie really only needs to start with Freeman and Ruby Rose.

What is left is a jumbled mess of shots drenched in a hazy dream-like filter/editing style which leaves you dettached and bored.This movie is not worth your time, except as a case study of how not to do it.PS: It would be interesting though to see how other directors would have approached this idea.","3","black_dodo_b"," Didn't work as a movie, sadly.

"4781","So to start off ill be honest i never understood why Ruby Rose is always cast as a bad ass action hero chick, she is so small and i always have to highly suspend my disbelief to enjoy the movies. That said, some of the movies she was in were not bad actually. The Doorman was fairly enjoyable yet modest in budget and set up. Some could say it was a poor man Die Hard clone but whatever, i enjoy these type of flicks.So when i saw this new movie Vanquish and it had Morgan Freeman too, wich usually is not in utterly bad movies, i taught this should be entertaining. Whats ""direct to video"" in 2021? I mean with theatres having been closed on and off for the past year and tons of movies releasing directly on streaming services or VOD when they were supose to come in theatres it could be anything.Well turn out this is really a low budget DTV intended movie. Have you seen Acceleration with Dolph Lundgren? This is pretty much the exact same script with minor changes... At least Acceleration had a few hand to hand cool fights. This one does not have much, a few Bike chase sequences but i don't know if its me that can't follow the trend but an electric bike does not seem as cool as a classic one that run on fuel. The engine sound just bugged me in those sequences.The truth is the movie is not horrendous, its just not interesting. Not enough action or much to entertain you, not enough plot/backstory to make you care about the main character.I think the reviews giving it 1 are really going overboard on hating it tough, but its simply a below average movie that has nothing that make it go out of the lot. I wouldn't even recommand it for guys like me who enjoy low budget DTV movies. But at the same time i can't seem to find anything really ""that bad"" about it that would make me hate on it. Its just... there. If that make any sense.","4","destroyerwod"," Cheap DTV movie that is just not that interesting

Also the cinematography was let's just say early 90's low budget. The motorcycle scenes somehow involved her riding and flashing back to the scene she just had a few seconds ago. And for a guy who forces her to do the runs, Morgan has little control over her. He says just pick up the money but she causes all the violence on her own.

The action scenes are clipped and shaky, as well as the overall cinematography (if you can call it that) being almost non-existent.This is a top-shelf Razzie if ever I saw one.","1","netdcon"," An exceedingly poor attempt at making a Luc Besson girlie shooter.

"4801","This movie is actually quite intriguing for the first 40 minutes or so. The set design is excellent, and along with cold emotionless expressions on the actors and shots of the mundane lives of the would-be colonists, helps to establish a plausible set-up with tons of potential. They know they're the first generation of a ship on a multi-generational voyage to colonize another planet, and may also be humanity's last hope of survival. Their grim personas express their awareness of this fact and that the mission is paramount. There's even a mysterious hint at an unexpected presence on the ship to add to the suspense.Don't bother watching the second half though. As a lot of other reviews have mentioned, it tries to adapt a plot similar to Lord of the Flies, however the big difference here is that these teenagers are supposed to have been highly trained for this mission their entire lives, and are literally the future of humanity. They're not a ragtag group of students on a deserted island struggling for survival.I don't think I need to use any spoilers for you to imagine how trying to shoehorn the Lord of the Flies plot into this situation leads to a trainwreck of a last half. The script takes a sharp turn into utter nonsense with ridiculous dialogue and characters actions. It is truly such a pity and a waste of a great set-up.I will say that I was impressed with the performance of Tye Sheridan in particular, and Colin Farrell can rarely do wrong as well. The other main actors were decent at best, or just too weighed down by atrocious dialogue to make anything of their performances.I'd recommend watching the first 40min or so (8/10) and then just walking away and imagining your own conclusion. Anything would be better than what transpired in the last half of Voyagers.","4","kaideneve"," Frustrating nonsensical plot drags down everything

"4805","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)When people ask me my favorite genre, I usually reply with the admittedly annoying and cliche ""I enjoy every type of film"". While this is ultimately true, I do tend to love sci-fi and a couple of other genres more than the rest. I find sci-fi to be one of the most creative filmmaking sources, partially due to the infinite potential of its storytelling. From extraterrestrial life to an exploration of deep space, our world knows so little of what's beyond our planet, which makes the respective genre a perfect framework for imaginative, unique fiction. Voyagers features an interesting cast, but Neil Burger was behind the disappointingly hollow Divergent saga, so I couldn't help but go in with very low expectations.Even anticipating a tough watch, I never thought Voyagers would be a contender for one of the worst flicks of the year. The general premise is far from being groundbreaking, even with the not-that-original spin that it puts on the ""colonization of another planet"" concept. Still, it's considered a formula because it worked on several other occasions. It just doesn't in this movie. The group of young people bred separately from the outer world could have received an innovative, inventive arc but instead follows an incredibly generic, dull, lazy character development path. The chaos and mayhem triggered by a single person - who just so happens to embody literally everything that's wrong with our society - is as extremely forced as it is utterly ridiculous.In fact, it even raises logical questions regarding the premise of the film. Obviously, people can be born into the same place with the same education, morals, and everything that comes with growing up and still develop a distinct personality. However, Burger doesn't demonstrate why some characters end up challenging the authority and questioning their purpose. Everything happens because it needs to happen. A character performs an irrational action because the plot demands it. Most of the story development is given through absurdly childish dialogues, where a character repeatedly asks ""why?"" to someone with some sort of an answer.Burger's screenplay barely survives due to the lack of any exciting characteristic. From an obviously misleading subplot to the frustratingly predictable main narrative, this movie carries zero surprises. The horrendously choppy, abrupt editing work (Naomi Geraghty) turns an already complicated watch into something borderline irritating. Add weirdly creepy, nonsensical imagery of random life events on completely arbitrary points of the runtime, and Voyagers becomes a really hard film to genuinely enjoy. With no flow between scenes, the primary mission is lost in the first minutes, and the characters fail to complete any resemblance of an arc.Actually, it's ironically funny how Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran Stark in Game of Thrones) continues the trend of not doing anything relevant in a movie or TV series. Unfortunately, not even the cast saves this disaster. Tye Sheridan (Dark Phoenix), Lily-Rose Depp (Crisis), and Fionn Whitehead (Dunkirk) try their hardest with the poor scripts, but some line deliveries are truly cringe-worthy. Colin Farrell's (The Gentlemen) character suffers from one of Burger's numerous bad decisions, ending up as yet another forgettable component of the film. The ending arrives way too fast, something that attests to the way too fast pacing.In these cases where I struggle to find positives in the two pillars of any movie - story and characters - I turn to the technical elements to help me out. Sadly, Voyagers is one of the rare one-location films that doesn't feel suspenseful or claustrophobic, despite many efforts. From the surprisingly ordinary score (Trevor Gureckis) to the by-the-numbers camera work (Enrique Chediak), there's not a single aspect I can take with me as an ""at least that was great"" thought. I guess the set design looks futuristic enough for a spaceship, but once again, it's nothing viewers haven't seen before.Voyagers holds a well-known, successful sci-fi formula and takes it through the most uninteresting, unsurprising, frustratingly generic development path. Neil Burger's screenplay fails to deliver a creative, captivating story with compelling characters, offering the complete opposite. From the terrible editing work to the extremely lazy plot development, passing through cringe-worthy dialogues and randomly weird, irrelevant imagery, it's tough to find a positive aspect in such a hollow movie. Even though most of the runtime is spent in a single location, the suspense levels are close to zero. The themes of the story are clear from the get-go, but the execution of almost every plot point or character action feels incredibly forced. The set design is the only technical component worthy of some appreciation. Not even a talented cast can overcome the awful scripts. A contender for one of the worst films of the year.Rating: D-","2","msbreviews"," Voyagers holds a well-known, successful sci-fi formula and takes it through the most uninteresting, unsurprising, frustratingly generic development path.

"4806","A good concept to work with but could have been so much more.

"4808","In 2063 it was decided Earth was becoming uninhabitable so an explorer mission to find another world was our only hope. Note: We now have the science for interstellar travel, but can't save our own world or green Mars. Children were raised in isolation for the trip so they would not know what they are missing. Colin Farrell travels with the teens to be the adult in the room. They discovered they were given a drug called ""blue"" which made them docile, i.e. Prevented teens from acting like teens. So they stopped taking the drug and the film turns into ""Lord of the Flies"" in space. Christopher (Tye Sheridan) is Ralph. Zac (Fionn Whitehead ) is Jack. Colin Farrell is like ""Piggy"" as the intellect who marks the ""end of innocence."" The"" alien"" is the beast. Been there, done that.

"
"4810","This went off the rails pretty quickly. Definitely written as if someone with no knowledge of any sciences outside of what they see on TV was trying to plan an essential mission to another planet - so, it's a mess. A lot of it doesn't make sense, but I get told to just pretend it away, so I tried that...And it's still a nonsensical mess made up of a bunch of (apparently) the world's most sociopathic teenagers, most of whom have no sense of self-preservation whatsoever, and a couple of Spock types who sort-of-kind-of try a little bit. But they still act like they didn't spend their entire existence training for EXACTLY THIS.None of these kids has any desire to live past tomorrow? You're going to try to convince me that the majority of humans' honest natures are irreparably evil and excited to die (because we don't come pre-programmed with the innate desire to procreate and continue surviving in their reality)? Even the imagery used as now-adult kids are experiencing emotions for the first time feels hollow, like a failed attempt at mimicry. A bad impression of emotion and sensation. Someone making this movie had a deep misconception of sociology and psychology, along with physics and astronomy.I can ignore some annoying science misconceptions, but the idea that the majority of humans are, in their truest selves, absolutely selfish, self-centered, ignorant, lust-driven, murderous, and purely evil gets ridiculously extreme. I could get behind a little stupidity, but this much of it is just chaotic to the point that it's boring. Like watching a room full of nap-less toddlers play Space Force.Just be ready for everything to go downhill as soon as Colin Farrell's character is gone. Somehow the person who spends the smallest portion of their life on this mission is the one with the most character development. His character is the only one that's easy to identify with, although Lily Rose Depp is a slightly robotic close second. At least that's who her character is supposed to be.Fionn Whitehead isn't very exciting in his antagonist role. He feels like a 13-year-old trying to play sociopath, like he may not have studied this role and instead chose just to do Manson-eyes at the camera really badly. He's a terrible villain.All in all, the only person associated with this movie that I could believe is a sociopath is the writer. And maybe whoever else is in charge that made the decision that this would either make sense or be a good movie.","3","amycarender"," Boring, disconnected, and irrational.

The pacing was very slow, and to make matters worse, there wasn't enough substance in the story to fill 108 minutes.

"4813","I can sum this up quite tidily, as the premise of isolation in space while trying to explore for habitable worlds is nothing new and found this one to plod along quite predictably.If I might suggest a film that is much more well made and palatable; Clair Denis' ""High Life"" from 2018.

"4814","The movie or story has quite a few themes that are interesting and could be described as deep.

It sort of panders to the teenage audience it aims at.Now I don't think it is bad overall - but I can see that some people felt offended (intellectually and otherwise) by the movie not taking the viewer seriously. It just isn't the philosophical movie you may expect it or want it to be. Still there are (predictable but still) enough twists and turns and tension to keep you on your toes .. of sorts.

"4818","3.5 out of 5 stars.Voyagers is a pretty fair science fiction film about a biologically created group of kids. Who are going on a voyage to a new planet to colonize and start over. But while on a space voyage. They discover there pleasure senses have been reduced from a drug they been taking. They decide to stop which there wild instincts kick in into madness. Which the group of teens will be divided from trying to have a civilized rule to a living life wild which can put the future of humanity at risk.What worked? The concept and plot is promising. In a future. Earth is no longer livable. Researchers decides to genetically create humans so they wont be attached from leaving earth. They have been isolated from civilization. And Richard (Colin Farrell) who is a researcher and a mentor. Tags along with the space crew to make sure they are behaving. Until they start to lose control.The set designs and visual effects are great. Kind of feels similiar to the movie Passengers.The cast ensemble is good. Colin Farrell is good. Tye Sheridan and Lily-Rose Depp were great. Fionn Whitehead playing a rebellious teen who is trying to create fear within the group and trying to live there lives selfishly was good too.What did not work? The film is a slow burn thriller. The second act is slow and boring in the middle. Could have been a faster direction. The film does pick up when tension rises with Tye Sheridan and Fionn Whitehead are divided and fighting each other.Also the music score was a bit dull for a science fiction space thriller. Which kind of made the movie feel a little dull.It does have an interesting premise and some thrills and a great cast. Which could have been better.","7","cruise01"," Sci fi premise that focuses on human wild nature but stylistic film.

"4841","I like the idea, a lot... but the way the story was presented was just so typical - Even the climactic battle, TYPICAL. Also, excuse me but, Bandersnatch was hanging out of the hatch for 10 minutes with no mask/helmet on, and Johnny Depp's daughter had the integrity of her space suit punctured during the melee and let's not forget that the whole way down chasing after Tye and Lily, Bandersnatch was shooting all of the doors, so when the hatch opened - wouldn't everything be wrecked (oxygen levels and whatnot, no sealed door to protect the rest of the misfit crew??) - I get that you're supposed to suspend belief and all, but I can only do that if the story is worthy, and this, was not.Also, Colin Farrell's noble purpose of getting on that ship to protect the children, and then proceeds to spends years showing them and telling them about love and loss and life on Earth and all that - He ruined the mission. He ruined the entire mission.They should all be dead. The mission was a bust.(I get it though... human nature and all that, I just didn't like how all the pieces were put together.)With all my ranting aside, I really, liked the idea of this movie, The Blue and how it's so messed up, but kind of has to be... Although, one would think that if you put a full, and well-qualified adult crew along side the children that are supposed to take over, that they would've had a more fulfilled life on the ship and understood their roles a little more, and, you know, probably not've run riot.Good idea, meh movie.

"4844","I first found out about Voyagers after Lily-Rose posted something on Instagram promoting it. I thought it looked interesting, and had a cool trailer. Not to mention a topic that had lots of potential. I rented it today, not really expecting anything because of all of the bad reviews I had seen about it before. I went in thinking the acting would be bad, the writing would be mediocre, and it would just be an okay movie. After watching it, I can tell you that it wasn't that bad. The acting was actually fine considering that all of the kids are supposed to have no personalities. The writing is where my issue is. This is a great concept for a movie, but it was executed poorly. Richard was killed off much too early, and I feel like he wasn't very necessary to the plot. All of the characters made stupid decisions from there on out. I think the probably with the movie is the character of Zac. He became a creep almost immediately after stopping The Blue. He resorted to inappropriately touching the women in the ship without consent. I know that they've never known anything like this before, but all of these kids are supposed to be extremely intelligent. I feel like they might know right from wrong. Also, I find it hard to believe that once everyone was off the drug, that they all either turned to partying, or fighting. I think that's a stupid stereotype put onto teenagers in pop culture. I also think it's weird that everyone on the ship would mindlessly follow Zac down his hole of madness, and his random killing spree where he restored to shooting everyone who didn't agree with him. Overall, this movie is fine. I think I would recommend it, but it's not my favorite.","4","taylorhayzlett"," It was okay

"4849","Let's pretend we know nothing about human behavior, so we hand over the fate of mankind to a handful of in-vitro babies. Zero nurture is surely the way to go. What could possibly go wrong?The great difficulty in reviewing this movie is trying to pinpoint what is worse: is it the total disregard for the history of behavioral sciences? Is it the total disregard for the most basic facts about technology (like the ""bypass the firewall"" routine on a effing spaceship, or the single point of failure of having a single ""systems room"" in the spaceship that is supposed to be the last hope of humankind)? Is it the total disregard for physics (the final plot-twisting scene involving an airlock goes against almost everything we know about physics and human homeostasis, but what the hell...)? Or is it the fact that this is just an excuse to make an outer-space version (correction: bad version) of the Lord of the Flies?This deserves zero stars.

"4855","IN A NUTSHELL:
Hormonal teenagers running a spaceship...what could possibly go wrong? This teen thriller feels like a futuristic space version of William Golden's Lord of the Flies. So, is that a good thing or a bad thing? Lionsgate presents this new space drama written and directed by Neil Burger. He stated, ""It's about human nature in a vacuum - who we are at our core.""I really loved Neil Burger's film Limitless and highly recommend it. The TV series off-shoot was also very good. They both take a look at how drugs affect the human psyche and how we see the world. I also thought his Divergent franchise was entertaining, so I was excited to see what he was going to do with this movie.THINGS I LIKED:
Tye Sheridan leads the pack of hormonal teens in space. I really liked him in Ready Player One and he has even been in the recent X-Men: Apocalypse movies. He started his acting career at a very young age with roles in movies like Mud and Joe. He always plays a likable guy, so I immediately liked his character.Fans of Johnny Depp will get a kick out of seeing his daughter, Lily-Rose Depp as the leading lady in the movie. Her mom is the famous French singer, Vanessa Paradis. You can also see her in her most recent movie ""Crisis"" and see my movie review of that film here.Colin Farrell always makes a film better. Sadly, he's underutilized in this movie.Another leading character is played by Fionn Whitehead from Dunkirk (great movie!)
While most of the movie is pretty dark, the ending sequence was very hopeful. As viewers, we know the story isn't over, so it's fun to imagine these characters' grandchildren completing this mission.I really liked the concept of sacrifice for the greater good and how these characters would never actually land on the destination. Instead, their grandchildren would be the ones to reach the goal.Many of the scenes feel claustrophobic, which causes us to imagine what it would be like to live in such an environment. The set designs are clean and sleek.The music is really great.Impressive cinematography, especially considering the very tight spaces.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
You need to suspend your disbelief to initially accept the questionable premise of raising children in a sterile, almost non-human environment...as if that's ever going to be a good idea. It certainly makes a case for the importance of being nurtured, rather than engineered. Children need to learn how to deal with their emotions.There's a scene where the music starts to build and then, all of a sudden, the music stops and the screen reads ""Ten years later."" There are several abrupt transitions like that.Some things don't make sense. For example, the kids aren't supposed to have emotions, but one of them starts to cry and another one says he's afraid long before they stop drinking the substance that prevents their emotions.This actually could have been an interesting mini-series on TV so that there would be enough time to really get to know the characters and care about them. As it is, most of the teenagers are annoying. Some of the secondary characters aren't very compelling at all.The awkward dialogue makes it difficult for the actors to really dig in.It wastes the potential of taking a more profound look at human nature. Acts 1 and 2 start to dive into nuanced concepts, but Act 3 turns into a more young-adult thriller that only addresses the underlying issues on a surface level.There really isn't any humor and most of the characters are robotic during the entire film.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

"4865","Just some quick background for you all, in that I usually try not to beat up on movies despite the fact they may not meet my expectations (as that would entail probably sitting here on this site 24/7 writing about the myriad of dozens up on dozens of disappointing efforts over the years)I'm a HUGE sci-fi fan and of course also love other genres as well, just to give you some background.To that end, I recently checked this film out, as it seemed like an interesting premise. And frankly, it was. The first half of the movie was well done and fairly realistic. Unfortunately (and here is where we have a bit of a spoiler alert), once the antagonist (and his soon to be brain-dead sheep followers) was fully infused with hyper-testosterone by not taking the specific protocol of medication required for all of the crew members, the film went straight into the garbage bin for me.I mean, did the director really think that teenagers are so completely stupid that they would believe an 'alien' was involved in the death of the adult/supervising character (Colin Farrell) especially after they saw for themselves the actual video of him (the aforementioned antagonist) showing that he was the one who in fact killed the Farrell character?I just shook my head as things continued to spiral out of control into complete nonsense (and no, as some have alluded to, this was NO Lord of the Flies meets Space - Lord of the Flies was an excellent character study and a fine novel but this film was a pathetic and disgraceful attempt to try and seemingly mimic some of the dynamics of said novel and it failed miserably to do so)It's really too bad, as I indicated, the premise was interesting and the first half was quite good. Yet the last part of the film was a hot-mess of teen-angst meets out of control hormone self-indulgence.All I have to say is, STAY AWAY from this piece of ludicrous garbage and check out so many other very fine sci-fi/space flicks that are out there - contact me if you would like a list.Cheers.","3","sinischism"," Two words - DUMB & INSULTING

"4883","Such a sad state for us cinema-lovers. But I'll take what I can get, I guess. This movie borrows so heavily from Lord of the Flies that it might consider being renamed Co-ed Lord of the Flies in Space. There was one injured adult and when he was dead the smoldering silent and sensitive protagonist continued to try and maintain order until the power hungry jerk took the conch shell from him. And the young lady who represented the role formerly known as Piggy met a similar demise when she kept nagging everyone to stop misbehaving. Highly unoriginal. I guess there really are only about 6 or 7 story lines in cinema that just keep recycling over and over... Otherwise, from the beginning the Voyagers story is too big and ambitious and, thus, cannot make sense of all the questions that a story like this arises. Like who the hell would ever consider sending kids into space without a team of adult mentors to guide them? And not just one lonely Colin Farrell. Who still looks HOT as heck, btw. And why do they keep saying the first generation won't live to see the new planet when the trip is only 80 years and the kids are only 8 years old when they start out? And why is Brann Stark reprising his role as the 3-eyed Raven in this movie?

If you like that kind of movie, MAYBE (big maybe) this is for you, but it really doesn't even deliver that well. There are much better films that play with these themes than Voyager.Frankly, it was pretty lite on everything. Beyond the initial premise of what might happen on a long-term colonization spaceflight to an exoplanet, this film really didn't offer much. It wasn't particularly thought-provoking, fun, action-packed, suspenseful, dramatic, nor did it play with any new ideas. It was completely formulaic and predictable.While not hard science fiction, the movie Passengers was a more entertaining and better-looking interstellar trip than Voyagers.

"4899","As ""Voyagers"" (2021 release; 108 min.) opens, we are informed that in 2063 a new planet is discovered that will allow the human race to survive, but it will take 86 years to get there. A crew 0f 30 young people is being prepped in isolation for the journey. Then out of the blue Richard, the mission's leader, announces he wants to go along as well, even though it is an one-way ticket and means certain death. The mission takes off in 2067, and then we go to ""Ten Years Later""... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this s the latest film from writer-director Neil Burger, who is quite familiar with the sci-fi genre from his 2014 film ""Divergent"". Here he brings a new variation on a familiar theme: how the human race looks to the skies for survival on another faraway earth-like planet. In and of itself an intriguing premise (and hence one that is revisited regularly by Hollywood). The new element is that the crew of 30 will never reach the end and hence it will be their children and grandchildren who will benefit from all this. So far so good. Sadly, the movie makes a 90 degree (or frankly even 180 degree) diversion into ""Lord of the Flies In Space"" that is frankly pointless and plain dumb, and from which the movie never recovers. Colin Farrell (as Richard) appears for about the initial 45 min. In the film (in the all too obvious ""we need a star attached top this project"" tole. The rest of the cast are mostly non-names, the best of which is Lily-Rose Depp (yes, Johnny's daughter) who bears a striking resemblance to her mother (Vanessa Paradis). The movie's electronic core (by a certain Trevor Gureckis) is a blatant rip-off from Hana Zimmer's electronic scores like ""Blade Runner 2049"". The movie's production set is stylish and looks quite nice, keeping in mind the movie's relative low production budget (about $30 million). But none of these issues can mask the fact that the movie's strong start fizzles out completely and never recovers.""Voyagers"" was supposed to open in theaters last Fall but a little thing called COVID-19 had other plans. It finally opened this weekend. The Friday early evening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati turned out to be a private screening: I was the only person in the theater. The rest of the 16 screen movieplex was an absolute ghost town, just eerie. Meanwhile, whether you are a fan of sci-fi movies or simply a fan of Colin Farrell and you keep your expectations low, I'd suggest you check this out, be it in the theaters, on VOD< or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","5","paul-allaer"," Intriguing premise/strong start, but then fizzles out into ""Lords of the Flies In Space""

"4900","The future is here. Earth has a significant problem as it continues to heat up more and more, making it an unliveable planet. The only way the people of Earth can get by is to investigate and find a new home.Thirty young men and women are selected for a critical mission. The selection includes some of the finest young people of Earth who are well educated and healthy. Leading the mission is Richard (Colin Farrell), who is quite passionate to support the crew as much as possible. To the young people, he is a teacher, counsellor, and a general close friend. The mission will take over eighty years, which means the young people selected will never get to see their new home, but their purpose is to create new life once they are the appropriate age, and then the next generation will save the entire world.The mission is in progress, but Christopher (Tye Sheridan) & Zac (Fionn Whitehead) begin to question a few elements on the ship. They examine a blue liquid that they must drink daily and wonder why certain areas on the ship are hidden. What starts as a minor act of rebellion becomes a path of madness and paranoia, not just for Christopher and Zac but for the entire onboard crew. They also begin to question each other on topics such as leadership, affections and trust. To make matters worse, the team are also on edge as they learn there could be the threat of an alien creature on the ship. Can the mission be completed to save Earth? Will members of the ship survive the chaos?Visually, I found Voyagers to be rather pleasing. The world of outer space and future technology concepts on the ship were rather creative and great to see, and elements such as the sound effects were also outstanding. As a plot, Voyagers has a slow start. Once we see the ship members begin to raise questions and take risks, I was generally curious to know what will happen next. I was also questioning if the ship did really have an alien creature on board.But sadly, Voyagers is not a simple watch. While Voyagers delivers a pleasing world of space and sci-fi, the film's plot is quite messy. We witness characters doing repeated things: questioning the truth, arguing over leadership, exhibiting trust issues, and seeing teenagers discover their emotions and sexual feelings for the first time. While such discovery seems like an interesting concept for the first time, the film reveals these aspects in a repetitive, confusing manner. It is also frustrating watching these so-called intelligent youth make continually unwise choices.The film is also entirely predictable, contains cheesy performances, and there are some moments that I generally found awkward to watch. Watching a teenager touch a young girl without her permission for the first time with no real consequences, even from an adult figure, was extremely disappointing to see. Make note; this is not the type of film to share on a first date.The editing here is also questionable. There are moments where characters discuss an issue or have conflict only to get distracted by another issue that is occurring elsewhere, and the dispute is suddenly ignored. The film does not flow well, and scenes feel disjointed, failing to bring continuous flow to the story. After the film, I questioned if many cuts and edits were made for the sake of the film's runtime. For the most part, performances were fine, but by the third act, characters become more laughable than serious as they deliver lines that are just unfitting, cheesy and over the top.Overall, while I enjoy the concept of a group of youth travelling to a new planet to save the world and visually Voyagers has a few genuinely pleasing aspects as a sci-fi movie, it is messy and awkward. The editing is questionable, making scenes feel more disjointed rather than seamless. The film is also incredibly predictable regarding its mysteries. The plot elements feel repetitive as we watch the ship's crew bicker and argue over the same topic repeatedly to the point the film becomes laughable instead of something more exciting and memorable. Voyagers felt as though it was aimed at a more teenage audience.4.7/10 - Walkden Entertainment.","5","WalkdenEntertainment"," Earth Has A Big Problem...

"4901","I saw ""Voyagers"", starring Tye Sheridan-the X_Men movies, Ready Player One; Lily_Rose Depp-The King, The Dancer, Oh yeah, she is Johnny's daughter; Fionn Whitehead-Don't Tell a Soul, Dunkirk and Colin Farrell-Ava, Horrible Bosses.This is a study of what happens when your emotions are kept under control for too long-or let loose, all of a sudden. Colin leads a group of about 30 young people-about 10 years old-on a space mission to colonize a new planet. It takes 86 years to get there so Colin is just suppose to keep an eye on the kids as they grow up and mold them into a well oiled group of explorers. Since the kids will probably have died before they reach the planet-their grandkids will be doing the colonization-they are drugged with their food into having no emotions. No emotions, no problems, at least that is what was decided before lift off by the adults in charge. Tye & Fionn discover the deception and soon, there is a mutiny and 2 groups are formed, with Tye & Fionn leading the 2 different groups-each group has a different opinion on how things should be done on the ship. Pretty soon, you have a 'Lord of the Flies' type situation with complete anarchy. Lily plays the medical student on board that is also sought after by Tye & Fionn when their control is less than what it should be.It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, bloody images, language and sexual content-including sexual assault but no nudity-and a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.","6","stevendbeard"," 'Lord of the Rings' Type Situation

"4902","Depicting a space odyssey in just over an hour is going to be a challenge; not everyone can amass a budget like Stanley Kubrick, so I temper my expectations before blast off. I was impressed positively with all things physical - solid believable sets and costumes, and with crisp graphics provide an effective space vehicle. I cannot say I've ever imagined what a trip to our new planet will be like, or who will go - with a phenomenal videographic sequence depicting 9 months in seconds, then we know: those that know nothing of life on this planet. That was an unexpected premise; but what happens next as they develop? The writers decided to cart way back on the trip and offer a shallower, wide angle study of the group dynamic versus detailed character studies or engineering functions. Human nature cannot be deterred it posits wisely; the id and ego emerge, hormones flow, and so that goes. To generate conflict, superstition is introduced as a boogie man and bad things happen; corny as it usually is, many believe. There are a few thrilling sequences, predictable but with a payoff. Scripting had to meet the writers demands it seems, and is mostly sparse and punctual. Performances by the leads I felt are more than adequate as they did their jobs. The film is like a detailed Da Vinci painting, though not as valuable - we can zoom in on details in various areas of the story but when we stand back and take in the whole, the details fade and we appreciate the larger, more important story. It turns out we will keep on punching each other in the nose on the way, but we'll get there.","6","tnovak-86787"," A quickly moving experience

"4903","Most reviews here are tragic, saying this isn't what would happen, and the best of humans would know better than this going out in space. Well, if that movie was made, of a crew that was sent out on a 86 year trip and everything was fine and dandy, what kind of entertainment would that be? Instead, this movie is smart about showing the very core of human nature as it's being introduced in the later development of the young adult mind. Do people reviewing this movie have any clue or evidence of this experiment on humans? No one has, because it's a SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE idea.Even though every part of this movie is a cliche, it still delivers the message of our faults. How just one bad seed can spread fear and devastation, how peer pressure works, common enemy strategy and all other aspects of how every dictator has used their manipulation to drive their hate through people. If this isn't a perfect example of entertainment AND education, then what is?The cast is amazing and deliver such a performance of how it feels to go through existential crisis and experience revelations of a wider knowledge than the small world they've grown to know. Acting is in the eyes, not in the words.Anyone who says this movie is dumb or unrealistic, do so because they didn't understand it. It's like when someone says they understand how a car works because they can check the oil level themselves, then when asked to explain how the engine works, they resort to name calling and how dumb it is to cover up they have no idea. Well the more you learn about a car engine, the more you realize how little you actually knew from the beginning.","9","godosenteksist"," Great depiction of the human species.

There's absolutely no telling how they might go Lord of the Flies crazy after quitting the controlling drugs and dealing with hormones and everything else for the first time ever, with almost NO ADULTS around to stabilize society. So how they act in the second half of the movie MIGHT be realistic, who can really say. What's completely bullcrap fake idiotic is that such a mission would occur in the first place. No government would send out a big batch of kids on a mission to save humanity. There would be loads of adults.

The movie is interesting to watch albeit it has its cheesy moments and is a complete rip-off of the classic Lord of the flies.First of all the acting is pretty good, it has some emotionless moments that could have used some beefing up however. It was all to drive the plot around the lord of the flies copying.Secondly, cinematographically speaking it delivers a nice claustrophobic feel similar to the film Alien, the music also reminds some of it. Especially during the credits.Lastly, I would like to point out its basically lord of the flies in space, the characters are even the same , they even have a dedicated Piggy character. But lo and behold the twist, it has an ending exactly like Alien, they blast the bad guy (who also could be the metaphorical Alien in the film) out of the spaceship.Apart from that it, can fill the void you might be having on a Sunday night.","5","MrSpark"," Lord of the flies meets Alien

"4919","Apart from its intriguing premise, the hopelessly predictable, live-action, sci-fi saga ""Voyagers"" (*1/2 OUT OF ****) has little else to distinguish it. First, climate change has ravaged the planet, and the Earth is deteriorating at an alarming rate. Man is running out of time as well as resources! Second, the nearest planet fit for human habitation requires an 86-year voyage! Incredibly, serious minds decide to launch children into space and educate them so they can maintain their spacecraft during this voyage of a lifetime. Later, when they have matured enough, they will reproduce and then train their offspring! Presumably, these first-generation space travelers will apprise the second generation, their sons and daughters, about the dire necessity for colonizing the new planet. Undoubtedly, teens will applaud the confidence mankind has entrusted them with for such a critical mission. Nevertheless, just as parents dread the thought of teens sneaking out for a spin in the family sedan, space agency administrators are just as paranoid about their decision to let everything ride on these teenagers. Ultimately, a space program veteran volunteers to chaperone the thirty young adults dispatched for the stars. Inevitably, you can imagine the deceptive measures which man has taken to keep those young minds focused on the mission. Not only does ""Voyagers"" writer & director Neil Burger know something about YA movies, but he also helmed ""Divergent"" (2014) and was executive producer on both sequels ""Insurgent"" (2015) and ""Allegiant"" (2016), a futuristic film franchise based on Veronica Roth's bestselling novels.""Voyagers"" is set in 2063. Since the trip is an estimated 86-year journey, scientists have assembled a crew from scratch. Thirty test-tube babies--the bioengineered seed of MIT scientists and Nobel laureates--have been incubated in a remote laboratory under close medical scrutiny. These infants are confined for the duration of their stay. They never see either the sun or the moon. They aren't taken for rides in strollers to experience the seasons. Psychologists fear any exposure to either the world or humanity could jeopardize the mission. Similarly, they are concerned about the mission commander, Richard (Colin Farrell of ""Miami Vice""), the accomplished scientist who mentored these gifted youngsters. He is as close as they will ever come to having a parent. He says he can wave goodbye to Earth with few regrets. Indeed, Richard realizes he is taking a one-way trip, but the prospect doesn't frighten him. Nevertheless, he finds himself at a disadvantage when his young cadets bug him with nuisance questions about the mission. When they turn twenty, they approach him with pesky inquiries that make Richard furrow his brow in dread. Literally, these cadets fit British philosopher John Locke's essay about humans at birth being blank slates called tabula rasa. They know nothing more than what their particular culture has programmed into them.Meantime, inquisitive Chris (Tye Sheridan of ""Ready Player One"") and his best buddy Zac (Fionn Whitehead of ""Dunkirk"") discover that their popular beverage, nicknamed ""The Blue,"" which everybody guzzles like tap water, is laced with mysterious chemicals. Indeed, Mission Control has them on a regimen of anti-depressants to minimize any personality disorders. Chris and Zac boycott 'the Blue,' and they experience a radical change. They compete with greater vigor when wrestling since they can muster more strength and tenacity. Eventually, the other cadets follow their example. Before long, Richard finds himself at odds with Chris over this thorny issue. When the ship's communications system breaks down, Richard orders Chris to assist him with a spacewalk to repair the damage. Initially, Zac was assigned to help him, but Richard punishes Zac for groping their medical officer, Sela (Lily-Rose Depp of ""Tusk""), without her consent. Afterward, Richard promises Chris to contact Mission Control about the chemicals in their water supply. Unfortunately, Richard dies from an apparent heart attack. Although the cadets elected Chris as their new leader, they shirk their duties. The friendly rivalry between Chris and Zac reaches a breaking point, and they become bitter enemies. Pandemonium ensues, and the crew turn against each other. Despite Chris's reminder that survival is their first priority, Zac foments an uprising, and his faction raids the weapons arsenal.Sadly, like a pupil plagiarizing a book report on English author William Golding's Nobel Prize-winning novel ""Lord of the Flies,"" Burger has simply swapped out the island setting of Golding's classic with a spaceship. Sadly, studio executives who never read Golding's book but were eager to corner the market signed onto Burger's premise. Presumably, Burger didn't cite Golding because ""Voyagers"" added women to the narrative and outer space served as the setting. Mind you, ""Voyagers"" does a competent job of setting up the situation and getting through the sticky preliminaries. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" production designer Scott Chambliss and Burger have created a sleek, sterile, state-of-the-art spacecraft, but neither the vessel's name nor numerical designation is ever revealed. White is the dominant color. Considering the width of its cramped corridors, the spacecraft seems rather claustrophobic. Lugging oversized space equipment along those passageways would pose a challenge. Two people cannot walk side by side without brushing shoulders. The cadets wind up pushing a plethora of buttons on sophisticated consoles and ogle monitors galore, so ""Voyagers"" never lets you forget it is tech savvy.""Voyagers"" might have fared better as a goofy sex comedy. Imagine something like ""Porky's"" (1981) mashed up with ""Spaceballs"" (1987)! Up to a point, ""Voyagers"" floats several provocative ideas. Alas, the filmmakers don't follow through with anything genuinely original. Not only can you guess the identity of their new leader after Richard's demise, but also the inevitable 'happily ever after' outcome occurs once Zac's rebellion is quashed. After order has been restored but before the end credits roll, you won't be surprised at who is elected to replace Chris. Comparably, ""Voyagers"" isn't as entertaining as either ""Passengers"" (2016) or ""Breach"" (2020), no great shakes themselves, when it comes to depicting mankind's efforts to migrate elsewhere in the universe.","2","zardoz-13"," Teens in Space!!!

"4922","A didacticism disguised as a young teen sci-fi joint. Operates in spurts and violent sparks, there a multiple sequences where we get lighting speed montages of images associated with lust and it triggered the exact feeling in my brain when I first felt that sensation. The young people are experiencing all these things for the first time, they were raised in a society where everything is insular and they were never taught basic human concepts. Once they do get a taste for it the reality of their species becomes apparent, multiple ideologies come head to head.Voyagers has a great concept and it goes through interesting paths throughout the film as it is a slow-burner film packed with thrilling sequences, themes of love, friendship, and betrayal. All of those themes are visually explored and it just makes everything very stylistic breathtaking within its own matter. The film itself is definitely unique, sincere, and entertaining whilst the production design is beautiful to look at. The character development featured in the film was just fascinating but the chemistry, not so much. Honestly, the directing could've been better within some scenes as the cast members' performances weren't outstanding.... Well, it kinda was occasionally but it wasn't the best if you get what I'm saying. Loved the aspect ratio change throughout the film as well.The film's score was just great as well, it definitely blends in well with the theme of the film. You usually don't get any films like this one. Imo, this film is underrated based on people's thoughts of the film so far. Don't watch the trailer because it's terrible and the film is completely different and you may like it but not everyone will.

"4925","The voyagers, a group of lab-grown teenagers raised on a spaceship en route to colonize and repopulate a distant exoplanet with habitable conditions soon takes a darker turn when a few overly hormonal teenagers let their hedonistic fantasies run wild. The themes on humanity at it's worst self is emphasized throughout the film but the execution is too clumsy for it to make much of an emotional impact. It just goes to show that we don't need alien intruders, crashing asteroids, or severe malfunctions in the spaceship to threaten the mission when the worst of human nature can cause a much bigger problem.We also witness the kindness of compassionate and sympathetic characters like Sela (Lily-Rose Depp) that balances out the movie's equilibrium to an extent.Think it has more to do with the outlook on humanity's worst self more than the spectacle of showing breathtaking views of space and distant exoplanets. Apart from Lily Rose Depp's character, everyone else turned out violent, rapey and (very cliched) toxic males fighting over who gets to claim the girl.

You have a character try to be alpha who promises protection and food when really its all for his own gain and the rest cave in to peer pressure like fools showing every negative trait we're capable of. That's my only gripe. Could have made it more interesting by having a psycho on board caused by the drug perhaps.Most of the reviews are about expecting something supernatural/aliens or a twist that its all a simulation and vote it low but in a real situation this is the most likely outcome as far as what could go bad bar some catastrophic ship failure/collision. On an important trip like this there would be numerous safeguards against going off protocol. They wouldnt be able to go off the blue first of all.

"4947","Voyagers (2021) is a movie recently released in theatres my Mrs. And I caught last week. The storyline focuses on an 86 year space voyage to a planet that supports life. A group of babies and a scientist are sent in a spacecraft where they will live virtually their entire life on the space ship, the babies never knowing Earth, their parents and taking medications that keeps their emotions and mental state stable. When the children discover this they stop taking the medications and all hell breaks loose on the ship. This science fiction movie is directed by Neil Burger (Divergent and The Illusionist) and stars Tye Sheridan (Mud), Lily-Rose Depp (Tusk), Fionn Whitehead (Dunkirk), Chante Adams (The Photograph) and Quintessa Swindell (Black Adam in 2022). This movie has a new age Lord of the Flies feel to it with a space twist. The characters, acting and storyline was fairly interesting and at times very intense. There were some frustrating sequences that had me grabbing my head and screaming ""why."" The ending was fulfilling and the movie is worth a watch. It won't be one of your favorite science fiction films but is a nice change of speed. I'd score this a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once.","6","kevin_robbins"," New age Lord of the Flies with a space twist

Just cheesey and gory and funny and campy and pure enjoyment.I've watched enough let's plays of Five Nights At Freddy's to have recognized the plot just from the description, so I was expecting Nic Cage to chew on the scenery of gore and jump scares. I would have been fine with something a little lame but with that certain Cage flair.Instead, I got something surprisingly good. The cinematography was balanced, with little bits of surreal and fun angles, but never so much to become distracting. Good color scheme and lighting, and the creature design really captured that slightly terrifying look of way-back-when Chuck E Cheese.I enjoyed how the script was full of tropes, but the actors carried it well, and everything came across well. Almost like everyone was having fun, wanted the audience to enjoy themselves, but they took it just serious enough to deliver good performances.The whole movie is right on that edge of camp and parody, without necessarily being played for laughs like a comedy. Something more like Evil Dead 2 or Kung Fury; love and enjoyment of the genres without mockery.That being said, this is NOT a horror or even really a thriller. It gets those labels because it needs some kind of genre, but it really fits in its own little niche, and it will NOT be for everyone. But as a popcorn/drinking-with-friends movie, it really hits the spot.And I cannot understate how much Nic Cage was absolutely himself, dialed to 11. Sold every scene, and stole most of them. All without a single line of dialogue. That really was the cherry on top, and I gave an extra star and a half for his performance.","9","ravencorinncarluk"," Nic Cage dialed to 11

"4953","Strange and crazy idea at the same time, coupled with a ""special performance"" by Cage. For the fans of Nick Cage this is a treat, he is giving the audience what it needs. If someone remembers the SNL skit ""why am i not in that moviee?"" then they know that Cage could not have said no to this one. The story is simple: he gets stuck somehow in a random town and agrees to work for a night in Willy's Wonderland. Shortly after he has to fight against an evil bunch of animatronics, while consuming energy drinks and being nick cage. I have to admit that the work on the animatronics was good, sound mixing was good and the fight scenes were ranging from funny to fun. Don't expect to be very (or at all) scared; maybe just creeped out by the animatronics. Obviously, don't take this film seriously. It's campy enough and does a weird tribute to this horror genre and to Nick Cage maybe... But it is definitely entertaining. 6 /10","6","ThomDerd"," A Nick Cage Film.

"4954","A completely off-the-wall B movie that seems to be a cross between CABIN IN THE WOODS and A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. With animatronics. Starring what used to be the top A-list actor on the planet. Who seems to have no actual dialog to deliver. And partly paid for by product placement for GM because all the vehicles in it are branded for the camera. There are a number of theories. My personal favorite is that this was actual footage shot by a reality crew following Nic Cage on a typical night out. In other words, this s**t happens to Nic on a regular basis. The other theory is that Nic got tired of being in everyone else's B movies, so he decided to make one of his own. Fun and holds the attention. Like a car accident where the victims get back into their cars and crash all over again. Could easily become a cult classic.","6","A_Different_Drummer"," And Now for Something Completely Different.

"4956","I enjoyed this movie. It was pretty contained and I think used it's script and budget really well together.This film does seem a lot cheaper than it actually is, I think most of the money was probably spent on Nicholas Cage. I do however think that they used it well and it didn't really need any more spending on it. I think where it shows it most is the other actors. Some feel like they may have actually just found them in the town they shot at. It doesn't detract from the film it just kind of sticks out a little bit.I think the story is pretty interesting too. It was a little bit different which I appreciated. I think the action was pretty engaging too. I will say at some points the film did sag a little bit and I was like this feels a lot longer than an hour and a half. But for the most part it clipped along.I do think the comedy let it down a little. Some of the jokes were just awful and not funny. You can tell it is meant to be a comedic beat but I honestly was like ""that was a joke?"".I thought the movie looked pretty good for the most part too.I would give it a watch.","6","Golden_Hope"," Cheap and Cheerful

"4957","I guess the 5.5/10 agreggate is a thing but comments from mostly youngsters love the movie and are already demanding a sequel.I knew Nic had adoring fans at one time, I read several comments from feminine monikers that maybe he still does.I watched it once I started it. I can't even explain it. Inane chaos maybe. But I do love it when a deal that is shook on is honored and finalized as agreed to the end.Maybe a couple modern spaghetti dramas and 70s/80s movies collided.Anyway, don't want to be masculine toxic, but a beautiful girl is always a treat for me, Emily Tosta I think from Mayans.Beautiful women can absolutely hang around the finish line and go home with the winner (Nic in this case) as far as I'm concerned.Shows Nic's range very well (I stole that from a comment, so don't blame me).They afforded the license to play Free Bird?

"4964","What happens when you drop a** kickin' Nicolas Cage in a Feebles/Killer Klowns universe ? Exactly what you'd expect. No words, no explanation to his character except punches, kicks and final blows, Cage is at his best doing exactly what you love to see him do. While he's known for award winning and AAA blockbuster performances, I always enjoy seeing him in projects no one but him would accept and pull to their best potential. In recent years, Mom and Dad, Mandy & Color out of space really gained points with his mere presence, and boy does he shine when he's having fun. On par with those, this is a refreshing flick and I'm really hoping we keep seeing more pop up from time to time.

"4979","If you're going into this knowing it's a B-grade film (Possibly C), purposely designed to be nothing more than a silly movie to pass your time, then you'll have an okay time.I look at it this way, when watching a film there are two ways to view it: 'Objectively' & 'Personal enjoyment.' When I rate movies I do so objectively, so objectively this movie is a 3 out of 10 film. However, personally I didn't mind the movie, so my own enjoyment was about 5 out of 10.My personal enjoyment level is based on the fact I knew what I was in for, had I just started watching this without knowing it was a B-grade affair I would've been thoroughly disappointed. However, because I knew what I was in for, I was able to turn my brain waaaaaay off and enjoy the ridiculousness on offer.The story line exists simply to make the events of the film happen, there's no depth to it and it basically doesn't matter. The bi-racial guy they hire to play the black guy is literally a caricature of what it means to be black. He says things like ""Dayuuum"" and ""ya'll's crazy"" and opts to leave his friends behind... Very poor representation of 'being black', but it's something I've noticed B-grade films do A LOT! Black people are nothing more than a caricature to ridicule in low grade films. It's a real shame, wish movies would stop doing this.The film clearly doesn't have the best budget, so the gore isn't even as much as you'd expect, the actions not shot particularly well, lots of cuts, and reactionary shots (like blood splattering on an attackers face) rather than shots of the actual impact, especially when it comes to the human victims. One human they kill isn't even shown dying on screen, another is killed so effortlessly you wonder if all the money dried up before they got to him.TLDR; If you want a crap film you can turn your brain off to and just watch the carnage unfold... have at it. If you're looking for substance and want plot, good characters, theme, attention to detail and competent story telling... look elsewhere, this is definitely not the one for you.","3","Astropleb"," This is a B-grade film.

"4981","With the crazy time the world has been in, sometimes we just need to watch a silly film and Willy's Wonderland fits that criteria and I watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a drifter tricked into becoming a janitor for a former funland where he has to fight for his life.Main Character
The great Nicolas Cage plays the lead role here and he just really fits this film and shows his charismatic demeanour. He is a character that doesn't say much and through just his actions and facial expressions you get all the information that you need from his character. I mean though I will argue that maybe we could have done with even more crazy Cage here and a bit more intrigue added, I just felt like there was a bit more that could have been done here with the character.Supporting Characters
I mean the rest of the cast isn't worth anything, there are a bunch of younger actors who are here for one clear reason. I'm not gonna say what that is but I am pretty sure everybody knows and they are all bad actors and were bad here. Emily Tosta and Beth Grant play the largest supporting roles but they offer nothing and really feels like they are here for exposition sequences that are really forced and feel out of place.Story
The idea of the story is fun, seeing Nicolas Cage go against these robots in this setting is good and there are some pretty glorious fights that range to the absurd. But this film gets a bit too bogged down on its plot, it is at its best when it is Cage versus the robots but it brings in these other characters with back stories and I just didn't care and it took away from the film.Script
The script is pretty awful, the dialogue is really bad when it happens, the writers bogged down the plot too much and tried to do too much, I mean they could have done it but at least try and do it better then long exposition sequences.Style
The film looks like it was made for about a £100 but I actually thought that was part of the charm. It looks unpolished and cheap but works and makes the action scenes feel more gritty. I mean these scenes are great and had me laughing throughout and that made me enjoy the film way more then I should have, also the film has a great runtime of only 90 mins.Overall
Overall, I would say this is a below average film and it is. But I can't deny that I had some fun with this film and if you aren't a film purist and want something to laugh with and turn your mind off then I would actually say this could be worth a watch.","4","alindsay-al"," A Below Average but pretty fun film

Its poorly written, very poorly directed, poorly scripted, poorly choreographed, and poorly shot.There is really not point going into details, but if you want to know how not to make a film, or if your a lecturer highlighting the poor use of resources for film making to your students, you could well use this as a great example.Cage has no lines in this film, and I mean NONE, and if you are going to make a film where the lead character has no lines, it had better be a fantastic screenplay, This most certainly isn't and the attempt at a quirky implementation falls completely flat.I'd say see it just for the experience, but even that would be a waste of time.","3","Jim_Screechy"," Utter Foolishness

It's a higher end B-Movie in the vein of 'good' B-Movies like Evil Dead 2 and is just a joy ride.
This isn't a masterpiece, but high marks for possibly creating a new kind of genre.
It has troupes galore, it keeps itself from becoming campy, is kinda hazy in the serious department but is saved by everyone giving an honest performance when opportunity for hammy it up was ripe.There's a little mix up in some of the artsy cinematography. From a B-movie it's the main thing that keeps it from reaching 'masterpiece' B-Movie territory. There's many other things to nitpick, and with some better acting here, better dialogue there, and a more cohesive alignment with various things....could have launched it to the stratosphere.Point being. This is great, for what it is. Overall, this is something. Refreshing and possibly new.Nic Cage has been kicking out tons of junk movies for years now.

"5006","Nicholas Cage is a mute who is 60 but pretending to be 30 with his died black goatee and (usual) bad wig. He gets locked in a ""Chuck E Cheese"" type building and ""fights' robot characters. It's so absurd and boring at the same time. He's cleaning the place, a character comes alive, he fights it, then goes back to cleaning like this is an every day occurrence. Repeat this over and over.Once the cliched group of high school kids arrived, I had to stop, it was unwatchable. It wasn't funny, it wasn't entertaining. It was beyond stupid.

They didn't build up any suspense for the animatronics, I don't think there was a single shot that they didn't look like dudes in costumes. I have no idea why Nicholas Cage had no reaction to what was going on. He didn't even flinch when he started getting attacked by fluffy robots, it was just a thing that was happening. For a movie with such a cool concept, there was zero style, zero flair, and the most mundane action scenes I've ever seen.","1","dridgett-452-699045"," Boring and bland

I wanted to see him getting crazy and showing emotions like the other 2 movies I mentioned, and instead we got a non-speaking dull and boring protagonist.Ok, at first it was charming to see him not utter a single word, but later in the moive I was shouting at the monitor: ""TALK DAMN IT""!. Very poor execution of a non-speaking protagonist!Also, I really hoped he had some background for example his wife and kid(s) were killed but he somehow survived and returned to avenge their deaths, or maybe he was a kid that witnessed some killings taking place and had so much trauma he couldn't speak after it - NOT! Not a single scene where ANY of his behavior is explained. The moments when he's so much sticking to his schedule and letting the kids die really angered me too. Again, NO EXPLANATION whatsoever about that too!All in all, a very, VERY big disappointment.","3","BeerLover_"," Nah

"5018","I'm not a fan of Five Nights at Freddy's, a video game this is clearly based off the idea of. But I assumed this would be very much like that.This movie is cheesy and cringe. Sometimes in good ways, sometimes in bad ways. You don't even need much of an IQ to watch this as there is zero deep thoughts in it. Despite being cheesy they try WAY to hard to add some lore to this movies story and to be honest, you don't really care because of how bad the movie is.If your looking for scares on levels of the FNAF game, you will be disappointed. There are scares but none really catch you by surprise or are all that surprising or shocking. If anything most of them are humorous with how silly they are. Again, the movie is meant to be cheesy but this is just cringe. If you are expecting any sort of closure or ending, don't expect anything.Cage doesn't talk in the movie, which is fine because he's crazy in this as he is in many of his movies and he is entertaining none the less. Perhaps its the only redeeming factor of this movie. I also gave it an extra star because the animatronics were actually pretty good at being creepy (until they spoke). Though it was painfully obvious when they used CGI in some spots and ruins the moment.","4","rchosen-193-5535"," Come for FNAF, stay for Cage, forgot it all after.

"5020","Altough the plot is simple and old, telling the story in a different structure could have helped a lot. Also by showing the plot instead of telling the plot there could have been more to figure out by the viewer. AND if the lead character should have showed surprise or fear about what was going on, this could have been a nice simple movie. But because all of the above is not there, the movie is dumb and there is no tension at all.

"5023","A man runs over a set of police spikes on a highway. Unable to pay for new tires, he is told he can work to pay for them. The job entails fixing up a former Chuck E. Cheese's-style restaurant called Willy's Wonderland. The animatronics start to come alive and attack the man (who is credited only as The Janitor) as the night continues. He is aided by a girl named Liv and her uninteresting friends (who are only there to serve as a body count later on), who want Willy's Wonderland destroyed. The teens were annoying AF and had some terrible acting/dialogue. Liv, ultimately, proves herself to be a pointless character that really adds nothing to the story except to explain the backstory of Willy's Wonderland.The Janitor never speaks and, for some reason, needs to consume a can of soda every hour and play pinball (and we're treated to witnessing this more times than needed). Because he never talks and doesn't have any backstory, we don't care about him. It also never feels like he's in any danger when the animatronics attack because he so easily dismantles them each time. There's nothing more boring than a protagonist who has no weakness. It also makes zero sense why all of the animatronics wouldn't gang up and kill him at once.This wanted so badly to be a campy Five Nights At Freddy's movie but it just failed. The Banana Splits Movie did the ""murderous animatronic"" thing much better a few years ago. I actually cared about characters and there was a more entertaining story. Watch that instead.","4","haunt_freak"," Don't Believe the 10 Star Reviews

"5024","Nicolas Cage did it again, and by that I mean he accepted to play in a movie without paying too much attention to the script before agreeing to it. He's getting paid and that's apparently the only thing that matters to him. He isn't a bad actor, played in some really good movies, but the stinkers he played in are now taking the upper hand. In this one it must have been the easiest job ever for him as he doesn't speak a word, but it's not a good enough excuse for me to play in this movie. Willy's Wonderland is beyond dumb, and I'm normally easy going but this plot is just too dumb for words.

"5039","A driver (Nicolas Cage) suffers a flat tire on a remote road. He gets a tow into town where he is hired to be a janitor at a closed Willy's Wonderland. It's essentially a Chuck E. Cheese's with animatronic figures in individually themed rooms. The place is a mess and he's locked in overnight. Local girl Liv (Emily Tosta) tries to burn it down and gets arrested by Sheriff Lund (Beth Grant). Her friends help her escape and the group returns to burn down the place.I like the general premise and the place. I love Cage's obsessive cleaning although his character should start differently. Instead of a bad mother driving a muscle car, he should be a simple workman driving a beat-up truck. He should be poor which would explain him working as a janitor more easily. I like the teen group for the most part and they are good cannon fodder anyways. I like the animatronic killers although the killings get a bit repetitive. It's lots of fun the first time around but it gets a diminishing return with each kill. All in all, it's fun for awhile but the fun does diminish.","6","SnoopyStyle"," funhouse B-movie

"5044","OK, ""Willy's Wonderland"" isn't a great film. Not sure it's even a good one. But it is totally bonkers from beginning to end and is wildly entertaining. Nicolas Cage plays a man, just called ""The Janitor"" because he agrees to spend a night cleaning up ""Willy's Wonderland"", a run down version of ""Chuckie Cheese."" While he's in there, he gets attacked by one of the animatronic animals come to life. He summarily destroys it, puts on a clean ""Willy's Wonderland Staff"" t-shirt and gets back to cleaning. But it turns out that ""Willy's Wonderland"" has a dark and horrific past, it's no accident that he is in there, and that won't be the last monster he faces this night...This movie is insanely entertaining the entire length of its running time. It has a satanic backstory, annoying teenagers getting killed in messy and gory fashion, and Nicolas Cage going full-on ""Nicolas Cage"", leading to one of the characters saying what should become a classic line -- ""He's not locked in with them, they're locked in with him.""Totally recommended. Put your brain on hold for 90 minutes and have a great time.","8","stsinger"," Insanely Entertaining
"
"5045","Spoilers ahead, so don't read further if you want to avoid them.
Firstly, Nic Cage is pretty great in this film. I've missed him these past few years with very dialed down or tone deaf roles he's been given. He was free to basically have fun... AS LONG AS HE DIDN'T SPEAK. I'm not kidding, he has no lines in the entire movie. I imagine the film only had enough money in the budget to get him on set, and not enough to get him to speak. The plot is basically Five Nights at Freddy's but the walmart brand and intended to appeal to a much larger audience than 2010 zoomers. That said, the action sequences are fun, but don't carry the film far enough to be enjoyable. The characters are ignorant to an annoying point. The cops, and basically whole town are in on the scheme when they could just as easily nuke the building, or shoot up the animatronics. That'd be too easy. Instead, it takes 1 teenage girl with a pocket knife and 1 mute 60 year old to take on 8 or so 90's power rangers villain extras in a span of one night... or 90 minutes. It's super campy... almost as bad as The Dead Don't Die. Complete with a recalled joke of ""punch pop"" soda, mandatory break times, and a pinball machine mysteriously placed in the kitchen of the restaurant. I get it... once again, this is an ironic horror with a low low budget. Is it good? No. Is it awful? Yeah it kind of is to a degree, but you can likely sit through it and not be completely disappointed.","4","ryan-44110"," Doesn't deserve a 1 but doesn't deserve a 10 either. Let's be real here.

"5047","Well, I will say that ""Willy's Wonderland"" was exactly as I had expected it to be, for better or worse.I mean, a movie that is loosely based on the laughable Five Nights At Freddy's games is not exactly bound to prove to be stellar entertainment. And then you throw in a non-speaking, energy drink guzzling Nicolas Cage, and it is the recipe for a success movie, right? Well, hardly so.Sure, I mean, if you are like 10 years old and enjoy the Five Nights At Freddy's games then you will get some enjoyment out of this 2021 movie titled ""Willy's Wonderland"". But if you sit down to watch the movie with the purpose of watching a wholeheartedly entertaining and enjoyable movie, then you will be sorely disappointed.But it should be said that ""Willy's Wonderland"" was watchable enough for the pointless and mindless movie it turned out to be. It can be watched a single time, and never visited again, because the movie just doesn't have contents for a second viewing, no matter how you turn and try to look at it.It was the mindless violence and the caricatured animatronics that made the movie bearable to watch. But if you are looking for a well-written and properly thought-through storyline, then ""Willy's Wonderland"" is not the movie you should be sitting down to watch.The characters in the movie were just ludicrous. Especially the young adults, wow. Talk about a bunch of brainless lemmings milling about. And the Janitor character that Nicolas Cage portrayed was just so ridiculous that it was actually funny to witness.My rating for this from writer G.O. Parsons and director Kevin Lewis lands on a generous four out of ten stars. Chance are, actually, that ""Willy's Wonderland"" might actually turn out to become that particular guilty pleasure movie for some viewers, I think.","4","paul_haakonsen"," It was pretty bad alright...

"5048","The concept behind this movie had all the makings of a classic horror comedy.
Alas, instead of becoming the kind of movie you can watch a dozen times, you will struggle to get much enjoyment out of a single viewing of Willy's Wonderland.Where this film goes horribly wrong is in its execution. Instead of wacky characters and zany antics soaked in blood, this film offers a disjointed mess that fails to deliver on horror, comedy, or suspense. There are no jokes, no jump scares, and not much in the way of depth. The dialog is forced, the characters one dimensional, their actions illogical, the plot one we've seen a thousand times before, the cinematography lackluster, and the editing disjointed, at best.To be clear, the problem was not with Nicholas Cage. He seems to have an almost preternatural gift for playing anti-heroes. Even without saying a word, he can come across as a likable bad guy with a heart of gold. No, it is in spite of Cage's involvement, not because of it, that this film falls flat.Watching this movie I could not help wondering what a more experienced and/or talented director might have made of it. Unfortunately, that is something we will never know. What audiences are left enduring is a meandering mess that fails to offer much entertainment value; instead, serving up only a big helping of wasted potential.","5","lusciousmuffins"," Wasted Potential

"5049","Willys Wonderland is by no means a good movie. If you're expecting a tense atmospheric horror movie inside a Chuck E. Cheese, you've come to the wrong movie.
This is a self aware black comedy with some decent gore and crazy kills, and another fun performance from Nick Cage. He's fully aware of the roles he's taking nowadays and he clearly has a blast making this one too, without saying a single word. His presence really helps this movie too, as he knew exactly what tone to go for.
As of right now this is probably the closest we're going to get to a Five Nights At Freddie's movie, and it's a fun enough time to pass 90 minutes. Just don't expect a James Wan level horror.","7","jrugg19"," If You Weren't Entertained, you're Lying.

"5052","I'm a fan of the Five Night's at Freddy's video game series and the similarities between the games and this film had me intrigued. Obviously going into Willy's Wonderland I wasn't expecting a cinematic classic and was looking forward to a fun B movie. Five Nights at Freddys, Nicholas Cage, some 80's inspired cheesy
horror, how could it go wrong!? Turns out pretty easily.The film struggled to find an identity. Is it a horror? Well there's no real suspense or scares. Is it a comedy? The majority of the jokes fall flat. Is it an action film? Cage awkwardly beats up a couple of animatronics, so it has that going for it.The decision for Nicholas Cage's character to be mute throughout the film was a brave decision and one that didn't work in my opinion. Would have probably have been better if they gave him some dialogue (Think Arnie levels in Terminator) especially early on as some scenes just felt empty.
Emily Tosta was good as the young heroine playing opposite Cage, although she probably needed a little bit more direction in the action scene's. Her character definitely came across as the most real, overcoming the limitations in script and direction.Like most horror films the film is filled with stupid people making stupid decisions. Cage could easily have just left once he realised what was going on. But after every attack by an animatronic he went back to playing pinball and cleaning the restaurant like he was trying to become employee of the month. The group of teenagers who were too scared to enter and wanted to burn the building down to end the curse predictably ended up going inside. Then once inside rather than leaving again they split up and sneaked off to have sex.Sadly a film that had the potential to be a cheesy fun filled over the top action scare fest just fell flat and even the star power of Nicholas Cage couldn't save it.","5","jamhough"," Some questionable creative choices let it down

They see the man inside and try to lure him out. Seeing his refusal, they go inside to warn him of the danger. They soon see that he has it under control when he attacks the creepy characters that attack him. Meanwhile, the group engages in a struggle for survival against the creatures.The police hear of the people killed inside and upon seeing the man inside believe he is responsible for the deaths, even though one of the girls in the group try to tell them otherwise.This movie is very similar in tone to the Banana Split Movie and is recommended for fans of that movie or perhaps Child's Play. Anyone who is looking for a movie that's fun, gory, and doesn't take itself too seriously will find much to love here.","8","EvilDead6218"," A fun and entertaining horror romp

"5061","When a drifter (Nicolas Cage) blows out all four tires in the remote town of Hayesville, he finds himself without the means to have the tires replaced and the car repaired. The mechanic works out a deal with a drifter where if he can spend the night cleaning the dilapidated children's play place, Willy's Wonderland, he'll have the car repaired and ready the next morning. The drifter agrees and soon finds his job offer didn't mention that homicidally insane animatronics that inhabit Willy's. Meanwhile Liv (Emily Tosta), the teenage daughter of the town's sheriff organizes herself and her friends to rescue the drifter and burn down Willy's knowing the secret behind the murderous animatronics.Willy's Wonderland is an expansion of the 1 minute short by writer G. O. Parsons titled Wally's Wonderland. Parson's was dissatisfied with the original short and sought to iron out the flaws by making a feature film and putting it on the Blood List where it managed to gain traction and managed to hook Nicolas Cage for the lead who was quite passionate about the project even going so far as to suggest the species of the various animatronics (notably requesting more reptilian creatures). When the trailer was released it found itself compared to the video game Five Nights at Freddy's not unlike an earlier animatronic based horror film, The Banana Splits Movie. Both director Kevin Lewis and writer Parsons deny any influence from Five Nights at Freddy's, but the fact that a legal team apparently analyzed the script for any possible copyright infringement shows that was probably a major factor in the movie. In terms of movies that the internet has compared to Five Nights at Freddy's, Willy's Wonderland is much better than The Banana Splits Movie in both craft, skill, and passion, but even at a rather brisk 80 minute runtime (not including credit) the film does feel rather stretch with material that does fall into the trap of repetition.One of the stranger parts of Willy's Wonderland is Nicolas Cage's mute protagonist. From the first time we see Cage's nameless drifter he doesn't utter a single syllable and conveys everything in his character through facial expressions and body language. It's definitely an interesting choice giving how well known Cage is for both his distinctive voice and his trademark yells and rants that have made up many a YouTube supercut, but as a performance it's definitely a good one. The performance is definitely a throwback to ""men of action"" protagonists who say little if anything archetypes. As far as archetypical characters go while Cage's drifter is stone faced and stoic for much of the running time, he does get a good chance to cut loose especially when we see him drinking energy drinks and playing pinball. There's a very surreal humor at play with Cage's stoicism where he takes getting attacked by killer animatronics in stride yet remains dead set on fulfilling his agreement to clean up the place.The animatronics are actually really well done. While some animatronics hide the ""suit"" illusions better than others, the animatronics are well choregraphed and for the most part convey what we'd expect killer Chuck-E-Cheese characters to sound and look like. The animatronics aren't all that scary past the 25 minute mark, but in the initial build up there are some scenes that did get some solid jumps out of me while I was watching them. Director Kevin Lewis does a good job of establishing Willy's Wonderland and the animatronics and it feels like a fully fleshed out character in and of itself with it glowing mazes, creepy songs, and neon lighting giving the film a strong sense of style and identity.The movie's main drawback is that it runs into issues of keeping the novelty of the concept fresh. After the second Animatronic attack sequence, there's a noticeable Rhythm at play with the drifter cleaning, the animatronic taunts him, drifter fights the animatronic, drifter cleans again, drifter goes on break to play pinball, repeat. The movie never really breaks from that formula and the only thing it can do is have it take place in different locations in Willy's Wonderland, and it's not big enough considering how many animatronics there are. The movie adds in Liv and her friends who are all basically slasher movie characters (final girl, loud mouth, promiscuous one, nerd, etc.) and they've pretty obviously been inserted to rack up the body count because when they do come into Willy's Wonderland, the drifter pays them almost no mind as he continues mindlessly cleaning and doing his pinball breaks even when the slaughter happens. There's definitely a dark humor at play as he'll continue going on breaks even in the middle of a showdown with another animatronic, but like the early section it pretty quickly falls into formula and the pattern becomes predictable.With that said the movie does keep just enough surprises to keep it from becoming dull (including a sequence set to ""Head Shoulders Knees & Toes"" that was gleefully insane, and the explanation of what's going on and how Willy's Wonderland came to be shows the makers of this movie aren't taking it seriously and are just trying to have fun with the premise. Luckily most of that fun is experienced by the audience and there's enough bizarre ""What the f---!?"" moments that I was never bored. I don't think the film reaches the levels of gleeful insanity it wants to but it gives a good try and you can tell it's giving a good try. If this had been a 30 minute segment of a horror anthology film or a segment on the Creepshow TV series I'd probably be giving this a better review than I am. I don't want to sound like I'm Damning with faint praise because I'm not, I really did enjoy most of this movie. And I think if you give it a rental, you will too.Willy's Wonderland takes a gleefully insane premise and delivers it with passion and energy to spare. While the film does settle into a very noticeable rhythm at certain points, the filmmakers sprinkle in just enough to build upon set pieces and keep the film moving with fun shock and spatter moments and an offbeat sense of humor. Nicolas Cage still manages to give a good performance despite playing a mute character and there's a sense of passion and drive in the movie that makes it enjoyably crazy.","6","IonicBreezeMachine"," Just enough moments of fun insanity to overcome a very anemic premise and repetitive structure.

"5062","When I first heard about this movie I fully expected to enjoy it. And so I have. Yet this is so much more than I bargained for, or could have anticipated: 'Willy's Wonderland' is genuinely brilliant.Let's get this out of the way now: I was expecting a wild splatterfest as animatronics suddenly begin running wild, lots of blood and screams rounded out with another outrageous performance from Nicolas Cage. But if you go into 'Willy's Wonderland' expecting anything like the typical horror movie, you're going to be disappointed. 'Wonderland' takes a very different approach.Where to begin? How about the fact that Nic Cage doesn't have a single line of dialogue in the entire film, at most only uttering yells of exertion? Or that we are given no information whatsoever about his character except for the dog tags we see hanging from his rearview mirror? Clearly he has training that makes him an efficient destroyer of animatronics, but we get no further detail - and we don't need it, either.What really speaks volumes about 'Willy's Wonderland' is the flow of the narrative for the first 30 minutes: Having taken on the temporary job as a janitor, Cage's unnamed character works fastidiously to clean the attraction. He sets an alarm on his wristwatch to take very punctual breaks, during which times he meticulously cleans an old pinball machine in the break room and faithfully downs a generic ""Punch"" soda from his collection. What we get is essentially a cleaning montage - interspersed with fights that end in gruesome fatalities. When they're over, it's time to clean up, put on a fresh shirt, then get back to work.Even after those first two kills, even after Liv (Emily Tosta) and her friends show up with intent to burn Willy's to the ground, even when blood begins flowing freely, even as the climax approaches - when that alarm goes off, the fighting and cleaning stops, and another soda and round of pinball ensues. The most emotive Cage gets in the entire picture is during his great triumph at the cabinet.THAT is the sort of movie you're watching.The absolute joy of 'Willy's Wonderland' is that it doesn't take itself seriously, but it pretends that it does. Everything is portrayed with 100% deliberate deadpan delivery. I'm immediately reminded of John Carpenter's criminally underappreciated 'Ghosts of Mars' - 'Wonderland' is ridiculously over the top in every way, employing every trope and boneheaded narrative choice that it can. In another movie we'd laugh at these things and rightly point at them as detractions, but in the right hands, with sharp and pointed writing, it becomes a brazen, shameless delight.There are amusingly needless Dutch angles (one in particular with lighting that reminds me of 'Mandy,' arguably Cage's most perfect film), characters choosing to make out in the middle of a bloodbath, and an incredulously ignorant supporting character who consistently makes all the worst choices. Every bit of actual background plot, every bit of information about Willy's, is spilled out in two big chunks of dialogue by two different characters. Complicit locals, Satanic rituals, a minor ""gotcha"" ending, gratuitous lens flare, over the top shaky cam as Cage's janitor makes kills, the decidedly biting borrow of a line made famous by a well-regarded graphic novel: You name it, 'Wonderland' has got it.G. O. Parsons' writing is impeccable, absolutely matching the drily sardonic wit Carpenter demonstrated in my beloved 'Ghosts of Mars.' I love Ã‰moi's original score, music at once atmospheric and driving that perfectly complements every scene as it plays out - and the small songs they crafted for the feature are very enjoyable, especially the titular theme that we get to hear in full during the end credits. The animatronics look great - suitably creepy, as they would be even without being monstrous murdering muppets - as do the blood and gore effects, which are just plain fun. The whole picture is crisp and clear, and Ryan Liebert's editing is exquisite.Nicolas Cage of course gets the most focus from the camera, and his understated performance is riveting. Still, everyone else is just as fine. I think special mention must be made for Jessica Graves Davis, seen here as animatronic Siren Sara. The most humanoid of the antagonists, there's a bit of Uncanny Valley going on here in her very appearance, and Davis apparently did her own stuntwork as Sara, too. Those athletics remind me of Daryl Hannah's Pris, in 'Blade Runner,' and the overall result is that she's decidedly the most creepy part of the movie.I do have to wonder how much of the budget went to securing the rights for 'Free bird.' But again: It's use is just another perfect addition to the mood of the film, and part of an ending I truly love, bringing the narrative to a deeply satisfying close.By the nature of the narrative, 'Willy's Wonderland' is going to appeal to a certain niche audience. The flavor of the narrative means it will genuinely appeal to an even more select number of viewers. It's not what you expect, but it's what we needed, and it's altogether splendid.It won't be for everyone, but I will never not sing the praises of 'Willy's Wonderland' or withhold a recommendation. It's such a great pleasure, a joy, and you're truly missing out if you don't give it a watch.","9","I_Ailurophile"," Fantastically fun and clever

"5064","2.5 out of 5 stars.Willys Wonderland is a pretty bad comedy horror film about a mute Janitor (Nicolas Cage) which his car breaks down. And he takes an overnight job at Willys wonderland. Which is a kids party place with animatronics. Which he is supposed to clean up overnight. While all the animatronics comes to life. And a group of teens wanting to break in and take the place down cause it is a towns curse.Dumb plot. Dumb direction. The film is just stupid and has its fun moments. Which is the direction it is trying to aim for. Nicolas Cage never speaks in the film. Just giving that glare stare down throughout the movie. Sure he must had fun playing the character which just pokes fun at what it is trying to be.The rest of the cast is forgettable. The direction feels like a bad comedy horror film that was made in the 80s. The premise almost seems similiar to Five nights at freddys. With animatronics characters coming to life and attacking the living. The teen characters in the film were stereotypical as stupid characters. And getting killed off.If your looking for a dumb horror comedy that does not take itself seriously. This movie would be perfect for you.

It wasn't terrible but at the same time it wasn't that entertaining. There just isn't enough here.I actually thought this movie would've probable been better with someone other than Nic Cage in the lead.

It is a decent choice if you want to just have fun, with some meaningless violence and nonsense. It is basically a meme.What I did not enjoyed at all were all were the kids. They are useless and they do not add anything to the plot. This could have been just the typical ""single guy vs. everyone"" kind of film.

"5074","IN A NUTSHELL:
We all think the Country Bear Jamboree at Disneyland is charming and creepy at the same time, right? Willy's Wonderland is the Country Bear Jamboree on evil steroids. If you're a cult fan of ""Cage Rage"", you'll get a laugh out of this comedy/horror movie where Nicolas Cage kicks animatronic butt with a mop and dances, all without ever saying a single word. If that sounds like a terrible way to spend your time, skip this one.Screen Media launches this quirky horror film directed by Kevin Lewis. It's about a quiet loner (Nicolas Cage) who finds himself stranded in a remote town when his car breaks down. Unable to pay for the repairs he needs, he agrees to spend the night cleaning Willy's Wonderland, an abandoned family fun center. But this wonderland has a dark secret that this ""Janitor"" is about to discover. He soon finds himself locked in an epic battle with possessed animatronic mascots that roam the halls. To survive, he must fight his way through each of them.The first-time screenwriter, G. O. Parsons, liked the idea of a simple story. In a press release, he stated, ""I didn't plan on it being a major motion picture."" He was a struggling actor and a friend urged him to write a screenplay. He admits he has a love of watching breaking robots. When the screenplay wasn't immediately picked up, he utilized an Indiegogo campaign and as soon as it was announced that Nicolas Cage would star in the film, the money flowed. Well, it's still a low-budget movie at $5 million dollars, but enough to bring this wacky concept to the Big Screen....or your small TV screen in the case of this Video On Demand release.THINGS I LIKED:
The director stated that Nicolas cage is his own genre. Agreed! I've always liked Nicolas Cage, even though my kids make fun of him. He definitely has a cult following and that's who this film is for. About the script for this movie, he said, ""I thought it was original and absurd and I like things that are absurd. I found it hilarious and potentially terrifying. I don't get opportunities to act with giant stuffed ostriches or alligators or turtles or weasels. So I thought that would be a lot of fun."" His character never says a word during the entire film. He said he got his inspiration from other actors who never spoke in movies, like Harpo Max and Buster Keaton. This Nicolas Cage's 8th horror movie.
The film was shot in only 20 days and finished right before the pandemic hit the United States.
The animatronic suits were designed by Ken Hall. The movie had to be shot chronologically because the suits couldn't be used again after Nicolas Cage had his way with them.
With so much crazy in front of the lens, sometimes director Lewis would be tempted to set up a vertiginous canted-angle camera shot, a so-called Dutch angle. ""And we'd think, Gosh, is it too much?"" he recalls. ""And then I'd think: You know what? This is Nic Cage beating up an animatronic weasel. No. Nothing's too much.""
The cast includes Emily Tosta, Caylee Cowan, Terayle Hill, Grant Cramer, David Sheftell, Ric Reitz, and a lot of voice talent to bring the creepy animatronics to life.
I thought Beth Grant did a great job as a psycho sheriff.
Thankfully, the film doesn't take itself seriously. For example, there's a King Kong moment where an alligator gets its jaw cracked open by none other than good 'ole Nic Cage. If you go into the movie knowing it's going to be a classic B-level horror film from the '80s, you might have fun. Remember, this movie isn't for everyone's taste.
Watching the trashed facility get cleaned by a persistent Nicolas Cage was somehow therapeutic.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
There's a LOT of exposition at the 40-minute mark that tries to make sense of the ridiculous plot. Fifteen minutes later, there's another long exposition scene.
The director loves to aim the camera at the actors' boots.
Cliched, one-dimensional characters.
I was disappointed that the fight scenes weren't very creative. It's pretty straight-forward brute violence.
The teens are supposed to be terrified by the location, but then two of them decide to ""go at it"" amongst the horror. Dumbest horror movie characters ever.
Some of the acting is really bad.
This type of movie is really not my cup of tea.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This is NOT a movie you want your kids to see.
Lots of violence with blood splatters and gore
Profanity and F-bombs
A couple of teenagers go at it. You see lots of movement and hear noises.

"5079","""Willy's Wonderland"" is the antidote we currently need and deserve, and I'm endlessly happy just seeing Cage in this very self-aware offering from director Kevin Lewis and writer G. O. Parsons. Nobody could conclude that ""Willy's Wonderland"" is a great, compelling, substantial, or original film, but ain't no mistaking what kind beast this is. An 80's-throwback-trash-splatter-B horror in the best traditions, with Cage sailing this ship with unbeatable charisma and content. It's the kind of cheese fest that just begs to be loved.A Quiet (absolutely literally) and mysterious drifter wounds up crashed by a small town, where the locals trick him into a janitorial gig at the condemned ""Willy's Wonderland"". In the empty family dinner parlor with huge animatronic dolls as the entertainers, the drifter starts his mundane mission that soon becomes a battle of survival against satanic fluffy beings. How can you not be interested in Nicolas Cage fighting animatronic animals with mops, toilet plungers, and more... Doing it all in visceral, all-out fashion. Meanwhile, the thin backstory reveals, as the rest of the characters, the typical ones, also are on a mission to destroy the evils of Willy. The core idea is essentially ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" and the backstory is much the same as Chucky's from ""Child's Play"". These elements are mashed in ""dead by dawn"" scenario, and we got ourselves an adventure. It is the drifter, who's the most interesting and gimmicky character, although many teases about him, and more, are left unfinished. It's rather impressive though, Cage gave an awesome performance without ever saying a single word.It's a film hinging on a singular idea & the abilities of Nicolas Cage, but being aware that helps a great deal, because there is a sense of glee and fun throughout, it is all weird and wacky, violent and colorful. The space is limited, Cage is wordless, and yet filmmakers manage to fill the runtime consistently, though originality, in the end, is not one of the underlined qualities of ""Willy's Wonderland"". Fight sequences can be repetitive, and quite obscured, but for a slasher-type, it's no different than most, in regards of flow. Even though it is unmistakably a real B, perhaps at times even C movie, the visual panache pleasantly surprised me, I was never bored. There are plenty of fun songs in the package as well, and I have very conflicting feelings about the inclusion of Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Free Bird"" near the end. Must have cost them most of the budget... Conflicting feelings, because it is the ending song of one of my favorite horror movies of all time, ""The Devil's Rejects"". Felt like a steal.The very fact that we now have a no-frills B horror comedy where Nicolas Cage goes through bloody battles with huge fluffy animatronic creatures, is amazing. A slasher that delivers the expected, with a side of mmm cheese sauce. Cage is on the right path, and I'm always legitimately happy to see him work, he's the Man and can make my day. Thank You. I'd also suggest not wasting your time and hating, if B horror is not your jam, ""Willy's Wonderland"" is balls-to-the-wall exactly that. My rating: 6/10.","6","TwistedContent"," Self-Aware and Gleeful B-Movie Awesomeness with just the right Man at the front

"5081","What a delightfully weird little action-horror film. I was originally going to give it a 6 or a 7, but I honestly can't think of anything else they could have done to make the movie better.It is what it is.Nicholas Cage turns in a completely wordless performance as a stranger drifting through towns with an uncanny ability to dish out (and take) pain, while guzzling down what is essentially a power-up pop drink.His character acts very similarly to the one from Drive Angry 3D, almost giving the impression that this could very well be a non-canonical prequel to that film.However, take that character and throw him into what's essentially the basic premise of Five Nights at Freddy's and you get Willy's Wonderland.I agree with a few other reviewers that this film acts on certain levels of B-movie camp without going too far into the realm of the absurd (based on the worldbuilding it receives), and is definitely worth comparing to films like Evil Dead 2.The effects are oftentimes cheap (due to the budget) and there aren't many locations on display, but with the little they had to work with the film is instantaneously a cult classic.Unlike some of Cage's other flicks, like the infinitely unwatchable Jiu-Jitsu, which was just bad all the way around, Willy's Wonderland has its heart (and gore) in the right place, and is a fast-moving thrill-ride from practically start to finish. The quick-edit segments reminded me a lot of Sam Raimi's style of directing, and the use of practical blood effects were sparingly but wisely used.If you want something a little bit different from the typical horror fanfare, I would definitely recommend Willy's Wonderland. Also, if you're a fan of horror films where the hero actually FIGHTS back, then you will love this movie to death.","10","cyguration"," Five Nights At Freddy's + Drive Angry 3D

"5103","Let me be clear: I did not willfully watch this. This movie is quite masterful in that it masters the art of telling nothing. With an hour and a half, Nicky Cage and 5 million dollars, it managed to tell nothing. There is no plot. Half of the characters have no lines (or I'd wish they had no lines, they're just that bad). This movie is a black hole. It sucks in your time, your will to live, and your brain, feasting off of it all like a parasite. In this way, life imitates art. Just as the animÃ©tronics suck away life, this movie also sucks away life. Just like Kathy sucks ****, this movie sucks ****.My friends pressured me into watching it, despite my best senses. In this way, my experience with this movie is my fault and I ruined my own life. At times I was secretly hoping that this movie was real, for then I could sacrifice my godforsaken friends to the animemetronics and then join them in tormenting my friends for eternity.A lot of people call this a B-grade film. I think that's quite generous. Those people are kinder souls than I. However, not all is bad. This film is definitely an experience, and your life will be changed forever once you're done. Whether that's for better or worse, it doesn't matter because you just wasted 90 minutes of your life and you will never get a chance to fix that.If you have nothing left to lose, and yet you still want to lose something, I'd recommend this movie. Or if you want to give someone the mens rea to go through with your murder, I'd also recommend it. Or if you're deranged enough to watch it for the meme, then go ahead (and promptly get some help following that).","9","randomtrp"," So bad it's bad

"5107","Despite not being a huge fan of FNAF, the concept is pretty cool, but to make it a good movie takes dedication, a good script, a talented director and a decent budget. ""Willy's Wonderland"" has none. The opening sequence starts with Nicholas Cage who is 60, pretending to be on his late 30's driving a sports car and has an unhealthy obssesion with energy drinks. He has no lines during the entire movie, I guess he's supposed to play the silent protagonist in video games since obviously this movie is inspired from a video game, but it just doesn't work. His character has no backstory and gets boring since he doesn't get any character development as the movie goes on. He also seems to have some sort of superhuman strength as he is the only one who is capable of destroying any of the animatronics with little effort. The other characters in the movie are either there just to be killed or for some plot exposition. And some of them do REALLY stupid things! There is one moment in the movie where two teens have sex inside the ""Willy's Wonderland"" while being perfectly aware that killer animatronics are watching them and are about to kill them, one of the teens even say ""let's give them a show!"" Absolute cringe. As for the animatronics, it initally starts good with them being pretty creepy and staring at the actors when they're not looking, but once they start talking it goes downhill from there. Most of their dialogue consists of insulting the characters with crude language that is neither scary or funny. Having them not talk would have made them scarier. The special effects are cheap too. Some of the animatronics are clearly people in costumes, and it really ruins the movie's concept. Overall I don't recommend this film.","2","olddaniel"," Another horrible FNAF rip-off

"5109","This movie is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen. Cage doesn't say a word the entire film, the victims do the dumbest things they possibly could in the lisle of a situation they know is untenable and will likely result in their deaths... The ""storyline"" is some kind of weird nonsense about the town sacrificing people to possessed animatronics which now house the souls of serial killers?I don't know... The action sequences are poorly shot, even more poorly choreographed, Ava ultimately stuck fun of of the movie. I mean, it could have been very entertaining with some effort, but none was given, and so it is not. We watched PG: Psycho Goreman right after this, and we loved that... I mean PG is ridiculous, but it's hilarious and clearly a labor of love for 80s and 90s shows imagined through a lens of bizarre humor.I only bring that up,bbecause that is what it feels they wanted WW to be, but falls short everywhere; its just not a good movie, at all.","2","sikkwolf"," Nicholas Rage is slowly becoming irrelevant

"5112","Now that is a reference to a doll ... which I falsely thought was the main bad guy(s) in this ... but it is animatronics. Not just any animatronics as we learn during the run time of the movie. But more on that in the movie. There is not much ""story"" here and while I thought our ""Janitor"" would get some backstory himself, this never happens ... as the filmmakers say, it is in the tradition of the Western movies ... the silent, nameless ""avenger"", who comes to clean town ... or hallways/rooms/bad souls.Having said all that, the movie is as insane as you may think when you read what it is about. And what better choice than Nicolas Cage to play the main/lead role? Exactly - you may have issues with the twenty something year old being attracted to him - but it's a movie and it's Nicolas Cage and ... I mean is that really the main issue you have here? Well congratulations then! This is a movie you shouldn't think too much about ... it is simply there for the viewer to have fun ... blood and gore and one ""sexy time scene"" amidst all the madness. Though I think it's even worse that they don't even take off all their clothes, if they are as horny and mad as they claim to be (not Cage and his admirer, some side characters).Again just do not think about this in any way shape or form ... just enjoy the mayhem ... and maybe call Cage to clean up your house ... though his rate might be high, he's doing an awesome job!","8","kosmasp"," Silence!

"5113","Now I like Nicholas Cage not a die hard fan but I am more into Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Van Damme, Seagal, Willis, Snipes, Chan, Statham many more action stars, Nicholas Cage is a great actor when he is in action it's brilliant sometimes with him and in different topics not so great like with Wicker Man and many other direct to DVD movies sadly I reckon Drive Angry, Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance, Mandy, Kill Chain were the last movies I enjoyed but rest of recent work sucked just like this film I loved Con Air, Face/Off, The Rock, Snake Eyes, 8mm, Gone in 60 Seconds, Windtalkers, Lord of War, Ghost Rider 1&2, Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, rest of that sucked until he did Drive Angry witch I think it's most underrated film one of last films I enjoyed then when he comeback to cinema release he did Ghost Rider Spirit with a Vengeance that's it for me it's was end of line I thinkNicholas Cage films were over for me. Then years later he did Mandy (2018) hey wanna film like this but it's Nicolas Cage, Raging killing cults is miles better then this movie here, then Kill Chain I enjoyed then you got this worst crap film that everyone enjoyed??? I thought this movie was nothing to me look I understand Nicholas Cage is mystery character he is quiet drifter all that I totally understand but besides that this is a campy movie it takes place entire film. Nicholas Cage did good in movie nothing to say about his performance, but I thought cute hot Mexican girl Emily Tosta she did fine in movie I liked her character she wanted to burn down abandoned family entertainment center I like girls with tough personality character but she can't hold this movie up sadly to say, I hated this kids song it's playing all over again, I thought other characters were annoying other kids and Sheriff hated that I love silly horror like this movie but I am not into animatronic mascots horror type because Ithink it's silly but I enjoyed Nicholas cage beating crap of those animatronic mascots I really do it was funny, but their wasn't enough of that action I wish their was guns in involved so Nicholas Cage and Emily Tosta shooting blowing those evil animatronic mascots up I wanted something more out of it but it wasn't I like I hate campy movies where movie it takes one place nah problem is movie is too generic and it felt cheap, keeping Nicholas Cage quiet was just weird director wanted film to be like Pale Rider meets Freddy Five Nights cool idea but I don't know movie wasn't for me. Film was Boring, slow and changed just enough to avoid copyright to Freddy Five Nights I am surprised that they haven't sue director or writers of this movie for copyrighting that idea for this movie expect it's not called Freddy Five Nights. I thought most stupidest idea of movie is that group of people that were owners that were satanic ritual to transfer their souls into the animatronic characters witch I thought it was stupidest idea ever dumbest idea how about someone made those animatronic were built to kill people designed animatronic that's idea I prefer, and it's hard movie to sit threw never liked it expect when Nicholas Cage kills animatronic that's was about it but rest of movie sucked I highly not recommded seeing it unless you risk it and see it for free I don't know why people liked this movie it's wasn't for me it sucked.","1","nikola17"," it was just hard to sit threw this movie

"5117","It's hard to dive into a detailed review of a film like Willy's Wonderland. It's the kind of film that's trying to do one thing and one thing alone; Entertain people. If I don't end up praising the film for anything else, that's okay. Willy's Wonderland is a straight-up B-Movie and uses a heavy grindhouse feel to tell its story. Am I going to recommend this one to mainstream audiences? Absolutely not, but if you know what to expect, I think you'll have a blast watching it as I did. There's nothing here but the novelty, but here's why it works.Right off the bat, something felt off about this film. It opens with a very drab look and Nicolas Cage is revealed as the stoic cool guy (which is done incredibly over the top). Willy's Wonderland is an old arcade/birthday party place that has been closed down, due to the fact that the mechanical robots inside all come to life and murder people. Nicolas Cage's character's car breaks down and the mechanic tells him he can get it fixed for free if he cleans this building and makes it ready to reopen. Spending a night in Willy's Wonderland as his car is being fixed, this movie is strictly a film about a Janitor cleaning rooms and killing robots. When you look at it like that, it really works, but if you're looking for something note-worthy, you need to look elsewhere.It's no denying that Nicolas Cage likes to have fun with the roles he chooses. He used to be a very solid dramatic actor, but the craziness of his performances has been there since the beginning as well. This is why I found the choice to make his character mute to be very surprising. Not having one single line throughout the entire film was a bold move, but it made it that much more enjoyable honestly. His facial expressions and the fact that he just really loves soda is enough to know that he means business and has no fear. If that sounds dumb and ridiculous, that's because it is, but it also works.As I said, if you go into this film looking for anything else other than Nicolas Cage fighting robots, you're going to be let down. With that said, the film also gets very repetitive along the way. Once you realize just how many of these robots there are, I found myself counting until he was done. This took away from the little tension (or lack thereof) there was. It's an enjoyable movie that begins to feel its length on multiple occasions.In the end, Willy's Wonderland promises Cage fighting robots and it delivers. This is also G. O. Parsons' very first feature film as a writer and this might sound crazy, but I hope he gets the chance to write another film. I think his wacky ideas could lead to something great one day. Now available on-demand, Willy's Wonderland realistically will likely be hated by many viewers, but I had quite a bit of fun watching it. Take that statement however you like, but if you know, you know. That's about the highest praise I can give this film.","6","kjproulx"," If you know what to expect you'll have fun

This is no instant Classic or Masterpiece but it's a wild ride & humourous bloody B-movie good time with music & it's look is very 80's in style & it could've came out then & would've made more sense coming out during the 80's lol. Good Fun.","7","lukem-52760"," Bizarre, wacky, mental & kick-ass!!!

"5124","I found myself kind of enjoying this film for what is was, a dark comedic horror show.Cage's role as an ex-military, soda pop drinking, no talking, badass was pretty good. His single minded pursuit of completing his job of cleaning the place was great, not letting demonic animatronic puppets or teenagers getting killed left and right get in his way. Even the name of character was great, simply being listed as ""The Janitor"".I thought it was a good way to kill an hour and a half in an evil dead sort of way.","7","sflanagan-47676"," Chuck E Cheese Meets Devil Worshipers

"5128","Saw an advanced screening - this was the most excited I've been to see a movie in a very long time. It appears I'm in the minority who found it to be, frankly, terrible. While the performances of the leads were enjoyable, I found the movie's writing and direction so flawed as to be practically unwatchable.Gadot continues to embody WW laudably, if leaning at times toward overacting. Pine is effective as the ""fish out of water"" launched several decades into the future, even if some of his comedic moments with Gadot fall flat. Pascal plays a classically over-the-top 80's villain with enthusiasm - it seems he relishes every moment getting to play a bad guy. For me, Wiig gave the strongest performance of the first act - her comedic timing is given plenty of time to shine, and the audience has ample opportunity to empathize with her. Unfortunately, these four performances were not enough to dig this film out of the hole the writers created.Written with an over-inflated sense of self-importance, riddled with clunky dialogue trying desperately to convey depth and universal truths, the end result is an endless stream of cringeworthy, eye roll inducing lines that are so on the nose I wonder how they made it out of the writing room. At no point does the film treat its audience with intelligence, opting instead to spoon-feed every concept. How do they convey that WW is not only an action hero, but an advocate for the humanity in all of us? By forcing her to deliver gems like ""But Barbara, what about your warmth? What about your humanity?""Further issues, presented as they occur to me as I tire of reflecting on this mess:Why is the heist scene so intentionally campy? The movie is *set* in '84, not *made* in '84. Fortunately the remainder of the film abandons this style.Their *most* creative way to sell Barbara as awkward but likable is to have her drop her briefcase of papers? Couldn't come up with something original?All Smithsonian employees have access to an unguarded airfield? A WWII pilot can understand the controls?No fully-fueled fighter jet has a range to fly DC to Cairo.WW has only ever vanished a coffee mug in all her trying, but can suddenly vanish the jet ""because she must"".""I know we're racing against time to save the world, but let's go fly through some fireworks. It'll look cool, promise.""One moment WW can effortlessly sprint pushing a disabled armored vehicle down the road, the next she can't push two of them apart with all her might.The moment she rolls along the road with the two children in her arms is astonishingly poor CGI. Throughout the film, the most obviously CGI'd elements simply have no weight to them.Don't play the audio of Steve's ""how to fly"" speech over the moment WW takes it to heart and learns. Trust your actors and audience. Show, don't tell.Max didn't think to steal health in return for wishes until the end of the third act?Cheetah has practically zero screen time to pose a real threat. One fight and she's dealt with handily.Hundreds of nukes launched, and they don't vanish - they crumble in mid-air. This is somehow not a problem for the planet?Returned to the white house grounds, Max somehow lands within yards of his son who has been wandering abandoned highways?Linda Carter's cameo was *painful*. If she didn't actually smile and wink into the camera, it sure as hell felt like she did. I won't be re-watching to find out for sure.I'm tired of griping. I wanted so badly to like this continuation of the DCEU. I'll be there for the next one hoping for better, but my god was this a disappointment. I saw the movie for free and the cost was still too high.","2","dmbelafan"," Must have seen a different movie.

It's like a train wreck and a dumpster fire had a baby, then the baby puked and that puke became this movie. Seriously, what were they thinking with this script? So many talented actors and so much wasted potential.So, because the script says so, Diana can make things disappear at will? She can swing from lighting with her lariat? She can block and catch bullets with her lariat? She can attach and swing from airplanes that are at cruising altitude while she's on the ground?! All of these exaggerated abilities while she's supposedly losing her powers? Another thing, her suit was supposed to be powerful, yet it crumbled like tinfoil during her five minute fight with Cheetah. What was the point of her wearing it then if she was back at full strength?Max Lord's character was laughable. The stone wasn't crumbling with every wish, so why was he getting sick after granting wishes even though he became the stone?

Unfortunately, the stylized action and good CGI that helped make the previous installments rise above the writing is not present here. The CGI is bad and there isn't much action.

From the moment it starts it comes off almost as a parody. The open scene is very childish. Way too on the nose with its moralistic foreshadowing. The following failed heist is equally juvenile - taking place in a mall and is just plain silly. It's far from the grittier atmosphere that DC has been so good at recently.The interpretation of 80's culture is completely distracting and strips away any gravitas. Pedro Pascal comes off as laughable and inane. Wiig fairs no better and cannot pull off the baddie.It was hard to watch.

"5158","I agree with the review ""utter disappointment"", I also read the Washington Post article. "" really getting to do whatever I wanted"" she said. And what a sad commentary that turned out to be. All of her characters, props and settings were ridiculous. Kristen Wiig injects one of her babbling SNL characters in her first scene. A super villian she's not, even for comic relief. And where is the strong empowered woman that encourages other women to use their own powers? Then there is that magic lasso, Diana might just as well sat and her desk in the museum and flicked it to and fro since it appeared to have an infinite length this time around. Placing the film in her memories of the '80s this might work for Coppola or Scorsese but one's sense of history needs to be able to look further into the past to develop a view. Was that President supposed to be Reagan, surely you could have found someone who actually resembled him. So much for '80s memories. The scenes of an injured and defeated WW were way to drawn out, and the computers of the day were only beginning to go beyond pixelated pictures. The technology of the day would not have been able to broadcast to the world. And Gal Gadots talents were never realized she just wasn't involved enough beyond window dressing, more attention was spent on the sets and locations. And what disappointment the release streaming and theatre distribution. Although I love theaters (I spent 35 yrsin the movie business) where I live they haven't reopened yet. THe streaming was terrible stop, stutter, freeze. fortunately the movie was so bad the pauses were a relief. I wonder what Bill Diehl or Roger Ebert would have had to say about WW84? I'm glad I watched the credits, I couldn't believe how many people were listed.

The first WW movie was not that great, but Patty did not write that one, this sequel she did and it is worthless. I was wondering if I was watching a drama or a action hero franchise. First the movie is far to long, the dialogue's are pointless and boring, you can skip with ease them because the story is not that complicated. For the action, the effects are good, not worth the time to watch, but still well made, but there are not very much action scenes. If you look at the demographic of the votes you can see girls <18 years are the only ones who love this movie, and that should have been the warning that should have been given with this movie: only see this movie if you are a teenage girl.","4","the_real_smile"," Actionhero movie with almost no action

All the usual tropes: WW loses some of her powers, so there can be suspense; she plays Spiderman and holds two vehicles apart. Just nothing new and Gad Gadot proves again that she's a glamour model and poses well. She can't act.

The first scenes were just so stupid and pointless.

"5174","The 1st WW film was absolutely brilliant and had more ticks than a farmer's dog in my book. WW84 is, which truly saddens and maddens me, the polar opposite.

I did love the opening island scene where the girl actress playing the young Diana was superb, and apparently did all her non-cgi stunts. But then it went downhill faster than an illiterate skier passing a 'Warning - cliff ahead' sign.
I won't go into detail over WW84s failings as I have a bus to catch...in a week, but I think I can reveal my favourite, jaw-dropping line from the film without it being a spoiler...'...

"5181","The first WW movie was amazing! It clearly demonstrated that a woman super hero can be strong, smart, funny and, most of all, can easily hold her own with her male counterparts. It was a monumental step forward for super hero movies and women in general and I couldn't wait for the sequel. It was very disappointing to see the direction Mrs. Jenkins took this character. The WW in this movie represents and displays all of the stereotypical cliches so many serious actresses have worked for years to dispel. In the first WW she was a badass who fought with passion against evil and stood up for her convictions. In WW84, when she's not pining for her lost love (because we all know a woman is lost without her man, right?) she's winking at little kids while she fights campy bad guys who are literally tripping over themselves to get caught. The female supporting cast isn't much better. Kristen Wiig is the embodiment of the frazzled, clingy stereotype that went out of style in most movies years ago. The only 2 strong women (Connie Nielsen amd Robin Wright) are gone after the first 10 minutes and we are left with weak, campy garbage. The WW in the first film was Christian Bale's Batman. In WW84 we get the Adam West Batman. Such a disappointment.","3","rickgartshore"," Patty Jenkins Sets Women Back w/ This Rubbish

"
"5197","This is gonna be a long one... here we go...First, I'd like to dissect every character one by one, starting with Diana.
I'll get right to it: she's boring. Seriously, she's awful. Gal Gadot makes a great Wonder Woman visually, but her performance lacks a lot. She's just not fun to watch. She has cool scenes and stunts, but she doesn't look like she's having fun. While the film has its serious moments, it does have the sort of wild epic-ness that warrants a more excited heroine.
Even when the script tries to make her ""have fun,"" she just can't. I understand that Wonder Woman is supposed to be a more elegant character in general, but something about Gadot's acting just makes everything fall flat. I don't enjoy seeing her be awesome, because she's not enjoying it either. She's going through the motions of being cool, and just comes off like a depressed and generic good guy.
Aside from her personality, the position they've put Diana in doesn't make sense.
I refuse to believe that Diana hasn't changed her name in 60+ years. Wonder Woman is perhaps the most invaluable superhero; she is quite literally a ""god killer."" One can only imagine that there are many other gods, goddesses, and immortal beings who would want her dead.
I was honestly expecting us to find Diana living off the grid in a low-rent apartment, moving around and working odd jobs to make ends meet (when she wasn't stopping petty crime, of course). But no, we get a rich, high society Diana who works at a museum, flaunting her inhuman knowledge and qualities - basically a sitting duck for her enemies.
But enough about her.Next, we have Steve... oh Steve... you're just the worst. Now, Steve doesn't do anything wrong - he's simply dull as a blank wall. He adds nothing to the story - well, his presence does, but not him as a character. He's expendable; you could swap him out with anyone else and the effect would be the same. Also, Chris Pine has absolutely no chemistry with Gadot; he was clearly only cast because he's considered eye candy for the ladies.Now for the villains... this is where it gets interesting... the bad guys are way better than the heroes. As I said above, Steve and Diana are painfully boring and blank. However, this movie has some of the best villains I've seen in a recent superhero film.Max Lord, played by Pedro Pascal, absorbs the power of an artifact called the Dreamstone, which gives him the ability to grant wishes. However, he also takes something from whoever had their desire granted. Obviously, this goes horribly wrong, and eventually the world descends into chaos. Max (who is loosely inspired by J.R. Ewing from Dallas; change my mind) is a surprisingly engaging character. The actor did a good job portraying him; I know he sounds boring but he stole the show every time he was on screen.Finally, we have Barbara, aka Cheetah. Her story starts a bit slowly, even invoking the age-old trope of a stereotypically dorky girl who becomes confident. But Kristen Wiig actually gives the character enough charisma that she is more likable than Diana. This is what I talked about earlier. Once Barbara becomes Cheetah, she is the kind of character Diana should've been.
She's cool and fun to watch, she looks like she's enjoying the battle, she has spirit - even though she was supposed to be evil, I actually enjoyed seeing her beat up Diana!
Yeah, I know that sounds awful, but this brings me to my final point: what I liked most about this movie was the film's biggest flaw.If I'm rooting for the villains, that means the heroes sucked (which they did). Don't get me wrong, bad guys need to be interesting in a story, but the heroes also need to be charismatic and awesome. I wanted to see Barbara succeed, and once she did, she seemingly surpassed Diana's level. Therefore, it was easier to dislike Diana.Now, onto my final complaint: why on earth was this set in the 80's? Both the title and the marketing for this movie made it seem like it was no mistake that it took place in 1984. Clearly it was for nostalgic purposes, but that's just it... there's no nostalgia. This could've been set in literally any other decade and been the same.
Now, I'm not saying it needed to be heavy-handed, playing cliche and overused songs every five seconds, but there is absolutely nothing in this movie that utilizes its setting. There is one opening scene that takes place in a mall, but it's entirely pointless and could be cut out of the movie.
There were just so many opportunities to make Wonder Woman even cooler with this, like playing rock/synth music while she fights or having her duke it out with Cheetah in a theater while 'The Terminator' is on the screen. But there is nothing of the sort.
Now, this wouldn't be so much of a problem if the year 1984 wasn't such a big part of the plug. If it was just called 'Wonder Woman II' in regular font, who cares. But when you call it 'WONDER WOMAN: 1984' with retro colors and title style, the audience expects more clever nods to the decade.I suppose I've went on and griped enough; in short it's an okay movie but it could've been a lot better.

"5199","I definitely think it deserves more than 1 star, but it doesn't come close to living up to the hype or the hope for a great movie. Beginning is fun when she competes as a little girl and feels like groundwork for the coming story, but then the rest of the movie has nothing to do with the beginning. The mall scene at the beginning is really, really awful! The other fight scenes are just okay but not terrible. The story is pretty bad, but there are far worse. I've never been a fan of the ""superhero loses their powers"" plot line. Steve coming back in someone else's body is super weird. You want him back somehow, but not like that. Cheetah is an interesting idea but they didn't utilize her like they could have. I was expecting an epic matchup between she and Wonder Woman at the end. Not there. If you blink you will miss it. It's just an okay hero movie. It's not great, but better than 1 star.","3","arnkp"," It's pretty awful.

"5205","The sequel to Wonder Woman was rescheduled time and time again because of the emergence of COVID-19 and cinemas being off limits. It's finally been released however but can also be streamed on HBO Max which has made some to say that cinemas may be a thing of the past.So is this sequel as good as it's amazing first film?The film opens with Diana reminiscing to when she was a child and taking part in an Olympics style event in which she excels until she is felled by a tree branch which makes her fall from the horse that carries her but then decides to cheat to try and take the lead. She is found out to have cheated however and whilst she is heartbroken at not having won she is told that her time will come. This opening is in keeping with the first film and is fantastic.But as the film then flashes forward into 1984 it starts to come seriously unstuck. It's easy for films to fall into a kind of exaggerated, unrealistic and truly irritating parody of a decade especially one that is larger than life like the 1980's. The film falls headlong into this trap and so the 80's we see is wall to wall bad fashions, people eating fatty foods in abundance and littering. It feels fake and manufactured. If there was a hashtag that could be used here for the Twitterati it would be #notmy80s. 'Ah but this is the vision of the 80's that is individual to this film and Patty Jenkins' I hear the comic fanboys screaming. Then in that case it just plain sucks.There then comes an action sequence in a shopping mall in which WW foils a robbery. It's so pointless and pathetic that I actually shouted out in the cinema 'This is awful!' I even for a nanosecond thought of walking out. This would have set a new record for the fastest time I've walked out of a film, having lasted only ten minutes watching Freddy Vs Jason.Fortunately the film calms down on the over the top 80's schtick as we see the main narrative for the film- an artefact known as the dreamstone which can fulfil the wish of those who touch it but with a catch. For every wish, the person loses something else dear to them. When I heard of this premise for the film it seemed fine. But as is stated by characters within the film, this is actually based on the urban legend of the 'Monkey's Paw'. When I found this out (and by characters in the actual film!) the premise disintegrated right before my eyes. I felt robbed and the whole premise for the film felt lazy. In fact, very quickly in the film I found myself thinking 'I really don't care what happens to ANY character in this film'. Nothing in the film's runtime swayed me from this.Diana wishes for Steve Trevor to come back and hence this is how we get Chris Pine back in the sequel. However, with this wish coming true we see WW start to lose her powers. The scene where we see him reappear should have had a massive emotional pull for the audience. There was nothing. This film is just like it's depiction of the decade it takes place in- all surface, no depth.We are introduced to the socially awkward Barbara Minerva who wishes to be just like Diana. She gains her wish. She later wishes to be an 'apex predator'. Again, she gets her wish and transforms into supervillianess Cheetah. The first glimpse of Cheetah was so naff I actually burst out laughing.We also get another baddie in the form of 'orange man bad' Max Lord who is based on Donald Trump. Theres even a border wall in the film. Hmmm. The President of the United States in the film is obviously based on Ronald Reagan. There are even allusions to his Alzheimers with him saying that felt completely disorientated and 'somewhere else' during one scene. Or maybe with such as admission he's based on Joe Biden instead.The real problem for me throughout the film are the scenes that involve Wonder Woman which is massively problematic based around her character. The action scenes contain the worst examples of CGI I've seen in a long long time. There are times when Wonder Woman feels more like an action figure in a really badly conceived computer game from the early 00's.There is also a scene in which we are introduced to a new power that Diana unveils. She can turn objects invisible by simply touching them. This made me roll my eyes when I had already rolled them far too many times already. 'Maybe she can also make this film half it's running time' I found myself thinking.Another scene that had me rolling my eyes was when Barbara decides to go to the gym when she discovers she has superstrength and decides to lift weights. There is also another cringy scene when she bumps into the creepy guy who harassed her earlier in the film.But there are scenes that work. When Diana finds out she can fly it's through a statement Steve has made earlier in the film about his love of flying. These scenes are beautiful to behold and don't involve dodgy CGI. This scene works amazingly well. If only the care and attention that had gone into this scene could have been applied to the rest of the film the whole movie would be more of a rewarding experience.I enjoyed the scenes of Max's health getting worse with every wish he bestows. This could have been exploited more with him disintegrating more radically throughout the film a la the undead character in An American Werewolf In London. But I appreciate that that might not have been appropriate in a film aimed primarily at children.When Diana has to say goodbye to Steve so that she can get her powers back, again, there should have been more emotional resonance for the audience. Again, there wasn't any.In fact when I heard that Diana was to lose her powers to get Steve back I instantly thought of Superman 2 with Superman willingly renouncing his superpowers so he can enter a relationship with Lois. But whilst I was hoping for a sequel as good as Superman 2 for Wonder Woman instead we got Superman 4: The Quest For Peace resplendent with a naff call for world peace in a nuclear free world.After the first film I would have wished for a sequel. After seeing Wonder Woman 84, I renounce my wish.","3","meathookcinema"," Wonder Woman 1984: The Quest For Peace. Awful.

"5206","This has to be one of the worst movies of 2020. I waited patiently for this film to release and I was dismayed by what I saw. The action is dull, the acting is wooden and dialogue sounds like it was written by a first time writer. If you love cliches this is your movie. It's filled with them and you just have to roll your eyes. Superman v. Batman is far more superior than this film. Director Patty Jenkins really dropped the ball. The first film was so much better. What blows my mind is that the movie was directed by the same person who directed the first one. I think it was the right decision to split the release between digital and theatrical because it was not going to make its profit back just by doing a theatrical release, let alone on demand. I don't recommend this movie. I'd advise you wait until it's free on tv in about a year. It's that bad. It pains me to be so critical of Wonder Woman because I'm a huge fan. However, I'm not a fan of a director who can't even make a decent sequel. This is the same director who is going to direct Star Wars Rouge Squadron in 2023.

The plot is basic, and has been done before. The setting is 1984, we get it, but really has no bearing on the story, at all. However, the movie sure made sure to show plenty of pastel colors and popped collars, because you know, the 80s.
The CGI is really bad in some places, and the action sequences are also stale and boring. This film does nothing to set up any future stories within the DCEU, or really shed any light on WW, other than the opening scene showing her as a child.
The worst part of all has to be the ending. Max Lord has to touch people to grant wishes, but at the end all he has to do is appear on TV? What!?

"5226","Mutated hillbillies can be a real pain in the arse. And eye socket. Basically, more of the same from the franchise that wants to be the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This time out, instead of Eliza Dushku, we get the quite gorgeous Erica Leerhsen (from... wait, you'll never guess - The Texas chainsaw Massacre remake) and the less than lithe figure of Henry Rollins as the main characters. A reality TV show show called The Apocalypse sets up it's cameras in the same mutant-infested forest as the last film and the local residents quickly set about slicing and dicing the interlopers like an enraged Gordon Ramsey. Body parts fly off in every direction and blood gushes, spurts, leaks, drops, squirts and cascades in virtually every scene. If you could define this movie in one word, it would be ""wet"". There's a gratuitous boob shot and obligatory sex scene to keep the titillation quota up in between the carnage, but there's so little story that you could write it on the back of a matchbox. Not that story actually matters here one little bit. Rollins is an ex-marine turned TV presenter who, when he realises the hills not only have eyes but bear traps, axes and other assorted blunt and sharp weaponry, turns into Arnold Schwarzenegger faster than you can say ""Last twenty minutes of Predator"". I'm not giving anything away by saying the bad guys get killed and the prettiest girl survives, but poor old Hank? Well, let's just say he's not likely to feature in another sequel... All in all, it's your typical teens/twenty-somethings against psychos scenario. All is played out with arse-numbing inevitability, with only the gore and death scenes to keep you wondering what's going to happen next. Basically, if you didn't like the first one, then you'll hate this. Oh, and it contains probably the most unintentionally stupid tagged on twist ending I think I may have ever seen. One of those moments that if you're watching it at the cinema, you'll burst out laughing, feel embarrassed for a second or two before you realising everybody else has done exactly the same.","6","Darkweasel"," More of the same.

Also, its quite entertaining how the genre tries to outbid the last movie with even more cruel gore than the last one. I guess its become a practice , in which they have a violent film, that gets an uncut edition on DVD, so it might sell more.

"5228","In Greenbrier Back Country, West Virginia, the retired military Dale Murphy (Henry Rollins) is hosting a tough survivor show where the winner takes US$ 100,000.00. The proposal of the reality show is to survive in the woods in the most adverse conditions, following predetermined rules. Sooner the contestants find that they are really fighting to survive against a strong, sadistic and violent cannibalistic family with the appearance of monsters. Further, Colonel Dale discloses that many years ago, an abandoned pulp mill released chemical wastes on the creek, killing the animals and transforming the descendants of a local family in deformed mutants. Without animals to hunt or fish to catch, the next generation chases travelers to feed themselves.""Wrong Turn 2: Dead End"" has an unoriginal story that I have seen many times, and seems to be a replay of parts of many other movies, like for example ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""The Hills Have Eyes"", ""Timber Falls"", ""Wrong Turn"" plus breasts of a sexy girl and a collection of clichés of the genre. However, this film is surprisingly good, having more gore and originality in the deaths than the usual; and works, hooking the attention of the viewer until the very last scene. The death of Kimberly Caldwell in the beginning gives a great introduction of how bloody this film is. When I see this type of movie, I try to guess what will happen to the potential victims, if they will survive or die, and the gore resolution of this movie is good. The make-up and the special effects are impressive. In my opinion, fans of the genre will not be disappointed with this film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Floresta do Mal"" (""Forest of the Evil"")","7","claudio_carvalho"," A Replay of Many Other Movies  But with More Gore and Originality in the Deaths

Playing their game in the remote backwoods of West Virginia, they soon find out that deformed hillbillies are hunting them. Having extremely little to do with the first ""Wrong Turn"" (which I enjoyed as a fun lil' diversion), this direct to DVD sequel is surprisingly pretty good none the less. Not only that I truly believe it could be the best DTV sequel of 2007 hands down, thanks to a likable cast, a fun storyline, and not skimping on the gore in the least.My Grade: A- Eye Candy: Crystal Lowe gets topless","9","movieman_kev"," the sad fact that excrement like ""Hills have eyes 2"" gets a theatrical release and THIS doesn't is the real travesty

However, this was done better than most other movies.The plot revolves around a reality TV show in the woods and of course the cannibals are there. It is simple but was good enough to keep me intrigued to go with the movie. There were characters you root for and characters you wanted to die like in any movie, but the way they died was awesome. There was a plethora of blood and guts and even some tense moments.A lot better than most other sequels in regards to similar movies like Jeepers Creepers 2, The Ring 2, The Grudge 2, Hills have eyes II, etc. I do recommend renting this so you can cheer for those awesome gory kills and waiting to see if they get their revenge.","8","Hmrsmpsn"," A movie omelet, but a good one

"5231","Low-rent slasher sequels are usually garbage, I mean has anyone seen Hostel 2, The Grudge 2 or Hills Have Eyes 2? As a result I really wasn't expecting much of this movie despite enjoying the first, not merely for the gorgeous Eliza Dushku either. The premise is nothing new, but the characters, gore and inventive kills make it well worth watching.The always cool Henry Rollins (who I'd pay money just to see reading the bible) plays a retired Army Colonel who is now hosting a faux-post apocalyptic reality game show. The setting: the woods. But not just any woods, this is inbred hillbilly territory and they are only too happy to devour a bunch of young city folks.Erica Leerhseen (who seriously does not look as old as she is) plays Nina, the cynical, jaded one of the group who keeps her cool when the guts start spilling. Usually with these movies you can tell exactly who is going to die and in what order, but Wrong Turn 2 still managed to seem fresh. I wasn't simply waiting for characters to die or wishing that they'd hurry up and meet a grisly end, since such fodder are usually highly annoying.The one thing that I didn't like was the utterly flat photography. The original had a dark, grainy and hardcore look to it but the sequel just seems so clean and bright and open. I think that if Joe Lynch was perhaps a more experienced director then the film would look tighter and more dynamic, as it is the cinematography does little to compliment the above-average production design.If you are a fan of the first movie then I totally recommend that you give this one a go. It surpassed my expectations and I'm usually quite a snob when it comes to movies.","7","CuriosityKilledShawn"," A surprisingly good movie.

"5232","Wrong Turn 2: Dead End, what I expected to be total trash turned out to be one of the better horror sequels in a while. Wrong Turn is a decent horror movie that I usually recommend to my friends, it had a fresh new feel for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre genre. So when my boyfriend and I were looking for a film to watch, we came across Wrong Turn 2: Dead End at the video store, I was like oh, no, another crummy sequel to destroy a fine film. But he wanted to see it, so we watched it last night, I have to say that I was completely wrong about what I thought this film was going to be. Actually, this was a fun horror movie, you didn't even need to see the first one to get it, that was a bonus that not too many sequels give the chance for. Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is a fun and gory sequel that offers lots of blood and entertainment.A group is about to film another ""survivor"" type of reality show in the middle of the woods. It's called ""Apocolypse"" where they have to pretend that the world is gone and they're the only survivors and whoever's left standing wins a hundred grand. But things take a very deadly turn when the gang is attacked by blood hungry hillbilly cannibals who want to have them for dinner, if you know what I mean. So this turns into a real survivor show when the gang is now fighting for their lives and try to make it out of the woods alive.While there are some stories that had no point to them, Wrong Turn 2: Dead End still has an awesome story over all. The deaths were absolutely cool to see, I know that sounds bad, but I just love a good horror film with the great death scenes. I think the first girl had the best with the ax, but I'm not going to give that scene away, just trust me, it's a very cool one. I was very impressed with how cool this sequel was and I highly recommend this movie for any horror fan, it's a fun one to watch.7/10","7","Smells_Like_Cheese"," A bloody good time!

"5233","Wrong Turn 2: Dead End, the obvious sequel to the Terrific 70s Style Horror film Wrong Turn which starred the beautiful Eliza Dushku and Desmond Harrington (and which I surprisingly really dug and loved), was probably my most anticipated film ever for more than 2 years due to many different reasons, hence I was really looking forward to it and couldn't wait to see it. However, it was taking FOX forever to properly release it, so I waited really long for it to finally come out on October 09th, and well, having finally seen the film, all I can say is - WOW, was the wait worth it!, since the film completely exceeded all my expectations, and turned out to be one of the best Horror Sequels I've seen since Aliens and Evil Dead II. The film revolves around a group of 6 reality show contestants (we have the heroine, the black guy, the army chick, the funny guy, the nice girl, the slut, and the 7th contestant who is very brutally eliminated in the amazing and brutal opening scene of the film), their producer, and the host, who start getting killed off one-by-one while participating in the low-budget reality show by a group of sick, horny, and hideously deformed inbred hillbilly cannibals who plan on making them all their dinner. However, unluckily for the hillbillies, the remaining contestants and the host start fighting back for their survival, unaware that the hillbillies have different plans for them and their body parts.Hvaing watched the film, I have to say that without a doubt one of the biggest highlights of the film is the gorgeous and talented Erica Leerhsen (whom you may recognize from the underrated Blair Witch 2 and the terrific Texas Chainsaw Massacre Remake) who is simply terrific in the movie, and fortunately plays the most interesting and likable character with a saddening back story, and is great to see that she has actually has a decent-sized role as I always thought she was heavily underrated.Henry Rollins steals the show as well and kicks some serious ass in the movie, and let's face it -there's nobody else who would do it better than Rollins; the man is simply a genius and should get more roles like this. Worth mentioning are other talented cast members, including Texas Battle, Aleksa Palladino, Daniella Alonso (who actually has much more to work with than in The Hills Have Eyes II), Steve Braun, Crystal Lowe, and Matthew Currie Holmes, and I have to say that Kimberly Caldwell is also great in her debut role, and delivers a fine performance in the brutal opening scene of the film.Despite that all characters are pretty stereotypical, you actually care for them (which is very rare in Horror movies as most characters in Slasher films are one-dimensional), and I have to admit it is pretty hard to predict who is going to survive or die, thanks to the writers, Turi Meyer and Al Saptien, who have made a surprisingly effective script. There are a few plot holes and cheesy lines here and there, sure, but who cares? The direction is amazing as well. Joe Lynch does an outstanding job as the director, and with his many homages to other movies (including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead II, Aliens, Rambo, The Blair Witch Project; mostly 80s Splatter flicks), and brutal death scenes (hint: opening scene), he is definitely one of the reasons why the sequel turned out so great.And how does Wrong Turn 2 do in comparison with the original? Well, damn great if I may say. Seeing as the original is very serious, eerie, and scary, the sequel tries to be quite the opposite - just a simple, hardcore, highly entertaining, no-brain, and brutal Splatter flick which doesn't take itself seriously, and luckily, it succeeds. It's very different from the first one, and quality-wise - I love them both equally as they're entirely different, but equally amazing. Also, don't let the fact that this is a direct-to-video film put you away, as it's definitely the best straight-to-video movie I've ever seen, and just proves that sometimes even a little, direct-to-video sequel can live up to its proceeder, and even stand on its own.So in all - is Wrong Turn 2 completely flawless? No, not really. Is it a perfect film? Nope. But is it a Highly Entertaining, Fast-paced, Memorable, Gory and Amazing Horror Sequel which blows away most 2007 Horror flicks? Damn straight it is. Honestly, I really don't understand why FOX sent this direct-to-video, and The Hills Have Eyes II in theaters as Wrong Turn 2 is tons better and a much more enjoyable flick.In short, Wrong Turn 2 is hands down the most entertaining and goriest Horror Sequel I've ever seen. It's not flawless or perfect, but I still love it, so if you really are looking for a worthy sequel with amazing acting, great direction, brutal and inventive deaths, likable characters, and lots more, Wrong Turn 2 is definitely then the right turn, and an amazing Horror flick you should surely check out! Highly recommended.8/10","unknown_value_please_contact_support","IAmNo4"," Probably the most entertaining Horror Sequel I've ever seen

"5236","""Wrong Turn 2: Dead End"" is the second movie of the Wrong Turn series and in this one we have a group of reality show contestants who are fighting for their lives because they are hunted from a cannibal family who want to kill them all.I did not like this movie as I liked the first one because this movie did not have the suspense that the first one had and I did not like the plot of this movie. I believe that it was not the sequel that many horror movie fans expected and that's obvious in the ratings of this film.Finally I think that ""Wrong Turn 2: Dead End"" is a simple horror movie with which you can spend your time and nothing more.","4","Thanos_Alfie"," The story about the same but not as good as the first...

"5237","This movie sequel was made because the first in the series was a hit. In this one, once again we meet the mutant, redneck cannibals who live in the sticks and wait with growling stomachs for the next bunch of kids to stumble into their rustic hell-hole. The mutant clan is a little larger in this version, including some mutant horny chicks, and their backwater shanty comes complete with assorted grisly machines and sundry horrors. Into this mix we add Henry Rollins as a misfit marine hired to lead a reality-based TV show and its several amateur entrants into a backwoods survival game. Among this group are the obligatory obnoxious elements, a few babes with repulsive personalities, and one or two heroic types. Maybe this sounds good to you so far, but the plot is so poorly developed that the movie quickly becomes a just another slasher/gore fest which manages to sustain very little tension. Too bad, it was not a bad idea for a sequel, but the writers butchered this flick. Watch it only if you're bored or addicted to the genre.","3","dmuel"," this one sucks

"5238","After four years of anxiously awaiting Wrong Turn 2: Dead End, I was not only incredibly surprised, but it ended up as one of my favorite films ever. Lightyears better than the first movie, Wrong Turn 2 is legions ahead of most movie sequels and is not just intelligent, but nasty, strange, funny, and wholly unpredictable. The whole movie is one non-stop thrill ride, and the ending is simply perfect.So does the movie tie in well with the original? Yes, it definitely does! Besides a few inconsistencies with the two surviving characters from the first film, this sequel brings back two of the cannibals and introduces a vast family of creepy disgusting inbreeding freakshows.And let's talk about scares and gross-out factor. Was this movie incredibly disturbing? You bet your sweet ass it was! The acting was not just amazing for direct-to-video fare, but the directing and cinematography are stunning. For once, we have a highly original plot slightly in the vein of Halloween: Resurrection, but far superior.The characters were all incredibly likable, and I love how there were several scenes that really give you an idea of personalities, character traits, and utilizes fantastic dialogue and some of the best and most creative gore sequences on film.Overall, Wrong Turn 2 is not simply some crappy direct-to-video waste of time--once again, this sequel is so far superior to the original, and a new horror masterpiece. For the horror fan, Wrong Turn 2 absolutely CANNOT be missed.","10","PoisonKeyblade"," By far the best DTV movie EVER!

"5240","The set-up for Wrong Turn 2 is pretty awful: a production team (consisting of three seemingly inexperienced twenty somethings and a presenter) take a small group of hopeful contestants into the wilds to film a survivalist reality TV series. Here they become victims to a bloodthirsty family of cannibalistic hillbillies.Now I'm no expert on the finer points of making TV programmes, but just four people on the crew of a complex reality show?!?! Gimme a break!Fortunately, the silly initial premise doesn't get in the way of this film ultimately becoming an extremely enjoyable (and very gory) film, and kudos must go to director Joe Lynch for making this sequel to the 2003 original such a fun ride.Amongst a cast of relative unknowns (horror fans may recognise some faces, but your average film-goer won't), Henry Rollins obviously stands out, as the ex-soldier turned show host who uses his military experience to turn the tables on his attackers. But the REAL star of the show is the brilliant array of splattery special effects that regularly paint the screen red. Copious blood and gore is definitely the order of the day.Lynch starts as he means to go on, opening with a gruesome OTT death scene which sees a pretty blonde cut vertically in half with an axe, her guts spilling messily onto the floor. Gorehounds will have a field day! And so it continues, with plenty of messy death scenes, a smattering of female nudity, and even a touch of incestuous mutant sex thrown in for good measure. You can't say that this one doesn't try to be a crowd pleaser!Also rather welcome is a nice sense of unpredictability: early on, I thought I had pretty much figured out who would survive the ordeal and who would end up in the cannibals' hotpot. However, after one particularly unexpected death, it becomes evident that the makers are out to screw with viewers preconceptions. It's a nice move that works well.Wrong Turn 2 isn't a great film, but it is a good one, and I recommend it to all fans of backwoods horror flicks.","7","BA_Harrison"," Reality show contestants vs. hillbilly cannibals.

"5241","A group of reality show contestants and the show's producers find themselves fighting for their own survival against hideously deformed cannibal hillbillies who plan on making them all their dinner. Yes, this is the plot of Wrong Turn 2. However, believe it or not, the whole reality show sub-plot is actually better than it sounds, and thanks to the clever writers, it vanishes 30 minutes into the movie. Speaking of which, I have to say I was pretty satisfied with the end result since Wrong Turn 2 to my surprise turned out to be the best horror flick of 2007 I've seen. Think that's not saying much since 28 Weeks Later and Grindhouse were the only solid releases? Well, ahm, for a little direct-to-video flick that surpasses all expectations one might have - that's really, really good. Not saying that this is the best genre offering since Halloween, but as an enjoyable, pure fun and gory Slasher film, the flick just delivers. Have to say I was impressed with Mr Lynch's direction as well, since this was unbelievably his first ever motion picture project. The cast is also truly impressing for a DTV title; Rollins kicks ass as always (and sadly gets his ass kicked), the Palladino girl is even better than in Sidney Lumet's films, and once more Erica Leerhsen impresses even more and shows how very underrated she is, the woman should get more roles. The kills are effective and simple, the story ridiculous and enjoyable, and the flick is pure fun. Not brainy, not serious, just some great Slasher fun.Worth your money.","10","goofy-marick"," Best horror flick of 2007

"5243","So cool that Henry Rollins is in it and he was nothing but cool in the whole flick. Every time he was on the screen it was the right movie.Rollins plays the host of a stupid looking reality show were the contestants pretend they must survive a post-apocalyptic world, but they soon discover how real that scenario is, as they end up taping the show in the same woods as a group of psychopathic killers. In this film, somewhat of an origin story is given to the inbreed family that does the slashing in the woods, but I have to say, the group that did the killing in the first film were far more better. Just a little bit more creepy and creative in Wrong Turn. In Wrong Turn 2, it seem they were trying to up the extreme of these characters when it was not needed.By itself it's more of a Stereotypical horror film with elements of Predator-like action, thanks mostly to Rollins. As a franchise, while the original brought freshness to the genre, it's sequel was stale.","6","subxerogravity"," On it's own it's an OK horror flick, but not as impressive as it's original.

"5244","Wrong Turn 2: Dead End (the 'R' in Turn is actually written backwards on the opening credits not that it matters much...) is set in Greenbrier Back County in West Virginia where a new reality show called 'Active Survivors' is being staged, six contestants are there to survive the tasks & maybe win $100,000. The six contestants are paired up, it's Nina (Erica Leerhsen) & Mara (Aleksa Palladino), Jake (Texas Battle(!)) & Elena (Crystal Lowe) while Amber (Daniella Alonso) is stuck with Jonsey (Steve Braun) all of whose first task is to find food. Tracked throughout the playing area by hidden cameras they discover finding food isn't as easy as it first sounds, their problems increase even further when a bunch of inbred cannibals decide they want to eat all the contestants & production team. Stranded miles from the nearest town & unable to contact anyone the contestants must fight back in a real life game of survival or become cannibal food...This American Canadian co-production was directed by Joe Lynch & one has to say for what it was Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is a throughly enjoyable & pleasingly gory horror thriller, a direct to video/DVD sequel to Wrong Turn (2003) one has to say I didn't have high hopes for it as cheap sequels to horror flicks usually aren't very good & ones that go straight to video/DVD are even more likely to suck. To be fair both Wrong Turn films rip-off other films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Deliverance (1973) & just about any other slasher film you care to mention & by all rights both should be crap but surprisingly neither are. The script by Turi Meyer & Al Septien does exactly what it sets out to do, it's a straight forward backwoods slasher flick with loads of over-the-top gore & violence. Call me easily pleased but I loved the gore in this film, call me slightly sick but I loved the level of violence & the films intention to deliver lots of blood soaked set-pieces is, in my opinion, highly commendable. Some unenlightened viewers may say the film is full of pointless gore, well as far as I'm concerned there's no such thing as pointless gore! The character's are alright, I must admit I liked the army veteran Dale as he turns the tables on the cannibals & turns them from being the hunters to the hunted & I also liked the main heroine Nina as I thought she had a bit about her, she was vulnerable when she needed to be yet strong when it comes down to it. At only 90 odd minutes in length the film moves along like a rocket, your never far from the next blood soaked killing & the climax literally paints the screen red with blood, imagine a slaughterhouse but instead of cattle insert human beings. I even liked the ending which points to a sequel & features green toxic waste & an ugly mutant baby!Director Lynch does a good job, he has chosen to do away with the suspense, tension & atmosphere & goes for all out gore which I for one won't be complaining about. I love gory films, the nastier & bloodier the better & Wrong Turn 2: Dead End doesn't disappoint, people are chopped vertically in half with axes, people have arrows shot into their eyeballs, people minced up in huge machines, there are cannibal scenes, someone gets their throat ripped out & an absolute fountain of blood gushes everywhere, someone has barb wire wrapped around their wrists, , people are graphically blown to pieces with dynamite, axes in heads, someone has their back hacked away, there's plenty of intestines, body parts, decapitated heads, brains, offal, gallons of blood, bodily parts & severed limbs & much more. There's also a gross scene when the cannibals force Nina to eat some meat & there's little bits all round her mouth as she can't wipe it off which looks pretty disgusting. Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is a gore hounds wet dream, I guess I'm going to have to change my bedsheets tomorrow... I'm not sure if this is available in an 'R' rated & 'Unrated' editions but if it is you know which one you should go for & if you don't go & sit in the corner on your own until you do!With a supposed budget of about $4,000,000 this actually had a pretty decent amount of money spent on it, apparently shot in 25 days in Vancouver in British Columbia in Canada this has good production values & is well made. The special effects are good with a mixture between good old fashioned latex, rubber & fake blood along with some decent CGI computer effects. The acting is OK, I particularly liked Leershen the heroine who has a great way of looking surprised & is also very easy on the eyes. By the way, why would anyone call their child Texas Battle?Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is a great horror flick which doesn't even try to be deep or meaningful & the whole reality TV show setting is more of a plot device to get people out into the open rather than a deliberate thing which to satirise or make fun of. For what Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is this is fantastic & it also has some of the best gore scenes I've seen in ages as well which help.","8","poolandrews"," Outrageously gory sequel, probably the best straight-to-video/DVD sequel ever in fact.

"5245","Here's the plot: Hillbilly Cannibals attack reality TV show crew and contestants. Gore and nice make-up follow, but also pretty cliché and weak characters, average acting, bland dialogue and some boring scenes. But if you liked the first, this should be still up your alley.WT2 is pretty much a rehash of the first, and if you're a fan of the first, then you should be pretty happy with the results from the second. I didn't enjoy the first, cause I thought the acting/dialogue was pure grade A crap. The same thing applies here unfortunately. Even more so actually. Though the thing that made Wrong Turn one worth-watching was the hillbilly cannibals and the gore. And like I said above, some cool gore and make-up effects are the winning parts of this film as well.I suppose Wrong Turn 2 is a perfect follow up to the original. It's almost exactly the same. Though unfortunately to all the Doucheq fans out there, she's not in it. Though there is another hot chick and this one actually shows some boobs. So that's a plus. But unfortunately the downsides of the flick are a little too much. Maybe with Wrong Turn 3 or 4 or maybe even 5, they'll get it right and really go for some real suspense and maybe even cast some actors with experience.

There is about a gas stations worth of blood involved and few hundred feet of intestine.However some of the effects are bad and unbelievable, so therefore all in all i would have to say this and the hills have eyes 2 are simply terrible sequel's and i can only warn you to avoid them both.","3","godzilladom"," bad acting, bad script, simply bad

"5253","A group of young adults is invited to the cast of a ""Survivor""-style show, filmed in the same woods from ""Wrong Turn"" in West Virginia. Apparently, the producers didn't bother to check the location out very well in advance because those crazy inbred rednecks are still living here and hungry for young, lean human flesh.Director Joe Lynch and the writers of Carrot Top's masterpiece ""Chairman of the Board"" bring us a surprisingly good film. While most straight-to-video sequels are lacking in many ways, this one shines forth with originality and vision. Lynch's previous work was in the world of music videos, and he transitions very well to the horror style. The fact this film has a reality TV element to it may help, but those are not the film's strongest parts.We're treated to a woman who is literally chopped in half (vertically) by an ax, a scene of an inbred mutant masturbating... and plenty of cannibalism. While the worst thing I can say is that the Morlocks were not the most believable as real human beings, if we can look pas that (it's horror, you know) then the movie really kicks you in the nuts (or ovaries).The lovely Erica Leerhsen takes the lead as Nina, Henry Rollins is awesome as the survivalist Dale (a much more natural role than he had in ""Feast"" and a significantly bigger part, as well). I was happy to see Daniella Alonso playing the militant lesbian Amber. Alonso had recently appeared in two very awful films (""Hood of Horrors"" and ""Hills Have Eyes 2"" -- see separate reviews) and it was good to see her in something where she's given a chance to really act.Speaking of ""Hills 2"", this film is often compared to it. They're both Fox films released in 2007 as sequels to films about mutants who attack people in the wilderness. Well, let me set the record straight here: ""Wrong Turn 2"" deserved a theatrical release and ""Hills 2"" deserved to be straight-to-video (or never made at all). This was a big mistake on the part of Fox. In every category ""Wrong Turn 2"" is superior -- acting, plot, gore, nudity, humor and action.I am unsure how I felt about Crystal Lowe, playing the woman with loose morals named Elena. Sure, she was hot and it's always good to get excessive nudity and sex in a horror film (gratuitous sex and violence sells). But Lowe needs to start moving into more solid acting. She's becoming a name and it's more from her body than anything else. Maybe that's all she wants -- fame is fame -- but I suspect if she wants a long-term movie career, it would be best to move into non-sexy roles soon. Don't get me wrong, though -- I'll keep watching her either way.Kimberly Caldwell (""American Idol"") played herself and was amazing. Probably the best acting from a musician since Meat Loaf in ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"". Ken Kirzinger (the new Jason Voorhees) shows up, too, but unfortunately he plays yet another character where he is unrecognizable.If you liked the first film, check this one out. Joe Lynch is poised to jump from novice to veteran in the world of horror if he wants it -- this is precisely the sort of film that gets noticed by the fans. I loved it, and I think you will, too. Don't rent that lame ""Hills 2"" when you can get the real deal with ""Wrong Turn 2"".","7","gavin6942"," A Blood-Drenched Epic From Horror Master Joe Lynch

The gory part may be disturbing for some people, but the action makes the whole movie. Wrong Turn 2 kills off all the stereotypes, final girls. It's different, brilliant. The whole suspense is based on the surviving of the characters. You think that Mara, the shy supposed protagonist girl will survive but NO she ends axed in the head at the first 1/4 of the movie, while Nina, the goth, bitchy girl survives, along with Jake, the black jock. I really want to make the point on the action. Fight, blood, suspense, you got it. The inbreeds pops out of no-where, anywhere and whenever. The characters are well developed, all with different personalities. For a sequel, well, the only things we get back from Wrong Turn 2003 are Three-Fingers, more insane than ever and the old timer.

Here is a movie that is so sick and cynical in its relentless violence and torture scenes, that it led me to the hearts of the filmmakers. Why was this movie even made?! The characters are, more or less, the usual set of teenagers we've seen in countless other horror movies, from the jock, the womanizer, the ""odd girl"" who could care less, and the spoiled brat.

Some have a plot, some don't, and of course, there are ones that about as bad as this one. The original film, while not a great one, was at least atmospheric and suspenseful. Wrong Turn 2, on the other hand, is 90 minutes of teenagers being introduced and then being stabbed, tortured impaled, chopped up, and mutilated. It's like watching a film written by a perverted scriptwriter. That's all this movie is. It is just mindless, bloody violence.

Than the movie turns to a bit better to be honest, it even has a few good lines. Next the slaughter began, and the movie was going a bit clumsy, some good, some bad, but watchable, even on moments inventive and entertaining. During this ""improved"" period I became more and more aware of the B-production and really bad acting excluding Henry Rollins who did a good job. While the movie was slowly turning a bit repetitive and boring with every next scene, I feel the director tear the screenplay in pieces and burned them, and start to pour everywhere He manages extra fake blood, guts, livers, hearts and all the organs you can think off, I think He even probably borrowed or stole from somewhere extra fakes.I mean how much blood and guts can one man or woman have, that combined with the unbearable bad acting and now already with ridiculous lines, goofs, lack of direction or logic, became funny, I started to laugh out loud while the pieces of people were all around, I laughed to the director and people who praised this garbage.","1","dejan8378"," I laughed

All the characters are clichés with nearly no acting talent, I'm talking HS student level acting here ROTFL. The inbred hillbillies aren't nearly as scary as in the first one...they try to make them kind of comical. The gore was pretty cheesy, like something you might see in a Sci-Fi channel original. Even the cinematography in this one is much cheaper/lower budget, giving it that made for TV feel.","1","IzzyNoya"," Not nearly the scary feel of the first...

"5261","The first Wrong Turn was scary & relentless and the second was reasonable. As usual the filmmakers tried to make the sequel better by adding a maximum amount of blood, guts, gore and violence that reduced the scares and thrills but it wasn't all bad. Wrong Turn 2: Dead End wasn't the best horror movie ever but it's not even the worst because the movie doe's have enough to keep you entertained and the death scenes were very creative especially at the start when the girl was cut in half vertically. There were some scenes that might have made me vomit if I was eating when the freaky mother was giving birth to an unadorable & extremely ugly baby. The other scene was when the freaky family was forcing the girl to eat the human meat near the end. Dale the retired solider shouldn't of died because he was the hero of the picture and his death ruined the whole movie for me. The ending just made me laugh when the stupid looking baby was given a severed finger to suck.","6","springsunnywinter"," More blood and guts than the first

Cheap. Childish. Stupid. Not fun as old school cheap B-movies. Internet-ish. Lame.If you're 10-12 years old, you may find some sense in the script. Yes, the first Wrong Turn was pretty lame but still relatively watchable. It had suspense, it had some old-school B moments in it.But hey, this second piece is beyond your worst expextations. I fell asleep several times while watching it and I owe it to my girlfriend's laughter that I woke up for the final moments and actually saw the ending.A piece of trash for sure and definitely NOT the kind of enjoyable trash B-movie we all expected from this one.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","vladdich"," Trash can, anyone?

"5265","I rented 'Wrong Turn 1 & 2' a couple of nights ago as I am a huge fan of horror films, and I thought that it wouldn't hurt to watch this even though I didn't know anything about the films. I liked the first one, so I continued to watch the second movie. I definitely thought that the second film would be trash compared to the first, as it is kind of how sequels in horror films generally are. Boy, was I wrong! 'Wrong Turn 2: Dead End' has gratuitous amount of blood and entertainment. It is fun and gory and definitely a sequel which is better than its predecessor. Also, you don't even have to know anything about the first film to get it. Now, that is a bonus which many sequels don't have.A group is about to film a survival TV series in the middle of the woods of West Virginia. The show is called 'Apocalypse' where they have to think that the world as they knew it has ended and they are the only survivors and whoever wins will take home 100,000$. Things take a wrong turn for the worst when the contestants are attacked by the hillbilly monster cannibals who survive by eating humans, as the chemical waste has destroyed all the wildlife. So, now the contestants are really trying to save their skins from becoming dinner for the monster family.The monster family reminds of some film or show I saw back when I was in school, I just can't place my finger on what it was. But, that is very haunting and eerie for me. Anyway, the acting overall was good and the screenplay is exciting, awesome and captures your full attention. I was so impressed with how cool this sequel was and this is a film which won't let your hopes down. The monsters from the first movie (whom I thought were dead and only had 3 monsters in total) now actually have a large family, which also has a teenager who drops his pants to get down to business when he sees a hot girl. Also, they have women who give birth to horrible monstrous disfigured babies. This film gave us a kind of understanding of their world and why they hunted people. The performance by the colonel was also great and this set-up gave more authenticity to some of the things the characters did. All the actors did such a great job that I didn't feel like I was watching a movie and all of this was fake. Giving more screen time to the monsters was a good idea and the climax is also very believable. I hope they make the third movie soon (hopefully it will be as entertaining as this) and I pray no monsters come to get me when I am going in to the woods. :) 8/10","8","GirishGowda"," Who Wants To Spend A Day With The West Virginia Monsters?

"5266","I saw the first ""Wrong Turn"" its opening weekend in theaters back in 2003. It was a very entertaining and fast-paced (granted it was only 81 minutes long) thrill-ride that rarely let up until the credits rolled. I wanted to see a sequel all along, but a Direct-to-DVD one wasn't what I had in mind. So, yeah, when I heard about this being a Direct-to-DVD sequel with a plot about reality show contestants no less, I was expecting it to be entertaining crap at best. But once the movie was wrapped and people were able to see screenings of it, surprisingly positive things were actually being said about it. Some were even saying it was better than the original. How could that be? Were these people that just didn't like the original and found it easy to surpass? I didn't see how a Direct-to-DVD sequel with a plot I wasn't very thrilled about could manage the feat of being better than the first. But after reading mostly encouraging reviews for it I began to think that maybe this really would be good.Were the reviews right or were my fears realized? Well, I must say I'm very happy to report that this was a shockingly good sequel with the quality of a theatrical release. It really did deserve to be released in theaters. After a killer opening with a nice death scene the movie does slow down a bit to set-up the storyline with the reality show contestants, but soon after it gets going and is an exciting, gore-filled time. I was really impressed. This is actually a very worthy follow-up to the first movie and in some ways it actually surpasses it. I'm kind of surprised they even managed to make this movie for as cheap as they did. If this cost only 4 Million then where the hell did the almost 13 Million spent on the original go? I sure can't figure it out.I'm not too sure what to say about the actual movie. This is one where I really don't have many comments about the events in it. I just had a really good time and I enjoyed Erica Leerhsen (Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre  2003) in it. Her character, Nina, was my favorite and the most interesting. Aside from her character, the only others I liked were Amber, Mara, Jake, and especially Dale (played by Henry Rollins in a pretty cool role).The major problem I have with most of the endless line of Direct-to-DVD sequels being released is that the majority of them just copy the plots from the previous films. Some even annoyingly feature the exact same type of scenes that were in the original, with the exact same thing happening to another character. Thankfully ""Wrong Turn 2"" is none of this. This is a perfect example of a Direct-to-DVD sequel with its own idea. I wish the quality of others could be this good.Since this is going to be a profitable title for Fox you can bet we'll see a third entry sometime in the future. But advice to them; keep the same writer and director. Such an impressive job was done with this one that bringing in someone else could just screw up what is so far an enjoyable series. I will be disappointed if the next one has all new filmmakers. I trust that with them and another new plot (one different than the previous two) they will deliver another winner.Grade: 8/10 (B+)","8","groovymike_16"," A Direct-to-DVD sequel with the quality of a theatrical release...

"5267","Forget about saw and hostel movies, wrong turn 2 is completely depraved, sick, gory as all hell and has enough unpredictable turns to make it a must see for all horror fans. The hillbilly's are trulyspectacularly deranged and are exactly what I would imagine some of the inbred ferals to look like if they were poisoned with deformation chemicals! The gore in this movie is superb if your into that stuff. You have an arrow through to heads and through the eye of the other. An axe going straight down he middle of a cute blonde and her intestines left on the ground. A scene with a girl face down in a stream being slashed behind by a hillbilly until her back bone is visible. And on and on and on, a great mix of disgusting gore. Although, I must admit I enjoyed the first wrong turn more than this, purely because it was more suspenseful and less gory, but this one I think they made especial attention to the gore o meter. ALl the talk is about the likes of saw and hostel, devils rejects etc. but this movie is sick to the mother effing bone with some of the nastiest kills I've seen in some time.

"5270","I always found the original 2002 film 'Wrong Turn' to be a modest backwoods slasher item, and this straight-to-DVD sequel doesn't add anything particularly new other than more blood, gore, perversion and mutilation to the survival trek. Nice! Now that opening death scene has guts literally and shows what your really in for. Director Joe Lynch cooks up rollicking jolts and an over-the-top attitude that lends well with the films mock send-up of a reality TV show about the apocalypse, where is has contestants competing for 1 million dollars by trying to survive in a remote West Virginia. The characters don't really set themselves apart from your usual clichéd victim, but here the deformed hillbillies happen to be part of a family. Children and parents sharing their love for bloody pulp! Even a back-story is thrown right in. However due to its concentration of thinking up new twisted ways to shorten the cast, the pacing can drag before the next nasty surprise surfacers. I didn't find the material to be overly predictable, but it never went away from its stereotypical format. The camera has that rapid style, and the music score packs a ominous charge. Performances won't win any awards, but are commendable enough. Henry Rollins superbly commands the screen, and Erica Leerhsen leads the way with a fine turn. For me this is what ""The Hills Have Eyes 2 (2007)"" wanted to be, but fell way short. Nothing grand, but an absurdly fun and in-your-face horror romp. I guess this is what it wanted to be, and true to that it is.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","lost-in-limbo"," Blood soaked soap opera.

"5272","To start this, I would like to say that this movie cheered me up, made me grab my mouth and cracked me up while still being scared.Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is a movie I highly recommend for a ""Slasher"" fan. It delivers all we want; The bitchy goth chick (Erica Leershen - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake), the token black guy (Texas Battle - Final Destination 3), the tough army girl (Daniella Alonso - The Hills Have Eyes 2, the slutty bitch (Crystal Lowe - Black Christmas remake)the joker (Steve Braun - Harold and Kumar go to White Castle), the diva celebrity as herself (Kimberly Caldwell - TV's American Idol), plane Jane, boyfriend the cameraman and the lovely, angry but fun previous soldier who's now hosting 'Reality TV' (Henry Rollins - Feast). We can say that the stereotypes are cliché but they actually work and fit perfectly.Little can I say but the inbred cannibals were amazing, and not to mention brutal. They were this family just like us humans but only way more brutal, disgusting and uglier. Although they did not top the original inbreds but at least we got the survivor from the original Wrong Turn, Three Finger, to hunt more fresh meat.Cut to the directing. I couldn't believe that this movie was Joe Lynch's first. The directing was very good and did not seem first-time directing. I loved how he gave every important character their screen time to kind of root to them. However, his sick little twisted mind really helped the film making it more violent, brutal and disturbing.For every horror fans out there, do not judge the film for it's cheesy trailer or knowing it is a Direct to Video release because it is hell of an action-packed blood-splatter horror flick! (As for a DTV release, this is highly one of the Best ones yet and the best horror sequel in a long time)So bring on Wrong Turn 3, and let Lynch be the director. He did a fantastic job on this one, I count on him doing the same for a third installment.It gets 8 Stars out of 10 for being one hell of a slasher flick and for making a bloody right turn!","8","alternate-dan"," Wrong Turn 2 makes a Bloody Right Turn

"5274","Every now and then, a sequel comes out that makes you proud to be a horror fan. This is that time. From first time director Joe Lynch comes Wrong Turn 2: Dead End, the best direct to video film in quite a long time. Plot: Contenstants in a survival reality show find their skills put to the ultimate test when they come upon a pack of mutated, inbred cannibals who are very, very hungry. Highlights: Henry Rollins gets the role fans have been ready for him to play forever as Dale Murphy, a Rambo for the new generation. The body count is terrific (one of the flaws of the original was the low body count) as blood, guts, and other unmentionable objects fly across the screen in a litany of grue and terror that should make any horror fan weep. Genre veterans Erica Leehrsen (Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003) and Texas Battle (Final Destination 3) also bring their A-game. Lowpoints: Should have replaced Hills Have Eyes 2 in the theaters, because as a straight to video sequel, it could lose a share of their audience.

Plenty of gore, nudity, and suspense on display here.","9","mattressman_pdl"," Say hello to the missus for me

"5277","Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is the sequel to the surprisingly successful first instalment released four years prior. The idea is still the same as the film follows a group of reality show contestants and organizers who get tracked down by inbred cannibals in the wilderness of West Virginia.The movie starts on a rather low note since the characters involved are particularly unlikable. Some examples include a former military who shows his muscles but not much brainpower, a misogynistic loser who constantly makes dirty jokes and a superficial woman willing to give blowjobs in exchange for screen time. The first half hour is rather difficult to sit through.However, the movie gets much better once the horror elements kick in. The surviving characters start getting more fleshed out and become more likable as well. The death and torture scenes are very brutal, even by the genre's standards and the rather modest budget. Especially the final scenes at an abandoned mill deep in the forest are among the franchise's greatest moments. The film also offers some background information on the inbred cannibals as several characters from the first film make an appearance again. It's interesting that the cannibals are presented as a loyal family with strong ties in this instalment rather than just as creepy hillbillies as in the first film. The movie even has an environmental message that explains the villains' atrocious malformations. The film's final scene is particularly ugly and memorable in that regard. The film's final hour gets better with every minute and will keep you on the edge of your seat.In the end, Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is one of the few cases in cinematic history when a sequel is much better than the original film. Don't get fooled by the shallow opening thirty minutes that make you expect the worst. Once the introductions to all the characters are done, the film quickens up the pace as the death scenes are much more brutal than those of the predecessor and the plot is less predictable and even shares some interesting background information and an environmental message. Fans of bloody slashers should certainly watch and appreciate this film and might want to check out the entire franchise for that matter.","8","kluseba"," Blood Is Thicker Than Water

"5279","Hey! What would be a better setting for a new Reality survival series than the heavy backwoods of West Virginia where the original Hillbilly cannibals from the first film killed everything in sight? A film crew and their actor contestants make this fatal choice and more hillbilly cannibals show up and kill them off. From the opening scene, which has blond Hollywood contestant Kimberly (Kimberly Caldwell) being literally split in half down the middle; Director Joe Lynch sets out to make this sequel a gore fest that out does the original. Lynch does achieve his sick out goal of out doing the original in gore but he fails to deliver a superior film. The original ""Wrong Turn"" has some stomach turning moments for sure, but it also delivered great suspense, and some classic jump scares. The film also provided some characters that the audience liked and could pull for. This film offers Herny Rollins as an ex-military man doing his Rambo impersonation while the hapless actors and crew get easily killed and picked apart by the hillbillies. It takes a while, but eventually the audience can get behind the characters of Nina (Leerhsen) and Jake (Battle) and that helps a bit since most of the characters here are very stereotyped. The acting and production value are good and the film looks good. Where Wrong Turn 2 makes its wrong turn is in its over the top attempt to gross out the audience. Yes it's a horror film, but the excessive gore becomes the entire point of the film and takes away from any true terror the film can manufacture. It's hard to tell if it's intentional or not, but there is a dining room scene the echoes the original ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Nina is being force fed human remains in a tasteless scene that is hard to watch. This isn't scary, just disgusting. The filmmakers here would have benefited by watching Tobe Hooper's Texas diner scene and realize that what made it so terrifying was its style, editing and suggestion. Wrong Turn 2 would have been a better film with some subtlety.","5","loomis78-815-989034"," Subtlety? What does that mean this film asks.

"5280","Normally I stay away from straight to DVD movies, especially sequels because they are usually terrible and cheap looking and awful acting. But when I came across ""Wrong Turn 2"" I was actually eager to see it, as I really liked the first one and I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. They really upped the ante with this one, we get more deaths and more splatter which I really enjoyed. The storyline in this one, we get a group of people filming a reality show which was rather fun and interesting, and I could tell from the opening death a woman sliced in half is that this movie was gonna be awesome. I was a bit sceptical at the reality show setting as in the past when slasher movies have tried this, they usually don't really work, but in this it works to full effect and plus we get more inbred mutants to add to the fun. But there are a few drawbacks in this movie, like firstly it does lack the tension and atmosphere the first movie had and instead opting for more blood splatter and gore, and the fact that we see way too much of the mutants which did take away the overall terror and this movie was still fun and slick.The acting in this was actually not what I expected, it was really good. Henry Rollins was fun as the ex-marine turning Rambo without being ridiculous. Erica Leerhsen really gives it her all and comes across as one of the more fleshed out characters in this movie and Texas Battle also really stood out and believable as he turns hero throughout the latter half of the movie. Daniella Alonso also gives a stand out performance as the female army soldier. Steve Braun plays the joker of pack pretty well, Crystal Lowe was gorgeous playing the token slutty character but she played the part really well and I also enjoyed her in the (Black X-Mas remake), Aleksa Palladino made me really feel for her as the put upon plain girl whose treated like dirt and I felt sad when her time ended as she didn't get the opportunity to get her own back and Matthew Currie Holmes was extremely unlikeable and self absorbed but he did it well.All in all ""Wrong Turn 2"" is fun fast paced and slick all the right ingredients for a sequel, it's a pity that the further sequels doesn't follow suit.","7","acidburn-10"," Good for a Straight To DVD sequel

"5282","This film is definitely more successful than the first one. This film is full of horror, suspense and a great thriller to watch. The story is very well written, and the events within it are ordered in a professional manner. The film revolves around a TV show, which is situated in the woods. Straight from the beginning, as soon as you see the woods, you can tell something thrilling is to come. The TV show turns into a race to escape the cannibals - but only those still alive.This film could easily compare to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""My Bloody Valentine"". These films are not exactly the same, but the plots and characteristics are common in each individual film.I thought the film was fantastic to a point, before it started going slightly downhill. We have all seen different variables of genetically deformed cannibals before, but this film managed to keep me entertained right through, from start to end. It has more gore than the previous one, and of course this 4 year advancement gives the film better effects, making it exciting.

"5284","Wrong Turn was a pretty original and interesting film back from 2003 which starred the lovely Desmond Harrington and the even lovelier Eliza Dushku, and was about a group of people who start getting killed-of by a group of hillbilly mutants in a very gross way. Wrong Turn 2 takes the premise a lot further and centers around 6 (would've been 7 if a blond girl wasn't brutally killed in the opening scene) interesting reality show contestants who are all trying to win a certain sum of money, but soon they get killed of by the hillbillies again. We have the bitchy, likable heroine (the gorgeous and talented Erica Leerhsen), ex-jock (Texas Battle), likable producer (Aleksa Palladino), skater boy (Steve Braun), gay army girl (Daniella Alonso) and the... um slut (Crystal Lowe). Now these characters are all stereotypical, yet you feel bad for them when they die, and they die in such funny and gory, scary moments you just have to like this film! I really liked this sequel (more than the first) and I thought the family was very scary and greatly done. The acting was great too and all actors do a good job here (yes, even the slut), but I thought Erica Leerhsen was the best actor in the movie and despite her character isn't a typical heroine, you want to see her live. The director did a really good job too and the deaths are really effective as I already said, so I think if you love scary, bloody horror films, Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is the best movie you could ever choose.

"5285","I really enjoyed the first movie. When watching this, I thought what a waste of film. The first 5 minutes I said to myself ""I'm in for a bad film"" I was felt like I was right.The plot just went over the same thing over again. The acting was laughable and appalling. Most of the characters, you just end up hating with no connection.The make up scenes , you could easily tell that they are fake. The gore went way over the top and was ridiculous. How could one single blow to the head with an axe chop all of you in half. How could slashing someone's back a couple of times show the spine, seriously it's that bad.I thought there were too many inbred scenes and two incest scenes which I thought was unnecessary. I thought to myself ""I really didn't need to see that"".Some of the filming looked like a filming mistake but felt like to add it in anyway which was rubbish. There were shots that were blurred and you couldn't tell what was going on.I recommend you the first one. I would really avoid this to save money and time.","1","movieman89-2"," Wrong Turn 2 the gutter

"5286","The best direct-to-DVD franchise movie ever? I'd say so. With the new trend of releasing sequels straight to DVD (I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer, Return to House on Haunted Hill), Wrong Turn 2 surpasses all my expectations. It has interesting characters, loads of suspense, and great death scenes. Despite the low budget, the film even manages to better the first film.Don't get me wrong, the film has its faults but they can easily be overlooked when a movie, which with its budget shouldn't be good, turns out to be one of the best horror films of 2007.Definitely worth renting.","8","film_maniac2500"," Violent - Unpredictable - Suspenseful

"5287","This movie is really a great horror movie. I've never seen such a scary movie before. Its very entertaining movie as well unlike the boring supernatural horror movies which are not really scary. I enjoyed each and every scene of it. This sequel is the most violent one in the entire wrong turn series. Its totally my type of movie because i love those horror movies which make me scary. Amazing direction by Joe Lynch. All the characters were really very good. Much better than my expectations. Overall its an excellent movie, very very very violent. Strongly recommended for the lovers of horror movies. P.S. Don't watch it if you have a weak heart.","10","laraibkhan-29129"," The Scariest movie ever made !!!

"5288","This movie was pretty good and i liked it,i found it just as good as the original film and just as entertaining. This film may not be as serious or as dark as the original film but it still works very well because like the original you have some likable characters and a great location and some good cinematography and you also get some suspenseful scenes that work very well. now granted not all of the characters are likable you do get your cliché characters like the rude girl and the cheating boyfriend type,but most of the characters were likable.I liked Hennry Rollins in the film i thought he was a Badass and he was fun to watch,and if people are a fan of the guy then i would definitely recommend you to watch this film because Hennry Rollins kicks a lot of ass in this film and beats up a lot of The hillbillies. What i also liked about this film was that it was unpredictable because you didn't know who would live and who would die and that made the film different and more exciting because you never saw anything coming,maybe you think you do but then the complete opposite happens and you get a big surprise and thats another reason i'm giving this film some praise because the people who i thought would die lived and the people i thought would live died and it was very surprising.This film has a lot of twists and turns and it had some good ideas and creativity which i liked and i liked the idea of the simulated post apocalyptic reality show that the characters were involved in i thought it was a fun idea and it made the film different which is a good thing in a horror movie and that's why this film worked because the formula changed a little bit because of certain things like the ""unpredictability"" and the twists and turns and of course the cool idea of the simulated reality show. of course things go wrong and people end up getting killed one by one just like the previous film but here it was done differently and some of the kills were quite creative and very Gory so if people are gore fans they might like this film.I thought three finger was one creepy son of a Bitch in this film! he was just as creepy here as he was in the first film and i thought the actor that played three finger did a really good Job, and for some reason i've always found him the creepiest out of all the cannibals i don't know why but there is just something freakish and weird about him that makes him stand out from the others. I thought the make up effects of the cannibal hillbillies looked very good and they all looked very menacing and scary.As for the characters in the film i have to say there were a lot of them i liked which surprised me because usually most horror films don't have many likable characters in them but this did.I liked Erica Leerhsen in the film i thought she was very pretty and i think she's quite a good Actress she certainly did well in this film. I will admit that i was a bit off about her character at first because she seemed a bit distant and moody toward everyone but as the film went on her character Grew on me and i did end up liking her. I also liked the friendship she formed with Texas Battle Who's characters name is Jake,i thought he also did good in the film i thought he played his role well and i thought his acting was above average. I also liked Steve Braun and Daniella Alonso in the film i thought those two were very likable and i found them both very funny at times.their characters made me laugh my head off! and i loved their back and forth Dialog with each other and i liked the friendship that developed with them because at first they didn't really like each other but then they ended up getting along which i thought was nice and another reason i liked their characters was they helped each other out,they didn't just leave each other so when the guy got caught in a trap in the woods the girl tried to help him,she was a true (friend) to him she didn't just run away and leave him she stayed with him and tried to (help) him and that made her character likable and these are the kind of characters i like in a movie, characters that (help each other) not characters that are A**holes and don't care about anyone.that's why this film works because nearly everyone is likable.I also liked Aleksa Palladino in the film i thought her acting was good and i thought her character was sweet and quite nice.so six of the characters i liked but the others did nothing for me and i didn't really care about them. maybe if the others were written better i would have found them more intriguing but there were a total of six characters i liked and thought did good in their acting and as i said before Hennry Rollins kicks ass! and that reason alone is good enough to watch this film!.you get good action good blood and gore and good kills and the film never gets boring because it has so much action and i liked our two lead actors Texas and Erica i thought they played good and interesting Characters and i liked the rolls they played and the film also had a great unexpected final which i enjoyed and thought was intense. All in all this is a Very good film and its worth buying!.","10","Sci-FiHorrorFan"," A Great sequel!.

"5289","First of all I LOVE the Wrong Turn trilogy. The original was a very decent slasher movie. However Wrong Turn 2 goes waaaaaaayyyyyyyy over the top. The gore and blood effects are so ridiculously stupid. Even worse the movie takes place during the daytime. You can't make a horror movie scary without it taking place at night. I know its been done before, but Wrong Turn 2 doing that. It does NOT work. The thing I hated the most was there were moments where the mutants engaged in ""sexual activity"". That was extremely gross and sick. I wish those parts were deleted. Now don't get me wrong this movie was fun to watch. The acting is great and and there were a few surprises. The only cool thing about Wrong Turn 2 is watching Henry Rollins as retired marine Dale Murphy kicking mutant ass.","4","iansmom99"," Disgustingly mediocre

"5290","Honestly, who sits down and writes this sh*te?? Why would anyone think it's good idea to make a crap sequel for an already established crap film?? Wrong turn was poor, but it looks like a modern horror masterpiece in comparison.Sod all atmosphere, sod all tension, the depthless characters are totally expendable - you'll never give a damn if they die or not, the ""inbreeds"" look ridiculous and unconvincing, the film has borrowed numerous ideas from great horror films and utilized them to absolutely no effect and once the violence becomes over-gratuitous (which is the first 4 minutes), like any movie, it becomes boring and about as scary as a blind puppy with no teeth. Oh dear.Predictable direction, predictable plot, predictable ending. Clearly made for the money alone. If you like watching pointless people dying in various different, largely predictable ways, you'll love this crap. The rest of you who are looking for an ACTUAL horror movie, only watch this if you feel like having a good laugh before getting depressed about the amount of this kind of sh*te that's soullessly churned out, year after year. Oh, and the acting is w**k too.","2","Gefafwisp"," Complete and total rubbish, as expected.

"5291","Now I enjoyed the first one, the girl was cute, the rednecks were freaky but all in all it was a relatively simply, low key Hollywood horror that pushed a few buttons and kept me entertained.I hoped a sequel would come, on paper it looked promising; a first time director, larger cast, lower budget, big papa Rollins to ham it up someone called Texas battle and its about a reality TV show...OK on paper it looked a tad dodgy but forget all that, these guys have made a sterling effort to give horror fans what they want, Its got it all really, the effects are spot on for the cash paid to make them, Henry Rollins is the man, I've never seen someone take apart the 'locals' so effectively, the supporting cast adds humour and booty aplenty.Give a first timer a couple of million quid, 20 unknowns, 3 cameras, a forest, an effects guy and a month to make something entertaining and you cant expect much better in my opinion.Good job 7/10","7","obistrike"," Get those Dudes a Mop!

"5292","wow.this is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time.the disgust factor is way too high in this one.i think they were going for the cheap gross out to try to shock the viewer.for me,all they succeeded in was making me nearly lose my lunch.the plot in this one is wafer thin,even for this type of movie.i'd say it was a horror movie,but it's more of a splatter fest than anything else.i don't mind gore and graphic violence in a movie,if there is a point to it.but to me,there was no point for this level of disgust.the effects and makeup are not done very well here,in my opinion.the first Wrong Turn movie was entertaining with interesting characters and some semblance of a plot.and it wasn't as unnecessarily disgusting.Wrong Turn 2 isn't even close to being in the same league.Henry Rollins is the only saving grace to this movie.as a result,i give Wrong Turn 2:Dead End a reluctant 2/10","2","disdressed12"," this movie is Wrong..on so many levels

"5293","Ho-hum...it never amazes me to see just how little substance and just how thin plots can be in movies anymore. Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is just another in a long line of maximum gore and minimal quality that seems to have plagued the horror movie genre. If you have an affinity for buckets of blood, guts and gore; but very little else, then this movie will be right up your alley.Oddly enough, the best acting to be found in this film is not from a trained actor, but a singer: Henry Rollins. Henry is the only person in this movie that brought a true believability to his role, and played it extremely well. Unfortunately his character was short-lived, meeting a demise very early into the film.I find it amusing that, with all the high-tech SFX and camera work that went into this destined-for-the-bargain-bin movie, that the one shining star of the film came from someone (Rollins) whose profession is far removed from the big screen.If you like Henry Rollins, then you will like this film and his performance. If you like a quality movie with an equally crafted script, you may want to pass on this one.","3","WadeVC-1"," A Great Movie...if you have low expectations.

"5294","When Wrong Turn was released in May of 2003 I went to the box office on opening day and sat through 90 so minutes of hillbilly gross-out. The film starred one hot Eilza Dushku (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and reminded me of a cross between The Hills Have Eyes and Deliverance  The Lost Tapes. The film had a group of five good looking young victims falling prey to hillbilly cannibals that have become disfigured likely due to their notions of whetting their sexual appetites with kin (or was it toxic waste  I can't remember). Wrong Turn was a disappointment at the domestic box office taking in only $15 million in receipts and although DVD rentals and sales proved to recoup the film's production budget, I don't think many were thinking sequel at the time.Maybe that is why it took some four years before Wrong Turn 2  Dead End hit the rental store shelves. But alas, here we are in 2007 and to my enjoyment, an unrated version of the sequel was now available for me to bring home for 48 hours for only $5.79. Wrong Turn 2 is directed by Joe Lynch who makes his directorial debut and does as good a job as any veteran of the genre with the material he has been given. In the sequel, another group of five are left in the forests of West Virginia as part of a reality survival program called The Ultimate Survivalist : Apocalypse (yeah, I know). With just them, the small production crew and the host (Henry Rollins who you will all watch and wonder 'where have I seen that guy before?) all alone in the dense forested area, they are easy fodder for the family of deformed hillbillies that will stock, murder, kill and cook these poor unsuspecting victims. One by one or two at a time, they are hunted down like deer and killed in some of the most gruesome methods this side of Hostel. Oh did I mention it was most gruesome? These chaps are hunted down in ways that will leave your hand out of the popcorn box for fear of regurgitating the kernels. If you thought The Hills Have Eyes 2 was over the top, you ain't seen nothing yet. Right from the first victim who ends up with a split personality, you get the full value of the words 'un-rated' that appear on the DVD box cover.Wrong Turn 2 is like taking The Hills Have Eyes, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and even a bit of Rambo and throws them in a blender with your favorite pet. It is a relentless parade of blood and gore that might be short on scares, but certainly not on the fake blood that splattered across my big screen so frequently that the room was aglow of red for most of the second half. When not in kill mode, we still have unsettling scenes like the ode of Chainsaw where the family has a guest over for dinner and serves fellow contestants as appetizers. Amazingly shot in only 25 days, Lynch keeps the pace moving and the body count mounting as one should of a movie that consists of hillbilly maneaters. If you are looking for a film that piles on the gore, then I doubt you can do much better than this  well, that is until Saw 4 comes out around Halloween.I am not giving a full recommendation to the film. Although I got what I wanted from the release, I was thankful I didn't set aside a Saturday evening and strap in with my friends and go to the theatre and pay top dollar for the flick. Especially if I went after dinner. www.robertsreviews.com www.killerreviews.com","6","gregsrants"," Gorefest!

"5295","Wrong Turn 2 was one of my first horror films when I was 12 years old or something and it genuinely terrified me while watching it and that I had to sleep a few nights with light on. So, I finally gave it a second viewing after a few years. It's still an entertaining, brilliant, terrifying and gory movie. The opening scene is still damn good and it got the best kill in Wrong Turn series, no doubt. I honestly loved all cannibals in it, they were actually very entertaining characters and wearing awesome makeups which were better than from the original. I also loved the characters as well, I was glad some of the characters ended up being survivals. It has awful CGI, but I couldn't less care because it made this movie memorable. The last 20 minutes was so fun to watch. It's no better than the original while that one is a classic, but I just love it so much.","10","prolelol"," Absolutely good! Love it.

"5297","(48%) A decent, yet still very much a mixed bag of blood, guts, and cretins. Once the over-the-top opening sequence featuring a death that wouldn't be out of place in a Mortal Kombat video game this takes a nose dive once the reality TV aspect comes into play and this becomes both dull (just like real reality TV) and more abundantly poorly written and acted; although this does start to heat up quite nicely once the redneck mutants get in the picture more. The gore levels here are quite high, the hillbilly barbecue scenes in particular are somewhat stomach turning, and once this gets going towards the end the crappy junk TV elements are forgotten and this is as entertaining as any of the better horror B-movies. It may not have an original bone in its body, but this, despite a poor first half, is worth a look for gore fans.","5","adamscastlevania2"," The first half nearly kills it, but the second just about saves it

Some kills are great and the production value's amazing. These are the kind of sequels we should get with movies... And as I stated I think the first and second Wrong Turn movies are way underrated...seriously 6.1 and 5.5 out of 10??? Anyway I really love these two and you should probably give them a try!

"5302","Wrong Turn 2 has probably the most apt film title of the year. Dead End. That just about says it all. How this film ever got out of the block I will never know.The original Wrong Turn from 2003 was a genuinely atmospheric horror, with both suspense and characters to the fore. You can tell just how bad WT2 is by the fact that the first grisly murder takes place within five minutes of the film starting.We are then plunged into the middle of a reality TV show involving six - or is it seven? - celebrities. Henry Rollins pops up as a US Marine, brought in to 'kick ass' while the various celebrities bicker and squabble as they are paired off and then go off into the woods to see if they can survive more than half-an-hour without a Mars bars, a mobile phone, or a roll of toilet paper.So far so good, and I will admit I did almost enjoy the first thirty minutes. But boy, once the mutants appear, the film goes downhill faster than an episode of Dallas. The director was presumably trying to explore the 'mythology' of this mutant race by showing them up close and personal, but take it from me with people this ugly that's really not a good idea. There may also have been a bit of subtext about not judging others by their appearance, but again, given that the villains were so utterly repulsive, any message about not judging others on their looks is sort of lost as you reach in desperation for the sick bucket.One of the more laughable scenes in the film involves Crystal Lowe trying to seduce a contestant down by the lake. Suggesting to the said contestant that he have sex with her on camera, the lovely Ms Lowe takes her top off to give the film its obligatory nude scene. But standing with her boobs on show is not the turn-on she hoped. Stunned when the object of her desire - the improbably named Texas Battle - rebuffs her advances, Crystal is further shocked to hear that the man's mother and six nieces would not approve of such behaviour. At this point you get the feeling Mr Battle is probably in the wrong movie.As things get steadily worse we are subjected to some ludicrous so-called death scenes, as one by one the contestants meet a grisly end. In a film this bad a sense of humour can often be a saving grace, but unfortunately the script does not allow for it. The director, it seems, was going all out for blood and gore, but sadly all he ended up doing with is reviewer was provoking utter boredom.My advice? - Watch the highly rated original, then forget they ever made a sequel. You'll thank me for it one day.","3","ian_bell"," This whole film is a complete Dead End

"5305","I was not too interested in watching this after the disaster they made of the ""hills have eyes"" sequel. Anyway I liked Part 1 of Wrong Turn and many people told me positive things about it. Now with an opening sequence like this one (believe me... this one rocks big time and already makes for 4 of my 6 points) my doubts were swept aside. Wrong Turn 2 has many things positive in the script... for one its a take on modern media an game shows (which is not new but surely adds to the thousandth regurgitation of the hillbilly subject) and it has Henry Rollins as a Rambo-like army guy who now earns his money with cheap game shows. The story is set in the same woods as the first part where a pilot for a survival reality show is shot with the contestants running around and trying to survive after the nuclear apocalypse. Now the first contestant dies gloriously in he opening sequence and other follow soon. The kills are not as catchy as the opener but it keeps your attention. Also the whole back story of the mutated inbreds is given this time. Although the movie is decent horror entertainment it slides kind of downhill and towards the end loads of illogical things happen... my favorite one is the machine where the inbreds smash their food in... thats a real ridiculous idea and the second its introduced you know why. The gore flows and splatters in high doses when people explode, hillbillys get smashed and blonde chicks torn in half. Beside the holes in the plot and several ridiculous scenes he acting of several of the characters was kind of bad and clichéd... and the ending once again made me sigh. This is another bad one that makes me wonder if its a comedy or just a lobotomized script writer. If you want a decent load of gore, screwing hillbilly mutants, good ole monster family fun like in TCM2 and the best ""chopped in half"" scene in film history... watch this, but bring a six pack and don't be too sober to follow the lame plot.","6","dschmeding"," 10point opening, 1point ending

"5306","Wrong turn 2 for me was great, the violence wasn't disappointing and the actors weren't TOO bad. The film is about 6 reality stars who go on a reality show for a 100,000 dollared prize but there are cannibals who are very hungry. The film opening is great, Kimberly doesn't do very well before she is easily killed gruesomely. The other characters are: Nina (Gothic girl), Jake (Jockey), Dale (Ex marine), Amber (Marine), Elena (Slut), Jonesy (Skater), Mara (Average girl), M (Mara's boyfriend). All the characters are obvious ones, they all play a certain role and you get to know them pretty well. Surprisingly Mara is killed of pretty quick getting an axe to the head, The slut is then killed after flashing her boobs for a few seconds, she is then killed by the cannibal sister being stabbed several times in the back in a lake, revealing her spine (not nice). Amber and Jonesy are killed together, Dale sadly is killed gruesomely and M is killed (no-one cares about him though as he cheats on Mara with Elena).Altogether the film is pretty good and i recommend it.","9","gavintaylor50"," A awesome film.

"5307","Teen slasher flick sequel manages to engage rather than bore, despite a fairly thin plot.APOCALYPSE! It's the new reality TV show where contestants compete for a £100k prize in the scenario of them being the last 7 people alive on earth, including the show's macho host.What these poor blighters don't know is the forest zone they're filming in is inhabited by more of the hideously deformed mutations as proudly adorning the original movie. Inbreeding has been going on again, and once again these freaks hunt humans and eat them.So what starts out as a fun reality game soon becomes a fight for survival against deformed cannibal psychos.And this is where the games begin; by God this movie is gory! I don't think I've seen more blood and guts in a film in my life - and some of the violence and carnage is way beyond the Saw movies. This is true gore horror at its finest. Sure, some bits look a little dodgy and not wholly convincing, but others look great and truly make your toenails curl.The makeup on the mutations isn't all that bad either, managing to look decently hideous.And the plot is as deep as it needs to be - it is aided by fast and exciting direction which makes the movie feel shorter than it is.As long as you are ready for an inordinate amount of gore, you will get a real kick out of this.","7","Danny_G13"," Insane levels of gore, but surprisingly fun

I would also like to comment that the special effects are great for a film of its budget. The scene locations throughout the film also add greatly towards the terrifying feel that the film gives.

"5311","~Spoiler~Wrong Turn was a terrific sleeper hit. No one really expected it to be as good as it was. So there is no reason to think that the sequel should be anything less, right? Well, I still had my reservations about it. No returning cast members, no Stan Winston, and the whole ""reality TV"" aspect were real reasons to get worried. The sequel is about a reality show pitting 6 contestants against each other in the middle of the West Virginia backwoods. And they are not alone. It would seem that the mutants from the original have some kinfolks who don't take kindly to strangers. My only problem with the film is the plot. The whole reality show thing is cheesy and will date the film very badly. You will be able to watch the original film 20 years from now and not be bothered by anything. But I get the feeling this one won't hold up as well in the future. Having said that, every other aspect of this movie is fantastic, not to mention fun. The characters all start out as walking clichés but actually show depth as the film goes on. No one does that anymore. It's great to see writing that is aware that you need to care about the characters. And the actors playing the characters do the writing justice. Especially Henry Rollins. This guy needs more genre work. Erica Leerhsen and Texas Battle are both excellent and Aleksa Palladino was really wonderful. In fact, I thought she was the main character until a flying axe came out of nowhere. Again, wonderful writing keeps you on your toes. Special thanks also goes out to Crystal Lowe, who does not shy away from nudity and always gets killed in a brutal fashion. I really liked Kimberly Caldwell too. She was such a cutie I felt bad for her when she went. My girlfriend had to explain who she is because I was not familiar with her in the world of reality TV. But, in turn I had to explain who Ken Kirzinger is in the world of horror. He plays the main villain this time out. And they were also able to get the Old Timer (Wayne Robson) from the original to appear. In no big reveal, he is the father of the cannibals. Have I talked about the actors enough? Let's get to the gore. People are chopped in half...length-wise, thrown into grinders, scalped, and die in all manner of brutal ways. It's fantastic stuff. It should satisfy most guys and gals who love the grue. The ending sets up the possibility for yet another sequel. It could happen if the DVD continues to sell well. In closing I think director Joe Lynch has a solid future in this genre. Don't disappoint us.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","Backlash007"," ""You can't afford to make a wrong turn here.""

"5312","OK now I sort of liked this movie, it was a gory horror sequel to a good horror movie. I loved the strong horror violence and gore, but some scenes were just really disturbing and i'm talking about some of the scenes in this film that involve the inbred cannibals in sexual situations that absolutely no one would ever care to see, not even the sickest people on the planet. Henry Rollins did a good job as the ex-marine who would stop at nothing to take down the psychos and Erica Leerhsen did a good job too. I give this one a 7 out of 10 because it was good, but it could have done without some of the scenes that I was discussing up above. I would recommend this film to all horror movie fans, but I wouldn't recommend it to those who are disturbed or sickened easily, definitely not for the weak stomached.","7","dustinhunter707"," Entertaining and gory, but some scenes were inappropriate

"5313","Wrong Turn 2 (2007) is a movie I recently watched off Amazon Prime for $3.99. The storyline is about a group of people in the West Virginia woods filming a reality television series when they run into some unanticipated locals. This movie is directed by Joe Lynch (Mayhem) and stars Henry Rollins (Feast), Erica Leerhsen (Blair Witch 2), Texas Battle (Final Destination 3), Steve Braun (Harold and Kumar go to White Castle) and Daniella Alonso (The Collector). The storyline for this was a little crazy and wasn't executed as well as the first one; however, it is interesting enough to want to see how it unfolds. Henry Rollins just isn't a good actor. Period. You did get to see the lifestyle of the cannibals in more depth in this film. I will give the film credit for some entertaining scenes - the sex scene in the woods with the scalp was hilarious as was the opening kill where he cuts the girl in half with the ax. This wasn't awful, but definitely a step back from the original. I do recommend seeing this and would score it a 5.5/10.","5","kevin_robbins"," This wasn't awful, but definitely a step back from the original

"5315","Loved the very first wrong turn, but this one is just absurd, from the characters, their choices, how they're written and the endless plot holes...So, first off, we're supposed to believe that a combat veteran is going to have no idea what to do when people start dying but some college football player is going to? She was so incompetent it was maddening. First, her salutes were awful, second her weapon of choice would prove to be completely useless, much like her. Glad they killed her.The skater guy was a completely worthless piece of duechebag as well. Like, these were supposed to be candidates for a survival show? The only likeable character in the movie they kill early on, disappointingly so.No idea why the technical crew wasn't killed, they had to spend ample time in those woods setting up the traps and tree cameras, but they just walked right out, skippedy do da.Rollins was ok, but after finally being all tactical he just throws it all away for no reason at all. I dunno, this movie was trash. The cut scenes and camera zooms are out of whack, imagine zoolander doing his head twist to the camera every time. All the characters are completely unlikable, except for the girlfriend, but they take care of that pretty early unfortunately and we're left a final girl that was worthless the whole movie and the guerrilla warfare tactician football player.3/10 because the deaths were mostly decent but the rest of the actual movie sucked.","3","scorbett315-66-982904"," Stupid is as stupid does I guess

"5318","I was so irritated by the inane bickering and snide humour of Wrong Turn 2: Dead End's beginning sequences that I decided to watch something else. The movie was starting to improve, and certainly there had been a couple of wicked attacks that were cool, and I liked Henry Rollins' character. I gave the movie to my brother and when I next saw him he was watching it, so I eventually came to see the last half as well. Quite an eye opener. The standard between the initial scenes and the penultimate scenes is much improved. I was actually quite amazed at how much terror the movie was generating by then. The actors seemed to be doing way better in the final stages, their dodgy characters having risen to the occasion. As such I'm happy to give this movie a 7. Perhaps not as accomplished as The Hills Have Eyes (2006), but certainly on the way there. Roll your eyes at the opening nonsense.

"5320","Judging from my other reviews, you would not think that horror films would be my thing, especially very gory ones. Actually aim to have a diverse taste in film, so seeing films from all decades and genres with no bias intended. Plus have seen my fair share of horror franchises where at least one film has been good.Found myself surprisingly enjoying 'Wrong Turn' when slowly working my way through the films. The second film, and first sequel, 'Wrong Turn 2: Dead End' is not quite as good but is easily one of the better sequels and films in the series and perhaps the only one of the sequels to be nearly equal to the first. 'Wrong Turn 2: Dead End' is bloodier and gorier than 'Wrong Turn', with the in-jokes, one-liners and put-downs the dialogue is wittier and less cheesy than that in 'Wrong Turn' and it is just as fun. The ending also works better here, it is contrived somewhat but at least there is much more of a sense of a film-knowing-how-to-end-it ending.At the same time, 'Wrong Turn 2: Dead End' does lack the tension-building, suspenseful claustrophobia and mystery of the first film and it is let down by some of the first half being dull and dumb with some of the dialogue being too self-conscious. The story is as simplistic and derivative and the characters as thinly sketched as before.Things pick up significantly in the second half, where things become more thrilling, inventive, fun and skin-crawling. Visually, it is imaginatively and slickly shot if not quite as atmospheric as the first film due to times of being too clean. The setting is wonderfully mysterious and creepy and the effects and make-up are as appropriately horrifying as one would expect. The music has some genuine eeriness and Joe Lynch directs very competently with little time wasted after a slightly too overlong beginning.Despite the lack of development for the characters, the acting is not bad at all. Henry Rollins and Erica Leerhsen are especially well-cast and are just as ballsy as the three leads in the first film.Overall, decently solid and shows that the 'Wrong Turn' series is not yet dead. A dead end this is not. 6/10 Bethany Cox","6","TheLittleSongbird"," The series is not yet dead

"5321","Story: We follow a celebrity diva on her way to a reality television pilot, where she takes, yeah you got it a wrong turn and becomes our first victim. We get to meet the rest of the cast now as they get set to record a reality show about survival after the apocalypse. We see how selfish the characters are but the real battle for survival starts when the games begin and the cannibals join in. Larger cast on both sides of the battle helps the film because we get more confliction, more blood and a larger body count. Saying that we do have to get through a whole host are highly unlikable character with the only ones worth supporting are Dale, Mara and Jake. The story gets to poke a small bit at how ridiculous reality television is now. It could have gone for the found footage angle with all the contestants wearing head camera, but it stays well clear which works well for the film. It really comes off as an improvement from the first film storyline wise feeding into the gorier side of the story. (7/10)Actor ReviewErica Leerhsen: Nina part of the game who wants to keep herself to herself, but has to learn to join in to be part of the game and survive. She does get captured but after having help to escape she makes sure the family never feed again. Erica gives an OK performance but I feel she gets lost in the leading lady role. (5/10)Henry Rollins: Dale host of the show and ex-army guy, after getting captured early on he used his skills to escape and take out the cannibals before getting to rescue the final two. Henry is the star of the show really, you just want to see his character face the cannibals. (8/10)Texas Battle: Jake former college football star whose injuries have left him lacking a career, he enters the game for a chance to show off his athletic skills. He is the honest character who helps everyone out even through another shoulder injury. Texas gives a solid performance as the good guy trying to get back on his feet. (6/10)Aleksa Palladino: Mara producer's assistant who has to take part in the game after one of the contestants doesn't show up. She starts to enjoy the idea of the game before being betrayed and killed off. She gives a solid supporting performance but never gets a chance to show her skills. (5/10)Daniella Alonso: Amber solider with excellent survival skills taking part in the game. Even with her survival skills she struggles against the cannibals. Average performance as her character should be better. (4/10)Support Cast: Mostly other members of the game, the crew and the cannibal family, they all add to the story in their own small ways.

"5322","wrong turn 2 dead end isn't better than the first movie but is a very good sequel. although being direct to DVD the movie was a lot better than most of slasher horror movies thats been out in cinemas for the past 10 years no lie. another thing i like about wrong turn 2 better than wrong turn 1 is that they had much more likable characters than the 1st.the plot is a decent plot but could have been thought of better but still fun to watch. the plot is a group of people are competing to win a reality show including Nina, Jake ,Amber ,Jonesy and last but 100% not least Elena. where they are in the woods home to the hillbillies. so it the deaths start happening 1 by 1.but the same problem that was wrong with the 1st is that you knew the surviours from the beginning and you knew who was going to die next.i liked this movie because it has a lot of laughs and disgusting deaths more graphic than the 1st.just because its a straight to DVD does not mean the movie ist good i thought it was a really good sequel. 6/10","6","arlum_meow"," not better than the 1st but a very good sequel

"5323","""Birth defects. No sh*t.""The ""crazed inbred cannibal hillbillies killing dumb dudes and hot chicks"" genre isn't one of my favorites, but I'm up for the occasional decent movie. Wrong Turn 2 doesn't do much to turn the genre on its head, but at least it's entertaining and offers a few characters that manage to be more than the tired horror movie staples that we've seen countless times. The scenario that brings our victims to the backwoods where the cannibals make their home is a reality show, hosted by a tough-as-nails ex-marine. There's the expected annoying, sleazy, and slutty characters, but we also get a few who are likable and sympathetic. So, you get the pleasure of cheering the deaths of the crappy characters, while hoping that the others can somehow get out of all this alive. The actors are all probably people you've never heard of before, but they do their jobs pretty well.  The cannibals themselves look suitably dirty and inbred, which is about all I expected. There are a few gruesome deaths, but really nothing more over-the-top or violent than what I've seen in other movies. I could have done without the unnecessary jab at religion that was shoehorned in towards the end, but all in all, I'd say that Wrong Turn 2 was okay. If you're really into these kinds of flicks, you'll probably like it even more than I did. And if you're anything like me, the most disturbing scene in this entire movie will be the one where two of those subhuman monsters start making out. Now THAT is horror.","6","lewiskendell"," Not bad, not bad at all.

"5324","I suppose it must count for something that unlike so many horror sequels, Wrong Turn 2 avoids regurgitating the same material as the first. Too bad this is the only thing the movie does right. The more we progress through the story of Wrong Turn 2, the more difficult it becomes to believe that it is intended to be treated as pure horror. There are signs that it wants to be part comedy. Either way, the movie doesn't work. It gets increasingly dull, derivative and it has an overlong finale that Tobe Hooper could probably file a plagiarism suit against.Even though it is perhaps a bit chirpy, the film has an interesting set up. Six kids are about to embark on a Survivor-type game in the woods, while being documented in reality-TV style. before long however, they find themselves fighting not merely to win but to live, as they come face to face with something that definitely was not part of the programme.The ravenous mountain men from the first wrong turn, have lost their monstrosity. There is nothing remotely frightening about these 'men'. Instead they are goofy, and get too much screen time. I suppose in the End the film could've been worse. It's not like I walked out on it, but in the end, it is just too devoid of merit to be worth watching.","5","Samiam3"," Could've been worse, but it's still no good

"5325","This one is more of a gore fest compared to the first one, and revolves around characters that are in some low budget survival game show, like the show ""Survivor"" except the cast are fighting for survival literally after they encounter some inbred hillbilly mutant psychos. I was thoroughly impressed with this sequel, it's just a lot more entertaining and gruesome than the first, however one of the cast members had a ""Battle Royale"" shirt on which is somewhat of a disgrace seeing how much of a awesome movie that was compared to this one. Anyways while the first movie was going in a more serious direction, the characters in this one is comedic and not as serious as the first. From the jerkoff or a more annoying and less funny version of Stifler, to the douche bag boyfriend, to the nice girl, to the tough chick, to the tough guy, to the slut and etc. The characteristics of some of these characters are however sort of creative, with the lesbo, to the sensitive jock, to the bipolar vegan, to the action hero and etc. And through the course of events your views on them change, which was a nice touch and it even had a decent character development which usually don't happen for this type of genre. Another aspect of this film I really liked was how you can't guess who is going to die and who is going to survive, and for films like these you can predict pretty easily, but that wasn't the case for this one. From the beginning scene of the film, I could tell I was in for a bloody good time and wasn't going to be going in a serious direction which really worked. There is one event of this film that seems to happen in a lot of survival horror movies that I really dislike, where the hero or heroine goes back to save someone and end up getting screwed and wished they did more with the reality game show they were on and mock it some more. I also disliked how they gave the inbred hillbillies more human characteristics compared to the first WT, it sort of makes them less creepy. But despite that, this was a entertaining slasher film with a lot of gore and mayhem. If this had a bigger budget, it just might have made it into theaters instead of going straight to DVD and Blu-ray.7/10","7","KineticSeoul"," More bloody, less serious

"5326","A group of reality show contestants, participating in a SURVIVOR-type game in the backwoods of West Virgin-nie, runs afoul of the killer hillbilly family we came to know and love in the first movie. One by one, the contestants are picked off and eaten until we're down to a bloody few. Will anyone survive? Henry Rollins is the only name actor in the cast, and he does a Rambo-like bit when he turns the tables on the killers midway through. Some decent deaths and stunts, although the movie lacks the visceral impact and shock of the original. Also, we see way too much of the hillbillies, so that they become parodies of themselves. In the first movie, we didn't gets as good a look at them until late in the game, and they spoke in a distinctive and sometimes frightening guttural lingo. Here, they are constantly on screen and talk like Hollywood's idea of cave people. Nevertheless, WT2 is worth a look. For horror film fans, there are tributes to THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, THE HILLS HAVE EYES and even Friday THE 13TH (the last is a great bar bet trivia question for those in the know). A second WT sequel, released in 2009, has a busload of escaped prisoners running afoul of the remaining inbreds. Hmnn ... I wonder how tourism is doing in West Virginia these days?

"5328","Back in 2003, I picked up the first Wrong Turn - initially because the gorgeous Eliza Dushku, but now look at it as one of the best horror movies of it's genre. The first movie was great from start to finish. Everything from the look, plot, acting, script etc.. was 110%. The movie relied on pure suspense, instead of pouring endless amounts of blood in your face - Wrong Turn 2: Dead End, has pretty much the opposite, on all of the above.This movie could have been a great sequel, but instead, it comes off cheap, second rate and merely lack luster to it's first. This is probably due to the fact that no person(s) from the first movie were involved with the project - and I can understand why.The movie starts off well, with a great opening - possibly better than the first opening, but after 15 minutes passed I quickly realised It wasn't going to be anything on the original. The story of a reality show in the woods, scary house etc.. has been done to death (House on Haunted Hill, Halloween Resurrection) so the plot seemed dull from the start. The film has no suspense and just lays it all out on the table, and by that I mean anything that's anything (body part wise). There is so much gore that it gets slightly ridiculous. The first movie was well crafted and just gave enough gore to scare you, the sequel however just flows a blood bath, which came off really tacky and desperate. The acting was, okay. There were a couple of actors I was surprised to see on here. Especially Erica Leerhsen. She starred in the 2003 remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and the movie did extremely well. I mean, It was a remake, and most Hollywood remakes get thrashed by critics, but the film actually received great reviews. So she was obviously type casted for this role. Why she wanted to be involved in this project - I don't know. Maybe she thought she was gonna be the next ""Scream Queen"", after this I doubt it. Possibly a second rate B-horror actor. I can see that happening for sure.There were many scenes in the movie that just shouldn't have been included. One being the inbred brother and sister having sex in the woods. There was no need to include this in the movie. When we hear a family is inbred-incest, we know what that means. We certainly don't have to see it happening full swing. The scene is horrific and disgusting. Another downfall is the special effects make-up on the monsters. It was a big disappointment and they resembled nothing like the original mountain men. In the first film you only caught glimpses of the mad men, that made it even more scarier. The ""freaks"" in Dead End however are very in your face and the more screen close ups you get, the more the make-up looks obviously fake and badly done. Very B movie like.Are we surprised this movie didn't see theatrical release? NO.All in all, the movie was below average. When are film makers going to learn, having so much gore does not do any justice to the movie itself. Especially when half the gore doesn't even look semi-real.If you are a fan of the first movie, don't expect the same results with Wrong Turn 2: Dead End. But if you absolutely must see this movie then at least you were warned.","1","Sam_Movie_Buff"," You know what they say, second times the slump!

"5330","The original Wrong Turn seemed like it would be just another Texas Chainsaw Massacre style horror movie...and indeed that's all it was; but it was actually surprisingly decent for what it was and I was pleasantly surprised. Like most people, I thought the idea of a sequel was unwarranted and wasn't particularly interested; but as the largely positive reviews started to roll in, I figured I may as well give the film a chance. Well...I can say that my thoughts on the film aren't as glowing as some of the reviews that I've read, but overall this is an entertaining and well done sequel, and I don't regret watching it. The plot seems rather unimaginative but works quite well. We focus on a new survival-style reality TV show called ""The Ultimate Survivalist: The Apocalypse"", and it just so happens that this game show is being filmed in the woods where the events of the first film took place. After being introduced to the characters (a mostly clichéd lot), they are let loose into the woods and naturally it's not long before they come face to face with the deformed family that the group in the original fell foul of.The film is a sequel in name only really; it does obviously feature the same location and (similar) antagonists, but so do a lot of other films and I guess the name is in place to cash in on the original...not that it really matters. The way the film plays out is completely by the numbers, but director Joe Lynch focuses on the important elements and the film manages to stay entertaining for the duration. We kick off with a sequence that shows some ridiculously over the top gore and that really just sets up the rest of the film. The gore scenes are blood soaked and fairly inventive and see things like people getting axed in the face, hacked to death and split right down the middle. The main difference between this follow up and the original is that we get some more info on the deformed family; both in terms of an explanation (which takes heavy influence from The Hills Have Eyes) and some insight into how they live (culminating in a scene that takes obvious influence from TCM). It's not big and it's not clever, but if you're looking for ninety minutes of entertainment; you could do a hell of a lot worse than this.","6","The_Void"," Blood and guts galore in a surprisingly good sequel

"5331","Wrong Turn 2 - Well, it comes as no surprise that this film is quite simply put... the worst film I think I have ever seen. I thought I'd seen it all with Death Proof, Captivity and Balad Of Ricky Bobby... but this... yes this, is the worst film I've ever seen. It's an insult to the original film (which is an 8/10 for it's genre)... and how it ever got funding is anyones guess. From the first 5 minute intro, you know you're in trouble.. a ridiculous decapitation/slice and the stupidest music ever to accompany it and you know, that you're in for 1.5 hours of drivel... and guess what, I wasn't disappointed.What's wrong with this film is like the world at the moment... they feel the need to do it from the silly perspective of a reality show (anyone remember the reality Halloween?) Why shoukld this be interesting? The characters are all retards who you couldn't care less about... the effect are appalling, the story is ludicrous... the acting is some of the worst I've seen since time began making Jason & The Arganaunts look realistic... I wanted every last one of these teenagers to DIE! And what's worse, is Henry Rollins take on Predator... he basically turns into a Schwarzenegger character. I have to say... that I'm sure this film isn't meant to be taken seriously as surely someone out there doesn't think he's created a masterpiece... however, he has... he's created the benchmark that all other trash films (of which this year 2007 seems to have created the most) should be judged. This is a 0/10 film... however, IMDb won't allow this, so a 1/10 it has to be. Sick twisted and not even inspried gore that isn't very well done at all. If you at least want clever gore, watch Saw III which in itself is appalling, but ingenious in it's ways to die! Stay Clear.","1","pugheaven"," God Awful Watch The Original INstead

"5332","I did not see the first one. I typically avoid stupid, bone-head movies like it. When I heard decent things about this one and that it also had Henry Rollins in it I figured what the hell.For what this film is I can deal with the set-up, as contrived as it is. As far as I could tell there were only two real actors in this thing; Rollins and Wayne Robson (Old Timer). I can't believe I'm actually saying this.The dialogue was hideous. It's littered with cliché after cliché. Good thing it was also littered with corpses.And what the hell is up with the ""halloween hillbillies""? It's as if the film makers said, ""Hey! What if Chunk from The Goonies had kids and then they knocked around and had more kids?"" It would have been more effective if they looked more realistic and less cartoony.I have to give credit for the director, Joe Lynch, who pretty much saved this movie. I'm impressed as much was accomplished with a budget of only 4 mil.One bright side - only two survivors. Most of the characters and all of the contestants were annoying. I was really hoping they would all die. What a nice bonus that would have been. Oh, well. Them's tha breaks, I guess.","4","Score_The_Film"," There's only ONE reason to watch this - Henry Rollins

"5333","Utterly poor, how is that for a review? Some people gather in the woods to shoot an adventurous reality show, but they soon find themselves being hunted by a group of hideous cannibals. Noteworthy is that the characterisation is boring, because all the characters are stereotypes to such an extent that one has problems deciding whether or not this film is a parody of genre, or just extremely cliché and trying to get away with it.I can conceive of the target audience of the film being either teenagers or young adults; the film only features stereotyped characters; the soundtrack is pretty limited to teenage pop-rock music; some of the experiences of the characters, prior to the gory part of the film, are simply those teenagers or young adults are likely to experience.I guess Henry Rollins is the true hero of this film and the only reason why I am not giving this film a 1/10 vote. Amidst poor effects and even poorer acting, Henry Rollins contributes in a great way to this film with his Ramboish cliché character.Even if you are looking for a film which requires no thought whatsoever, I would not recommend this film.3/10","3","scobbah"," Henry Rollins saves WT2 from 1/10 vote

It was pretty predictable that the token Asian Guy died 1st. Henry Rollins as a former Marine Colonel gets captured by the mountain people WAY too easily. The camera guy is caught by his girlfriend getting a blow job so you know he is going to die! It also gets the producer girl killed by an Axe in the head as she escaped from the house. Cutting to the cameraman boyfriend (totally unaware his lady is dead) with the girl who had been giving him a blow job pulling on her panties is there to tell us they have had sex while his girlfriend was being killed. As any good horror fan knows that means both of them will die, having had sex.We also get a shot of one of the mountain people who had obviously been watching them and we're supposed to assume he's masturbating as he watches the girl. She is killed by the girl of the mountain people (slashed to death in a stream) and now we're getting to see the mountain people's faces a lot so their no longer sticking with the old horror convention of ""the less you see the monster the more scary it is"".Rollins manages to get free, has a brief fight and kills one of the mountain men (there appear to be 5 of them, so that leaves 4?) with a shotgun. The scene between him and the old man (it is obvious he IS the father of mountain people) is played out to quieten down the pace of the film. The father gets a good death scene (blown apart by a stick of dynamite), leaving us with 4 of the freaks left.As the surviving group of contestants escapes they hear the sounds of sex (again?) and it's the brother & sister of the mountain people family practicing incest. The survivor group then break the next horror film rule by splitting up (never split up, safety in numbers!).The black jock saves Nina from a mantrap, only to re-injure his shoulder (he's only been talking about it for the whole film to this point!). Jones & Amber are captured by 2 stupidly simple traps. Jones is killed by the son of the mountain people (arrow through the eye) and it appears he also killed Amber with same arrow. Funny that, my money was on Amber to live as a female Marine.The cameraman boyfriend (M) is killed next by the sister of the mountain people (some sort of cleaver, chopping his head off) and the blond girl is captured outside the camera truck as the black jock watches M die on camera.As predicted the vegan girl is fed cooked human flesh (the ultimate insult to her as a vegan of course but was so easily predicted by me). Then having shown us an industrial grade shredder you know someone will later be thrown into or fall into that, it was an obvious set-up for a future scene. Rollins cuts himself to lay a fake trail of blood to follow (to obviously lead the brother and sister into a trap).He shoots the brother in the back with an arrow but it has dynamite on blowing him up (it is unknown at this point if the sister was blown up too but I assumed she was). Now Nina looks like she was secured by her arms to the chair by razor-wire. Rollins uses his knife to free her but she gets cut pretty badly.Rollins is finally killed by a combination of 2 arrows to the torso and a chain bolas around the throat (but he had been stabbed previously 3 times as well) after freeing Nina and the black jock.The father tries to feed the black jock into the shredder (what did I tell you, this film is nothing if not predictable?) but Nina comes back, knocks over the mother to save the Jock, the mother half pulls the father out but Nina slams them both into the shredder with by releasing a previously unseen log (Ah! it's a shredder to make logs into paper because its a Paper Mill!).The final scene is a little naughty as clearly the film makers lost count how many of the mountain family had died (all of them except the baby, even though the daughter was never actually seen to die) with an unseen and assumed male mountain person feeding the families baby on the chemicals that caused them to deform.Weak Film, Weak and VERY Predictable plot and extremely weak ending.It's a bad film when the film makers can't keep track of how many of their own characters they've killed.","1","raypdaley182"," Oh no, Not Again

"5336","Lordy this was lame. The first one had a far superior storyline and actually had me interested, even wanting the folks NOT to die. This feeling was retracted somewhat in no.2 because the characters either were such bad actors or they ANNOYED THE POPCORN OUTTA ME! It's a reality game show (woopee do, I'm sure this sounds familiar) where they have to survive in the forest for 5 days. It REALLY annoys me when they start the killing too early in movies, why can't they build a storyline and tension, then deliver the gore? After the first death, a blond chick who got sliced, her body looked so fake/rubber when they dragged her away, it was practically bouncing down the road. The most annoying character was the x-games guy, he was the one i wanted the most to die. (unfortunately i had to wait over an hour for this to happen) He was simply over the top dumb, with stupid sexual innuendo jokes that were in no way funny, for example he would see a spear and say to a girl 'ooo look, its so hard and long hahahahaha' SHUT IT! what a goober. When the game show host was introducing the game he said the number '2', immediately the goober guy said 'ooo i just did one of those at the gas station' COME ON! Of course dumb dialogue was not isolated, when they were looking for their friends after they were missing one guy ingeniously exclaimed 'let's take the woods, if we take the road we'll be sitting ducks' Advantages of taking the road: you can see what's going on, have a chance of seeing a car to help. Advantages of taking the woods: you have a great chance of getting lost and an even better chance of being sliced and diced by the yocal inbreds that live there. hmmm tough choice?! This movie is just a copy with dumb youngsters doing dumb things and getting rightfully slaughtered for their mistakes! like when they see 2 inbreds getting jiggy with it (totally unnecessary scene) one kid shouts 'hey!' WHY?! and then one girl randomly runs off and falls in a hole. The rest fight and nearly die. There is one line that the blond and the athlete keep saying that i so 1980's - 'sue me'. They seem to think it's really funny and keep saying it, my thoughts - SHUT UP. I will leave on a positive note, there is one funny line for the game show host/commando guy, after blowing up an old man with dynamite, (whose wife died sometime in he past) he delivers this beauty - 'say hello to the missus' not great, but enough to make me smile.

I love the first one, which also inspired me to write a film-script. This is a travesty!!! I read a review that the actors were good. Okay! Can we say acting-school? Their the lowest of low. How any of them even gets jobs is out of this world. Henry Rollins ain't that bad though. I like the story. Actually been thinking the same idea myself. This is not what i would have made. I think horror should be done with grace not gulp! The only halfly amusing was the opening scene, were a girl gets chopped in half. When i saw that i thought this would be great. I almost fell asleep during the rest. Who wants to get to know these creatures? in the first one they were creepy as s**t, but now they just annoy me. Please don't make any more of these films.

"5339","The first ""Wrong Turn"" was hardly original, but it had vigor, suspense and a few good twists of fate. This is your typical franchise cashout, in that they decide to immediately go for a broad, bad-taste comedy tone with annoying characters representing various stereotypes, and an already-exhausted point of ""satire"" (the victims are reality-show contestants this time) as the story gimmick.The good news is that the film is decently paced and is pretty zesty as far as violence/gore goes. The bad news is...well, pretty much everything else. I've found Henry Rollins variable as an actor, yet he's the best thing here-the only performer who (in basically playing a semi-parodic Rambo) manages to acknowledge the ridiculousness of the material while nonetheless making it work. The others are just one kind of caricature or another, whether it's shallow, then panicked victims or grotesque ""cannibal mutant hillbillies"" who have to be shown french kissing and such.The film has sufficient energy, and is ""stupid"" in a semi-deliberate, jokey way. But it's still...well, stupid, neither scary enough to qualify as real horror or clever/funny enough to rate as good horror-comedy. The climax (though it starts out less as an homage to the original ""Texas Chainsaw"" than blatant imitation) at least ratchets things up a notch through sheer splattery excess; hence the 5 rating, rather than a 4. Still, it's weird to me that so many people seem to think this is better than the original. Then again, you can never underestimate how many fanboy types think dumb yoks and over-the-top gore are all you need for perfect entertainment.","5","ofumalow"," Not dull, but pretty braindead

"5343","Retired Colonal Dale Murphy is hosting a tough survivor show where the winner takes $ 100,000.00. The proposal of the reality show is to survive in the woods in the most adverse conditions, following predetermined rules. Soon the contestants find that they are really fighting to survive against a strong, sadistic and violent cannibalistic family. Colonel Dale discloses that many years ago, an abandoned pulp mill released chemical waste into the creek, killing the animals and transforming the descendants of a local family in deformed mutants. Without animals to hunt or fish to catch, the next generation chases travellers to feed themselves.......The first Wrong Turn was a surprisingly effective horror movie which felt like a throwback to early Craven horror, and was a breath of fresh air in cinemas that were rife with gore laden horror remakes.So it was inevitable that somewhere down the line there would be a sequel of some sorts, but alarm bells always ring when the film is a straight to DVD release, especially when Hollow Man 2, Single White Female 2, The Net 2.0, and 8mm 2 were released around the same time.So its good news that it's an impressive sequel, and doesn't tarnish the original one bit (which the same cannot be said for the other entries in this franchise).It has novelty value by adding the element of reality TV in the mix, and while it doesn't add anything to the narrative, it gives the film an excuse to have pretty people in the woods for a second time.Characters are as predictable as you would expect from a movie like this. Flesh revealing harlots,cheating boyfriends, and divas all get their just Desserts, and the film is spectacularly disgusting in several parts, particularly the opening scene.But what really puts this film above other STDVD horrors, is the wonderful humour injected in the script, because it's laugh out loud funny at times, which does help when you realise that it's not exactly a scare fest.It's easily the best sequel of the five that have been released, and it remains faithful to the first movie.","7","FlashCallahan"," Say hello to the Mrs for me.......

"5344","Wrong Turn was an average, but entertaining enough backwoods slasher in the vein of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes. Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is exactly the same, except it has more gore and absolutely no atmosphere. This straight-to-DVD sequel is nothing special, and is more of an action/horror movie than a straight out horror movie. First off, it has a fairly fast pace, meaning that characters have a standard introductory scene, and if they are lucky enough, a two minute scene revealing their past and why we should feel sorry for them. Secondly, the acting is bad, well, Erica Leerhsen is quite good, she does a decent job as the heroine but no one else is interesting in the slightest. Furthermore, the story is nothing to write home about, and in a film like this, it really doesn't need to be Oscar material. Also, the dialogue is atrocious, with way too many bad one-liners and lame attempts at humour. However, not all is bad, for all the gorehounds out there, this film ramps up the level from the first film, and has some surprisingly brutal death scenes (especially the opening, which I thought was well played out). Moreover, the film never gets boring, director Joe Lynch is smart enough to know we want outrageous death scenes and lots of brainless action, and he does deliver on that part. The villains are stereotypical inbred hillbillies, with all the deformities and family bonding we have all seen done better before.Wrong Turn 2 never promised to be anything big or genre-defining, and although it is an appalling film, it is also entertaining and for people looking for a cheap thrill, you can't do much better than this nowadays.2/5","4","LoneWolfAndCub"," An awful sequel to an average movie, but not without its charms

"5348","If you are looking for a intelligent, well acted and original gore film, do not watch this. However, if you are looking for a fun night in that occasionally makes you laugh and wince at the same time, Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is certainly for you.I have seen so many gore/slasher films and most of them are as predictable as England losing a penalty shootout. You can always tell by guessing who is going to survive before the killing begins. Usually I'm spot on but this time my top two three nominations died. This is refreshing and makes you want to see the end to see if there any more surprises.Again the actual deaths usually are slightly un-original e.g. head decapitated. But not this film, the first death makes you recoil so much that you end up molded to the chair your sitting in and there is one more death that I don't think has ever been done before.There is a slight bit of storytelling and back story for the main characters but mostly it is just kill and kill and kill. Overall it was a very surprising and enjoyable film (apart from the end) and it baffles me that this was a direct to DVD while Hills have Eyes got a theatrical release.","7","abbo450"," It really isn't bad.

"5349","You heard right. Anybody who looks for new gore that can actually be compared to 80s/90s films like Day of the Dead and Hellraiser 2 (or even Braindead), your film is this.This is one of the most violent films I've seen for a long time. Interesting ideas too - Not to ignore the opening scene of an actress being sliced clean in half from the head down, and having both halves dragged across the floor by two inbreds - while having that, it also keeps an element of classic twisted gore visuals (such as a carcass suspended from the feet, intestines dangling into a bucket etc).A great film needs more than impressive gore though. Like I said, if that's your thing, and you're looking for the nastiest films, this ranks somewhere near the top.It is entertaining enough, but the characters have barely any depth. You basically have to interpret the characters by what you first see of them, and it's all very stereotypical. In ways of plot, a lot of the things were very mundane and predictable. It sort of needs to be for this kind of film, but there wasn't much chemistry between the characters - the standout for that was the demise of Jonesy (Steve Braun) and Amber (Daniella Alonso) at how they developed some kind of acceptance for each other before they died.There wasn't much of a breather for this film - when everything starting to kick in during the beginning it never paused. They should have taken a break amidst the terror and built some foundation between the people about to be slaughtered.I say that though, doesn't mean the acting was flat...Top notch performance from everyone, they all stayed committed and determined to stay within their persona during the film, they just weren't performing for their full potential.Some parts were just plain nasty, and I'm not talking about the violence. Inbred sex is the main thing I'm talking about. INCEST inbred sex. I knew at some point they would have had a visual like that, but I was still unprepared. It's sick...and again if that's what you're looking for...To sum it up (for those who can't be bothered to read all of this) Wrong Turn 2 is definitely a film for visuals. It should definitely be recognised and respected amongst the goriest films ever made. I've seen violent films that had more character development and emotional interaction though (the Saw films come to mind) and this film could have done a little more to build on the cast and the plot.Plot/Characters - 3/10 Violence/Visuals - 10/10 Acting - 9/10 Quality/Effects - 9/10 Sound - 7/10OVERALL: 7/10","7","mothergeorge"," Not much depth, but gore.

"5350","Wrong Turn 2: Dead End was quite a good film, but for me it went quite over-the-top with all of the violence, blood and gore. It seemed to me like they were just putting in all of this senseless and bloody violence just for the sake of it. It seemed like a feeble attempt to gain an ""18"" certificate. But, don't get me wrong, it was a good film. Some moderately scary moments, but most of the time it was just thrilling, edge-of-the-seat stuff.Of course, when you watch a film about cannibals, of course you're going to get blood and gore and violence, but for me it was just a little too much in this film. I wouldn't recommend this film to anybody under the age of 16.I enjoyed watching it, and I found some of the deaths amusing, but in the end I just grew tired of all the violence. I guess you could say that I have mixed views on this film. Still, the final scene of the movie leaves the plot open for a ""Wrong Turn 3"".","5","Andy20789"," A Good Film

"5351","When the original Wrong Turn came out I was sort of curious and uninterested at the same time. I saw it and I liked it, but it didn't really stay with me. Yet it was good. When i heard that they were going to make a second, my reaction was the same, yet I was less interested. But it turned out to be okay.The basic Wrong Turn concept is typical horror. Teens in the woods with weird things running around trying to kill them. Except instead of creatures, the weird things are in fact deformed cannibal hicks who want to eat them. They are weird looking, but not scary or disgusting.The story of this odd sequel is there are a group of young actors/""real people"" who are starring in a fake reality show that turns in to a fight for their lives in minutes with mutant cantabiles who want them for dinner. The 93 minute blood bath is typical new horror with a bit of a twist and some cool moments. However the film fails to deliver as the first did, and lacks any real point to the story. Rent it if you love blood and guts, but if you have second thoughts, go with them.Overall Wrong Turn 2 Dead End is nothing amazing, and isn't anything that will leave you stunned. But if you like insane mutant on human action and gore, you should enjoy this one.","5","horrorforpresident"," Well it was Okay, Not as good as the first

"5352","A group of twenty-somethings, as part of a Survivor clone reality show, are stuck in the woods amidst a barrage of mutant, inbred hillbillies and must fight for their lives. You've seen this before, right? Of course. What you haven't seen before, though, is this premise done well.Neoteric director Joe Lynch takes us on a journey of sordid proportions as we see what life is really like when you ingest toxic waste and don't become a superhero. The mutants have much more screen time and human appeal than the original. They watch television, eat, and pray together. All the things that normal families do. The father even lets his son use his bow to murder their soon to be family dinner. If that's not love, I don't know what is.The cast is well rounded with Henry Rollins and Erica Leerhsen being the primary focus. Rollins is, as usual, inimitably portraying the hardcore, tough-as-nails ex-marine that we love him for. Throughout the bulk of the movie, as the other characters are making a mad dash around frantically and yelling at each other, he is tactically hiding in the woods planning and preparing himself and looks a lot like a low-budget Rambo in the process. Leerhsen, on the other hand, is running through every nook and cranny of the forest to avoid the mutants, yet always runs into them. I have to hand it to her, though, her performance was the best I've seen in awhile in any movie.If you've ever watched an H.G. Lewis movie and enjoyed it, you'll love this.","7","sabenge"," Sue me

"5353","i just saw wrong turn 2:dead end on DVD. it was one of those sequels that you expect a lot out of( considering the fact that wrong turn was a great thriller), yet i did not get the thrill the first wrong turn put me through.the movie focuses upon a group of reality show contestants finding themselves stranded in a forest inhabited by deformed cannibals. i must say this sequel had a lot more violence and gore than the first one. although director Joe Lynch decided to put a tremendous amount of blood and violence in the movie, in my opinion the casting was weak and the acting was prosaic,nothing special. but i gotta say young actress Erica Leerhesen( she played Nina in the movie) did impress me the most. especially after seeing her in Texas chainsaw massacre and the other roles she has played, i believe she is an incredible actress.one thing that disappointed me the most was the lack of suspenseful moments, i mean when i saw the first wrong turn i had to get off my seat every 10 or 15 minutes. i was expecting the same thing on the sequel. but what i got did not impress me that much.if you are somebody who hasn't seen this movie and wants to see it, my advice is go ahead, give it a try. it is not a bad movie. it is just that it did not put me in a thrill ride as i was hoping it would.compared to some desperate movies in the genre of horror such as the remake of Halloween(I'm talking about the one rob zombie just made in 2007, the one that made me regret that i went to the movies to see such an awful movie), wrong turn 2 is an OK movie. but it is definitely not better than the first wrong turn. my overall perspective of the movie is that it was not the worst sequel, yet could have been a lot better.","6","MairegChernet"," yet another run-of-the-mill sequel.

There's not a lot of scare factor to this film as the ""monsters"" even with the horrid deformities seem almost comic like but still it definitely brings the gore. Even more gore than the first film and probably more than a lot of other big screen slashers but lets be honest, with this type of movie, without lots of gore it would just fail miserably so kudos to the director and his team on that.

Who again have managed to start a car collection that anyone would be proud to own. They could have a field day on ebay. I mean in one of those cars a laptop must exist. Therefore they could have had more money bought a few things had them delivered, maybe ordered a Christmas hamper and ate the delivery dude. Now let me think. Hum! they could not have been too far into the backwoods as there where plenty of cars and these idiots on the survivor show where there. So why no man-hunts for all these missing people? And why is it assumed that these monsters would act this way? And although it would be difficult due to deformities for some of these people to speak (apart from a clear Amen) You would think the parents of the original kids would teach them simple language skills. But I digress (And yes expect far too much from my film-makers)Again predictable deaths (up to a point) and much too quick, for these tormenting cannibals, who actually enjoy playing with their food. Biggest loss Henry Rollins He should have survived and got away. What idiot scriptwriter/director though killing him was a good idea. He was so funny in parts and I laughed out loud at his quips and Rambo-esquire fight preparations. Bad bad film-makers for killing him off.

He gets a chance to blow a man to smithereens with a stick of dynamite, blow one cannibal away with a powerful shot-gun blast that sends that joker sky-rocketing, and even hits one inbred with an arrow shot with taped dynamite that ignites the bastard and his girlfriend/sister. Oh, but the family get in on the fun, too. When two contestants get caught on one of those rope traps that suspends you upside down in the air, they receive an arrow through the eyeball. Another contestant is sliced repeatedly in the back by a butcher knife that exposes her spine. One gets his head removed in bloody fashion and we later see it worked on by the family in preparation for supper. In a surprising change of pace, the film seems to build one female character as a slasher heroine(she has all the goody-two-shoes traits that make her a sympathetic cliché)only to see her get the axe..literally. And, we must not forget the very opening kill, which sets up the brutal nature of the rest of this splatter-fest, as a female contestant gets her lower lip and chin-skin eaten away by one of the inbreds and then split right down the middle by another inbred with an axe.The character cliché list includes a skateboarder jokester, a very bitchy vegan, a female producer whose so in love with her executive producing boyfriend she'll join the team when the other contestant ""opted out""(the one who isn't present introduced a tattoo that offers a nice little gruesome joke for twisted effect), a black football star whose career was cut short due to injury, and a lesbian military officer..all these contestants are sent into the woods to, unbeknownest to them, square off not in competition with each other but against a foe who understands this area a teeny bit better. Erica Leerhsen(the wiccan in BLAIR WITCH 2, and victim of Leatherface in the 1998 remake of Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE) gets the lead, finally, in a horror film as a suicidal victim of a hard relationship and the new horror hottie right now, Crystal Lowe , as a slutty model who plans to help boost ratings by adding spice to the show. Ken Kirzinger(Jason Voorhies of FREDDY VS JASON)has the role of head mutant who swings a mean axe and is a dead aim with a cross-bow.","5","Scarecrow-88"," Wrong Turn 2:Dead End

Oh did I regret that or what! It would be nice if all the marketing teams would stop trying to promote their movies this way, it really makes it harder to know which movies are worth seeing...The acting is dumb, the dialogs makes your head twitch and the storyline is messed up. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the gory scenes actually look quite real.

"5362","While out in the Virginia woods, a group filming the pilot for a survivalist reality TV show run across a group of deformed inbred cannibals intent on killing and eating them all, forcing them into a real-life race for survival against the vicious killers to get out of the woods alive.This was an awesome, brutal, hyper-gory and entertaining slasher effort that was much more enjoyable than expected and wasn't at all expected. One of the best elements here with this one is the outline of the proposed reality show they're attempting to film is quite fun and original and would've been quite a hit. The apocalyptic scenario is worn through really well here, and since they're given quite a lengthy introduction which makes for a solid layout and gives this a really enjoyable setup to lead into the action once they get going into the woods. The opening roadside ambush on the detour trail, the first encounters with the crew being seen over the game's video monitors and the great attack on the host along the treeline before getting abducted by the group get this going nicely along into some great chase scenes here. There's the chilling escape from their house where after watching them give birth on the table they have to run off into the woods which leads to some great chasing, a truly enjoyable ambush down by the river where a bikini-clad contestant is alerted to their presence by the blaring game contraptions and causing them to come roaring out of the jungle hacking away with the knife leading to a gruesome, bloody kill and the rather fun and thrilling scene where the host escapes and battles with the lone member left at the campground which features some solid action throughout as well as getting to up the brutality angle. That brutality angle is furthered in the final half where they're finally aware that somethings going on in the woods around them, the last set of traps in the forest as they get hunted rather viciously and setting the stage for the great finale in the abandoned plant. The setting is great, but once the family arrives there's plenty to like as the non-stop tormenting of the family forcing them into rather brutal attacks to stop them gives this some really over-the-top moments that gives this a lot to really like. Alongside the graphic and brutal gory kills, there's also a lot to really like here with the family as their demented nature, gruesome looks and hilarious social structure makes for some intimidating and imposing villains. These here give this a lot to really like, except for one sequence here most will spot easily. This is the lame and protracted dinner sequence in the finale which is a shot-for-shot lift of such a classic scene from another horror effort and even manages to crib the same mannerisms and mocking tone while doing so, an activity that flies in the Face of their established behavior only to showcase this homage which lowers it significantly. An early kill scene featured here is also worth mentioning for the CGI needed to showcase it is so distracting that there's nothing about it that works. Beyond that, there's nothing really wrong with this one.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.","9","kannibalcorpsegrinder"," Immensely enjoyable and entertaining slasher

"5363","Wrong Turn 2 (2007) ** 1/2 (out of 4) A group of contestants, producers, cameramen and a host (Henry Rollins) heads into the woods of West Virginia to film a reality show but soon they're coming under attack by a cannibal family who are needing some food in their stomachs.The original film went for scares and for the most part was a success but there's no question that this film decided to go in the opposite direction. Instead of there being any real atmosphere or scares, WRONG TURN 2 goes for non-stop violence, outrageously gory scenes and some of the most blood soaked mayhem that you're ever going to see. There are some major problems scattered throughout this film that keeps it from being much better but at the same time, for a sequel, it's really not too bad and there's no doubt that those wanting the red stuff are going to be extremely happy.We'll start with the problems but the biggest is that there are simply way too many characters early on. There are so many different subplots going on at the start of this film and none of them are all that interesting. We've got six contestants all with a story going on and these stories are mixed with other plot points and they just don't go anywhere. These story lines really aren't character development but instead they're just boring dialogue scenes that go no where and add nothing to the picture. Another problem is that there are some scenes early on that just drag on to the point where you're bored. This includes the ""promo"" shot towards the end where the Rollins character is talking about the reality show contest. This here should have been cut all together.The first hour of the film is pretty mediocre but once we get down to the final few characters things really pick up and I'd say the final thirty-minutes are a real blast because we just get all sorts of craziness. What I really liked about the picture is that it really keeps you off guard on who's going to live and who's going to die. I'm not going to lie but I was completely caught off guard with who died first and who ended up surviving. For the most part all of the actors did a nice enough of a job to at least bring the characters to life and make you care about them. Again, there are too many at the start but none of them are overly annoying and there are actually a couple good moments between them including one sequence where two that have been fighting come together as they prepare to die.WRONG TURN 2 succeeds in being downright brutal in terms of violence. There are some very clever death scenes including one poor woman who gets split in half and there are countless other scenes including people getting chopped up, broken apart and even some people being blown to pieces in hilarious fashion. The gore effects are extremely believable and there's no doubt that the budget allowed for gallons of blood. Another major plus are the actual mutant rednecks. All of them have a terrific look and the actors really deserve a lot of credit because they really give these characters a personality no matter how disgusting they are.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","Michael_Elliott"," About the Goriest and Most Violent Film You're Going to See

"5364","First off we're talking about a slasher film here, so any discussion of originality is irrelevant. For its genre, this is a decent enough film.The cast of characters ticks all the requisite boxes. We've got the lovable wise-cracking joker, we've got the slut who provides the nubile young flesh on tap, we've got the cold and beautiful blonde with the troubled past, we've got the jock (who's also the token black guy, thus ticking 2 boxes in the demographic charts), and finally we've got the impossibly gorgeous lesbian (who's also the token Hispanic, thus again killing 2 birds with one stone). This kind of stuff must take all of 15 seconds to pitch to a studio before they start writing the blank cheques. All the same, it's a formula that works, so why mess with it? There's plenty of blood and gore for those keen on it (myself being one), and there are breasts, bikinis, deformed babies, some racy mutant sex, you name it. Some questionable effects, it has to be said (the intestines - of which there are many - look like bright red balloon animals) but those are minor quibbles. This is a film which, despite being so gruesome in places, is supposed to be good late-night fun, to be enjoyed with a pizza, a few beers, and your mates. It probably drives aspiring film-makers - sweating their souls out onto the page to try to get their intensely personal visions made - insane that stuff like this gets made, but hey, it's popular, and has no pretensions to be a work of art.To sum up, it's good fun. You'll find more original things between the pages of a Mills and Boon romance novel, for sure, but not so much bare flesh and splattering blood. Needless to say the ending is nicely set up for the inevitable 3rd part (these mutants seem pretty much indestructible), and I for one will rent it when it comes out, crack open a beer, invite a few friends round, and enjoy the sillier side of life :)","8","davidhall81"," Decent Friday night entertainment

"5365","Let me start with all the negative points this excellent film has possessed in.First of all, story-lines in horror films are important for me. It makes the mood more creepý and rational. Wrong Turn 2 had a story line, but- i felt they needed to add a bit more of it into it. Perhaps add a scene when they captured their first human and when they began to have a taste for human flesh. But they captured the story-line quite well. 7/10The deformed families acted a bit strange in some is really young, he acts like he hasn't killed before, he has a sister. It seems that there were too many at the same time in different scenes. The girl cannibal who killed Elena acted like she was the husband of the boy cannibal masturbating about Elena. And then later on they have sex, only to realise they are siblings because towards the end of the film, the dad and the mum cannibal seem to be the parents of the boy and girl cannibal. And when the brother kills Jonesy and Amber, things start to get crazy. He masturbates, he has a sister. Whom he has sex with! If this is really what the Producers meant to be, this is one screwed up family. 5/10. (Couldnt have tried to add more deformed people, could they?)Last but not least, the story-line of Michael cheating on Mara. I hated how the movie completely forgets about it. All of a sudden Nina, Michael and Elena don't even care about it. Especially Nina, i would have expected her to yell at Michael or at least look for him or something. I think Mara was killed off too early with the axe to the head. Mara should have gone down to Michael and Elena during Michaels 'Afternoon Delight'. Terrible, just terrible, they needed to add some romance to the characters and some conflicts between the cheating of Mara caused by Michael. 3/10Now lets finish with the positive points about Wrong Turn 2.I loved it how the movie was based on a reality TV show. Not like a cliché: when a group of friends go on a drive, car breaks down, goes to look for help, finds out they are being hunted and down and killed one by one. No,no,no. Wrong Turn 2 developed a much better story than that. It got you into the movie cause it was exciting and it got you wondering what would happen during the game with the cannibals hunting all of them down. 8/10My favourite were the deaths in Wrong Turn 2. (Major Spoilers throughout from here) Kimberly: Chopped in half Camera Guy: Throat Slit Mara: Axe to the head Amber And Jonesy: Arrow through each persons eye Elena: Back slashed Dale: Choked to death while losing blood.The deaths were exciting and gory. Including towards the end of the movie when we see the realistic lives of the cannibals. All their food and gore and guts just exploded everywhere. Including their dinner! Yuck! But pretty enjoyable. 10+/10Lastly this movie had a creepy mood to the forest. Every second you think a cannibal will JUMP OUT and slaughter everyone. Its just mad and wonderful. The cannibals adjust and hide really well. They are also scary and creepy as hell! 10/10Overall, Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is an excellent horror flick with good advantages and points to it. Well done Producers and Directors, you have produced a terrifying and creepy cannibal movie.9/10","9","magic-tone"," Solid Outing For The Hungry Hillbillies

"5366","at first i thought that the idea of a survivalist ""game show"" based around this movie would be utterly ridiculous,, i think that Henry Rollins , really made this one work. , Kimberly Caldwell was also pretty good as well. this one involves 6 contestants for a prize of 100,000 dollars to the 'survivor"" of the game.. but little do they know that lurking out in the West Virginia woods are some very pesty inbreeding cannibals and they are hungry,, and also apparently sexually hungry. now let me say upfront that there is a sex scene involving two inbreeds, so if that is offensive, FF past that.. there is a very touching moment in the movie, when the father,, let's his boy shoot the bow and arrow,, and like the two just look at each other in a cool, father and son moment. overall i thought that the movie was a blast,, it was pretty visceral,, i'm also glad that Eliza Duzka did not return she was so annoying in the first one. i think this one is pretty close to the original if not slightly better.","9","kairingler"," inbreeding 2

"5367","To be honest, I had regular-high expectations towards this movie. Recently, I re-watched the original ""Wrong Turn"" and I thought it was almost great if it wasn't for ""Hollywood's contribution"" on it. So i decided to buy this sequel (very cheap!) to watch Henry Rollins kicking some serious ass. Were my expectations delivered? You bet! Did Henry Rollins kicked much asses? Yes, oh yes!""Wrong Turn 2"" stars with a furious pace and doesn't stops until the glorious-gory ending. The first scene of the movie shows a reality t.v. star traveling to the woods to meet with a production staff in order to start filming a new reality t.v. show called ""Apocalypse.""Soon she is murdered and the fun begins! Retired Lt. Col. Dale Murphy is the host of the show and 6 people will be at his charge. We hve the super, extremely hot Elena, Lina the bitch attitude hot chick, Jonesy the funny guy, the athletic guy, and the lesbian tough chick. They are joined by production staff such as the producer and his hot girlfriend. Soon, one by one they will face blood thirsty cannibals that seem to know perfectly the woods and will hunt them. Dale Murphy will get really, really mad and that means serious ass kicking! Except Henry Rollins wearing Rambo clothes and even painting his face. Oh, things become beautiful when he gets mano a mano with the mutants. The man steals the show and delivers a great performance.The acting is really good for it's standards, the direction is very fresh, and the gore is simply amazing. When you get an unrated flick in all of it's glory, nothing can go wrong. Take note Hollywood! This is a better example of how direct to video efforts are even better than ""popular"" and commercial movies. So ""Wrong Turn 2"" had the basic elements in order to get considered as a cult classic DTV effort. I mean, it succeeded in all possible ways: 1- Gore 2- Fast pace 3- Likable characters 4- Sexy, very sexy women & nudity (thank you Crystal Lowe, you got the best body I've seen recently) 5- Henry Rollins slaughtering some damn inbreds. 6- Fast paced direction, and a fantastic fun factor.If you are into DTV Horror or just gory films, please don't rent this on, buy it.

I don't think its as good as the first in the way of the story or characters but its OK if you like horror films and lots of blood and guts. What it lacks in terms of the plot it makes up in with over the top gruesome killings and the total sickness of the weirdo hillbillies. The story for the film is a good one but i don't think it was done as well as it could have been and most of the characters in the film were rather annoying and i was glad they got killed i.e the ugly skinny excuse for a man who cheated on his girlfriend ha ha, glad he got what he deserved lol.

"5370","Retired military commander Colonel Dale Murphy hosts the simulated post-apocalyptic reality show where participants are challenged to survive a remote West Virginia wasteland. But the show turns into a nightmarish showdown when each realizes they are being hunted by an inbred family of cannibals determined to make them all dinner!I kinda sorta liked the first movie. It has its shares of pros and cons but ends up being an average horror movie with nothing special in store. I can say the exact same thing for this little sequel. This is what you expect from any other horror movie. Nudity, sex, gore, violence, clichés, etc so I'm going to give this an average rating.There's nothing new here, obviously, but the movie sure, in some ways, is entertaining. In others, maybe not. Trust me, if you love gore, there's a lot of that here but this film manages to be more mean spirited than the first. Yes, that's why I feel for the characters. Also, I feel for the ""cannibals"". Yes, it's a disgrace.Anyway, this film manages to be better and worse than the first film. This film is more laid back and ""have fun"" type of feel to it. Still, the dialog is sometimes very bad and the performances a little outlandish.If you're a fan of the first film, you may like this. If you're a gore/violence fan, you may like this. If you're a horror fan, you may not like this. If you're looking for a fright flick to see at night and forget tomorrow, this may be the film for you.

"5373","If ever there was a film that had no right being as good as it was, it's Wrong Turn 2. A sequel to an unwatchably bad 2000s slasher that soars in every way that it's predecessor sinks. Not only that, it completely redeems and fully realized the botched premise of another terrible slasher film, Halloween: Resurrection. The film's blend of found footage reality TV with over-the-top slasher gore is funny, creepy and genuinely unpredictable. And it's a sequel to Wrong Turn of all things!The performances are a great deal of fun all around. Erica Leerhsen is great actress who's unfortunately been saddled with mostly terrible movies (Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre '03, e.t.c) that she usually ends up being the best part of. Here, she more than proves herself as a phenomenal lead actress and one of the best anti-final girls I've ever seen. Her Nina is relatable, ferocious and surprisingly complex for a slasher lead and Leerhsen brings a great combination of grit and vulnerability to the role. This is the character that an actress of her caliber always deserved, but never got previously.Speaking of, Texas Battle (best known for Final Destination 3 and Dragonball: Evolution...Yeah) also proves himself a better actor than his filmography would indicate. He manages to give a lot of likability and depth to a character that easily could have just been a jock stereotype. Instead, he's written as acted to be invested in and comes across as a very selfless, honorable and likable hero. I'm surprised his Jake isn't brought up more often as an example of progressive black representation in Horror films.Ken Kirzinger, best known for playing Jason Voorhees in Freddy vs. Jason, proves himself as far more than just a body behind a hockey mask as Pa. He carries such a creepy, foreboding menace and dead stone coldness in his eyes that few monster actors can really nail. He kills and eviscerates with a real purpose and genuinely becomes his villainous character. More unexpectedly, I really bought the love and affection that he held for his family in his body and facial acting. I can see why he was cast in Freddy vs. Jason ad a more human take on his character, as he brings that same mild humanity here. It's a shame he gets so much hate merely for replacing Kane Hodder when he's a great actor in his own right, you can consider this his Hatchet so to speak.The kills are absolutely phenomenal. Both the backwoods and found footage elements are wonderfully realized in some dispatchings that do a perfect job balancing between Looney Tunes on Meth fun and genuine terror. They're the kind of kills that the very best Friday the 13th films capture. Even better, it's not just the villains that help to contribute to those memorable kills; Henry Rollins' Dale Murphy should put a smile on the face of everyone who ever wanted to root for Michael or Jason. In fact, his kills may be the most violent and explosive (pun fully intended) of the movie. Even Nina and Jake manage to get in some pretty cathartic bloody violence against their tormentors by the end. It's always nice to see slasher heroes as brutal and relentless as the villains in these kinds of films.The directing by Joe Lynch is so much better than the first film that it's hard to believe it belongs to the same franchise. The balance between reality TV and slasher is realized wonderfully and it really embraces what we love about both (the tragic, melodramatic backstories of the heroes, the hyperbolic violence, the memorable one liners, the outstanding practical effects, the atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a knife) while ditching what we hate (the predictable survivors, the bad acting, the awful production values) Wrong Turn 2 is definitive proof that Halloween: Resurrection, bad as it was. was onto something when it made the connection between the appeal of the slasher entertainment and millennial obsession with reality TV. It just took a mind like Lynch's to realize it.This is also a great film for people who like their slashers with more twists and turns than a roller coaster. From the unconventional body count (the ""final girl"" archetype is the first one to die) to sharp tonal shifts that genuinely work (the contestants making sex jokes while eating barbecue only to find themselves snacking on a friend), it's a film that always had me on the edge of my seat wondering what was coming next.Wrong Turn 2 is one of the biggest surprises I've ever had watching a Horror film. It's everything I wanted the first movie to be and more. If you were turned off by the first film being little more than a low effort Eliza Dukshu vehicle, I'd highly recommend checking the sequel out. It's better in every single way.","10","TheMovieDoctorful"," Far Too Good For Its Franchise

It had a good script, good actors, likable characters and the mutants was actually scary.In this one, the mutants are just ridiculous, they can talk, which ruins it completely. The most sickening scenes was a mutantwoman giving birth to a mutantbaby, mutants making out and having sex. Why do we have to see this?? Is this what the audience demands, to be satisfied today?? As for the human characters, that we're supposed to root for did'nt care for any of them. They were all just their to be killed in the most disgusting ways and chopped to pieces and eaten. The Rambo-wannabe character was so unbelievably dumb that I just wish he would die really quickly.How the clearly sick screenwriter ever got this garbage financed is beyond me.

Let's face it, the 2003 original was good but certainly not great (and actually already quite derivative of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""), the sequel received the feared straight-to-DVD treatment and the cast is primarily a gathering of nobodies. Only after reading a bunch of praising reviews around here on this website, my curiosity got sparked. People whose opinions I respect and always take into account were referring to ""Wrong Turn 2: Dead End"" as a superior product and literally everybody agreed that the level of blood & gore was much more satisfying. Personally, I can't really say it's better than the original, because it's even more clichéd and depthless, but there's certainly no argument regarding the gore-factor! The lack of theatrical release at least offered one giant advantage, namely there were absolutely no restrictions in the special effects & make-up departments. Not even five minutes into the film and the intestines of a young blond girl (a familiar face for American mainstream TV-viewers) already lay spread out on the streets. After the pleasingly gooey opening comes the overlong and dull but sadly inevitable introduction of the déjà-vu plot and the stereotypical characters. Six greedy & media-horny youngsters participate in the brand new (?) reality-TV show called Ultimate Survivor: The Apocalypse. Former military commander & beefcake host Dale Murphy explains how they'll have to spend five days within the isolated & nearly impenetrable woods of West Virginia, with assignments along the way and no food reserves. Of course, no one's aware these woods are the natural habitat of an inbred family of deformed cannibals. These bloodthirsty and relentless freaks welcome the visitors with open arms and use all their primitive weapons and booby traps to get fresh human meat on the food table. ""Wrong Turn 2"" offers nothing new or special, except a wide & amusing variety of supremely mean-spirited killings, ugliness and perversity. Some of the gory highlights include the birth of a 3rd generation inbred baby, two kills with one arrow, body explosions, an axe in the head and a vicious throat slitting. The absolute cutest toy is a still functioning meat grinder in the cannibals' house and all the victims that go through there end up in barrels full of blood, pus and intestines. Yummy! There's zilch suspense (or what else did you expect?), at the beginning you can immediately appoint which characters will die and in what order, the performances are lamentable and you can count the number of competently written dialogs on the fingers of one hand. ""Wrong Turn 2"" is fun undemanding but also forgettable horror entertainment, nothing more & nothing less.","5","Coventry"," Barrels full of Blood & Gore ... Literally!

"5382","The first time that I saw this movie was in college. It was my first apartment and I was excited when I saw they made a follow up as I thought the original was a solid little slasher film. I'll be honest; I didn't really care for this movie as it didn't capture what I thought the original did. It was fun, but it didn't live up. I have now given this a second watch as part of the Summer Challenge Series for the Podcast Under the Stairs for the 2000s as well as October Horror Movie Challenges. The synopsis here is a group of reality show contestants find themselves fighting for their survival against a family of hideously deformed inbred cannibals who plan to ruthlessly butcher them all.We kick this off in a similar fashion to the original. There is Kimberly (Kimberly Caldwell) who is in a red Mustang, driving through the woods of West Virginia. She is scolding her agent, who I didn't realize was voiced by Patton Oswalt for booking her in this gig. It is a reality TV show. She isn't paying attention and hits someone in the road. When she gets out to check on them, they're still alive and they cut her in half, vertically. Another one appears and they take the pieces of the woman with them.The major premise of this movie is that M (Matthew Currie Holmes) is trying to make a reality survivor show in the middle of the woods. The premise is that the world has ended due to a nuclear holocaust. They are given challenges and there are other things they have to deal with to 'survive' in this game. It is hosted by Dale Murphy (Henry Rollins) who is a former military man. The contestants are Nina Pappas (Erica Leerhsen) who is a bit of a militant vegan and there's Jake Washington (Texas Battle), former college football star. Amber (Daniella Alonso) who is former military. Jonesy Lewis (Steve Braun) was on the X-Games and from the sounds of it, failed pretty hard. Elena (Yan-Kay Crystal Lowe) who is the attractive girl. Kimberly was supposed to be the final, but she doesn't show up and we know why. M's girlfriend and producer of the show, Mara Stone (Aleksa Palladino), takes her spot. Dale gives her a pep talk, stating he sees strength in her to do this.Their first challenge is to go off into the woods to look for food in pairs that are randomly selected. They notice there isn't any wildlife and some don't really seem to care either. M goes with Jake and Elena. We see that they have something else in mind that is a bit X-rated. He refuses and leaves where Elena will do what she can for the spotlight, even with M. Nina and Mara get to know each other where Mara sets off a special challenge that gets Nina's attention for the lengths she goes. The other duo sees Jonesy making inappropriate jokes constantly, getting on Amber's nerves the whole way. They also come across a camp where meet is on an open flame and meat on a spicket. Dale gets a run in with some of the people that are lurking in the woods and he fights back. The others are also hunted by them as well.That's where I want to leave my recap for this movie as that gets you up to speed with what it is about. I'm not sure what I would have rated this movie in college, but I know that it is really more positive now. It is even more interesting that I've been watching Survivor and this movie is not only poking fun at that show, but legit calling it out.The premise works to get this random group of people out in the middle of nowhere for this as well. They can win $100,000 and that is reason enough to be there. It is funny that on Survivor, there are a lot of good looking people half naked, so it wouldn't shock me to see M wanting Elena to go over and above like she is speaking how sex sells. They're being the spin off type show so they really need to step up what they're selling to the audience.If I do have issues, I don't like a lot of the characters. I'll give credit though, they make them distinct enough. I'm not a fan of Nina, but I think Leerhsen is solid in her performance to get me to feel that way. I love Rollins' take on Dale. He goes full Arnold when he's hunting these mutants. Jake brings me around as there's a bit of arrogance about him, but he is a good guy at heart. I really like Mara and feel bad for what she sees. Palladino plays her mousy and it works. Amber is good. Jonesy is annoying, but that's how he's written. Braun plays that well. M is shady and again, Holmes plays it that way too. Lowe is quite attractive so seeing her nude is good and Caldwell is easy on the eyes for the small time she is there.I feel I should shift this over to the villains now. We get Pa who is portrayed by Ken Kirzinger. He brings imposing size and I like the make-up for him. He looks a bit too normal despite the horrible hair-lip they give him. They don't really flesh out the others though. I got Ma (Ashlea Earl) and Sister (Rorelee Tio) mixed up a lot. I think the make-up for all of them is good overall, but they all feel very similar to me. We also get a cameo by Three Finger (Jeff Scrutton) which I like. What this tells me is that this is an off shoot of the same family from the first one, but they're all part of the crew.Before getting away from the story, which is some thing that I wanted to bring up here as well. This movie isn't the same trio we saw, but they're all related. This expands on the mythology as well that there were chemicals from the paper mill that is affecting these people. This explains to me why they're super strong as it is inbreeding, but the genetics are altered by the chemicals. It is a bit too on the nose with a drum outside the mill though.Next I'll take this to the effects. This was a surprise to me as well. For the most part they went practical and they looked good when they did. There is some CGI in the movie that doesn't hold up though. I've already said that I liked the make up that was done for the mutants, even though I think some of them could have a bit more done to make them look different. The cinematography is solid aside from that and I like incorporating a bit of found footage with the cameras attached for them with this reality show. That fit for me.Now with that said, I'm glad that I gave this movie a rewatch. It isn't as bad as I remember it and this does feel like a good place to take what they did with the original movie. This one goes a bit more comedic, which explains why some of the characters are over the top. They give more of the back-story which I like and the reality show is a legit reason to get this group lost out in the middle of the woods. The practical effects look good, even if those go a bit far at times, but they at least look fine. CGI doesn't really hold up and the soundtrack was fine for what was needed. It really didn't stand out to me. I'd say this as a fun slasher sequel to a more serious film. If that interests you, give it a viewing. My rating would be an above average film overall.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10","7","david_rudy_lee"," Fun Follow Up Slasher Sequel

"5383","Basically, if you like slashers, you will like this movie! It has a decent cast of cheesy characters you will get to love pretty soon and you will feel a little sad when they start dying. Well, for some of them, anyway... My only bigger complaints are that the movie is sometimes too gross just for the sake of it and that there is practically nothing to really be scared of. But all that doesn't matter because this thing is just a great piece of fun for any slasher fan out there. Oh, and it has one of the greatest hero characters of all time featured in a slasher along with Ash Williams! I give it a 6.5/10 and I recommend it to all my fellow horror movie fans, not for the scares, but for fun. The rest can avoid it, as I doubt they can find something to love here.","6","markovd111"," Dumb, but self aware and fun!

"5387","So,when Wrong Turn hit the theaters,it spawned a whole lot of money,nothing really seen in 2003 yet now,so of course,who the hell knew that a sequel was on its way,Wrong Turn 2:Dead End. Now,unlike its prequel,Wrong Turn 2 has a pretty cool plot and follows a group of people who take part in a survival programme and soon enough,all of the crazy cannibals from number one,come out for a big feast. When I first watched Wrong Turn 2,I thought it was crap,another great big bundle of money token away from a horrible film feeding off something amazingly awesome,but,when I watched it with my friend a while back now,about,two years ago..it was pure gold!!

"5388","Note: Spoilers below for Wrong Turn (2003)Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is the second film in the Wrong Turn series, and this time, a reality show is being filmed in the forest where the inbred hillbilly family stalk the trees, looking for their next meal. Survival horror once again, following the success of Wrong Turn, and released in 2007, four years after release. After watching the first Wrong Turn film, I decided that I wanted to watch more of the series, and see how it played out. There didn't seem to be much to lead off within the ending of the first film, with the main villains all being killed off by Chris; there was hardly anything for Joe Lynch to direct the second film on.However, he managed to come up with a generic plot line, much like the first, but with a different generic subplot. I actually quite enjoyed this, whereas many people that were fans of the first Wrong Turn film didn't. The plot of the reality television show was really enjoyable, and I found that I really liked it. A lot of the characters are strong; not as strong as Jessie and Chris in the first film, but strong none the less.There were a few things that really turned me off about this film, and that was the crude remarks towards the lesbian character – I believe, Amber; it's been a while since I saw the film – and I found these to make me frown quite deeply, and zone out of the film for a few minutes at a time. However, the development that Jonesy had throughout the film, did make me smile. He began to become a character that I thought quite highly off, especially when the end of his story came. Nina had a lot of character development as well, and it truly warmed my heart to see how well she became a much stronger character, and someone that the team could rely on, even with how panicked she was. Jake as well was a really strong character and I loved him, and Mara was a wonderful character. There were a lot of times where I found myself with a smile on my face, and a lot of these characters felt so real. There wasn't a single character that I didn't feel like I could bump into them in the real world, and it takes a lot of good acting for so many characters in a single film – especially just another horror film – to feel so real to the viewers.The plot line, however, was pretty generic and the same as the previous film. Run through the forest, try and survive the cannibalistic murderers, don't get caught. There wasn't much substance to it, and that was a bit of a shame. I had hoped that Lynch would try and make the film a little more original than just being a basic carbon copy of the first film with a new plot, but unfortunately that hasn't happened.Considering the film was shot in only twenty five days, there could have been some more added to this. Although a very good film, especially for survival horror, I felt that there was quite a bit lacking. More could have been added for sure to thicken the plot a little, and maybe even background as to how some of the cannibals escaped death at the end of the first film. Still a good film, just not as good as it could have been.","7","SyoKennex"," Could have been better; but still a good survival horror

"5389","A couple of game show contestants are sent into the forest, but the survival struggle becomes more than play when they discover the cannibals are chasing them for real. Henry Rollins as a retired military commander hosts the show, and he seems almost to enjoy the deadly challenge, preferring it over the silly game play that had been planned by the TV makers. In the best scene, he does something funny with a stick of dynamite to a character (Wayne Robson) who returned from the original movie. However, the other actors are nowhere near Rollins' qualities. A cheap and disappointing sequel, fortunately the following sequels became better, because they didn't just repeat the same formula. I voted 8/4/6/7/5/4 for the 6 movies.","unknown_value_please_contact_support","unbrokenmetal"," Wrong Turn 2: The game show

"5390","It's been a few years since I saw the original WRONG TURN and it's a film I don't remember much about: it was okay, middling in fact, entertaining in places and completely derivative. Its sequel is a different beast entirely, as the filmmakers do away with any attempts at menace in favour of making an all-out gore fest. Indeed, WRONG TURN 2 is one of the goriest movies I've seen in recent years, a film packed full of brutal and grotesque deaths, all brought to life by the latest extreme special effects. From the opening kill, in which a woman is split in half with an axe, you know exactly what you're in for with this one.I admit to a certain fondness for these psychos-in-the-woods type films, even if the genre has been definitely overpopulated in recent years (SHROOMS, SEVERANCE, WILDERNESS, MANHUNT, EDEN LAKE and in particular BACKWOODS, which copies this film no end). The scripts are never up to much, but I love woodland scenery and it's easy to direct decent chase scenes when your characters are running through the trees or hiding out in the bushes. Here, the villains are a group of mutant redneck types, and the main characters are involved in some kind of reality TV series which quickly turns deadly. The characters are a mix of jocks and bimbos, all of them clichéd in the extreme, although kudos to the scriptwriter for not killing off the black guy first like in most of these. The only person of interest is Henry Rollins as the tough instructor who becomes a Rambo-like hero figure in the second half.All of the female cast members are good looking and the producers convince one starlet to strip off midway through for a lakeside sex scene, but for the most part the emphasis is on the gore and you end up waiting for the next death. People are shot with arrows, get axes through their heads, are slashed with machetes and a meat grinder is involved in the final few scenes so expect blood and entrails to be liberally sprayed around. It may not be high art, but this straight-to-video effort knows what it is: a gory, sometimes fun B-movie that manages to entertain despite the many flaws.","6","Leofwine_draca"," Extraordinarily grisly sequel

"5392","The storyline of the film is where they have a survival game show to be screened in America where people double up and have to survive without food and water and have to use teamwork to survive, there are also many challenges along the way. The one thing they did not know is the woods area where they were playing the game show in had mutated cannibalised humans who basically have lived there many years feeding of of humans who have got lost there or simply being attacked while on their travels.Wrong turn 2 has a bit of a twist and more entertainment to it then wrong turn did especially towards the end, you also see a lot more scenes of the mutated cannibals in this film as you did in wrong turn.The only problem with this film is that it does not have any heart stopping moments in it like there was in the first one for example when they were getting chased through the dark and hid in the watch tower in wrong turn 1But overall a good film liked it equally as much as the 1st one. If you like the 1st one you will like this without a doubt.I recommend this film and it is also not even scary so don't be put off watching it.8/10 Rated","9","roastedpeanuts-110-333323"," Overall a great film

"5394","After watching the first Wrong Turn ages ago and seeing that two sequels were out, I had no high hopes and thought that the sequel would crash and burn but I was way, way ahead of myself. As described up at the top (my summary) this film appears as a very fun, gory and very messed up sequel which works. I'm going to get to the excellent points about what makes this sequel fun to watch.The director actually gives us a decent story which we can watch and work out. He also gives us enough creepy scenes for where we can be creeped out sometimes.The director gave us some good kills and I actually enjoyed all of these kills and none of them were crappy at all. The actions sequences and chases sequences were also executed well and that made the film bump up to it's right potential.The one little problem I had though was the cannibals who didn't look as effective or as real as the ones in the first film. They were cool and it was excellent how they started up a family and they brought Three Finger back, but they just weren't real enough to say that it was at least scary.Another thing was the director said that he added humor but I found none.But overall the story is stable enough and good enough, the music score is decent, the characters are likable and the sequences of each scene was done (not as good as the original) but still good enough my liking.This sequel deserves to be watched straight after the first (something I didn't do, lol). 7.7/10","8","tequila101"," Fun, Gory and Messed Up Once Again

"5395","The second installment in the Wrong Turn franchise pares down the pure horror elements that made the original such an effective thriller in favor of considerably amping up the gore and the body count. While not quite as strong as the first outing, this entertaining sequel boasts some wonderfully demented moments, and it is most assuredly a worthy successor.Here, the cannibalistic clan from the first movie is revealed to be an extended family, and their menu is the cast and crew of a ""Survivor""-style reality show being filmed in their backwoods stomping grounds. The set-up is actually very well done, and the none-too-subtle satire of reality TV is on the mark and largely pretty humorous.Henry Rollins is clearly having a ball hamming it up as the program's host, a macho ex-Marine with a penchant for glaring at the camera and grunting survivalist catch-phrases. Later in the film, when he is forced to get dirty and combat the murderous family, he proves to be a fine action hero, and his performance is solid enough to make us forgive him for the awful music of the Rollins Band.The rest of the cast is also mostly strong, and the film-makers of this sequel apparently noted that us caring what happened the characters in the original made the gruesome fates that befell them have more impact. The biggest exception to this mindset is Steve Braun's Jonesy, who is obviously positioned to provide the requisite comic relief, but instead proves to be one of the most annoying and unfunny characters ever seen in a horror movie. Though we know from the first time we see him that he's going to be part of the cannibal clan's smörgåsbord, guessing who among the rest of the cast will make it to the final reel doesn't prove to be nearly as easy. At least one character who seems poised to survive the ordeal makes a shockingly early exit via a hatchet to the head, and Dead End earns big points for tossing in surprises like this along the way.The afore-mentioned blood-letting is doled out generously, and most of the kills in this film are absolute gore-fests. Fans of the red sauce certainly won't be disappointed, and the chain of niftily nauseating murders ensures that Dead End stands out as a top-notch splatter offering. There are also some truly inspired moments of grand guignol lunacy, my favorite being a scene in which one of the young killers stands beneath two hanging corpses and gleefully laps at the blood dribbling from their swaying bodies like a child catching snowflakes on their tongue.While the original Wrong Turn repeatedly referenced the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise, Dead End unabashedly lifts both a key scene and a key plot point. It's impossible to watch Erica Leerhsen's ""dinner"" scene without recalling Marilyn Burns sitting at the head of the Sawyers' table, and even her dialogue is almost identical. Likewise, the abandoned paper mill in this film is a functional doppelganger for the abandoned amusement park in Chainsaw Part 2. However, despite the derivative nature of some of these elements, Dead End has a spirit all its own, and since we can easily chalk these similarities up as homages, they don't distract from the effective and original twists this film brings to the table (I'm not sure if that pun was intended or not).One of the most intriguing aspects of the film is how thoroughly the cannibal family is fleshed out as characters instead of mere antagonists. In the original, the killers were simply archetypical monstrous, stalking maniacs, but this time out the film delves into the nuances of their familial life. We see their conflicts, their rituals, their grotesquely affectionate interactions, and we even see them bump uglies (literally, I'm guessing). This depth actually serves to make their culinary activities more horrifying, since the sadistic and inhuman handiwork they dish out is presented as part of their otherwise ""normal"" domestic dynamic.Dead End does have one glaring logic problem: if the merciless killers butcher anyone who comes into their woods, how did the producers of the reality show manage to install cameras and props all over the family's habitat and come out unscathed? If you don't think about this too hard, it's fairly easy to overlook, and since the main reason to watch this film has nothing to do with overt realism, this plot-hole doesn't ultimately sink the movie.The final scene promises more Wrong Turns to come, and considering how close this sequel comes to matching the enjoyability of the original, I'm not opposed to taking a few more trips into the woods. For now, this bloody treat offers enough to chew on for a while. Dead End is a hell of a lot of fun, and highly recommended.","8","happyendingrocks"," If Peter Jackson was still making horror movies, they might look a lot like Wrong Turn 2

"5396","Wrong Turn was a very efficiently delivered horror movie straight out of the package marked ""Mutated Mountain Men Cannibals Carve Up Lost Travellers."" If it ain't broke, don't fix it.Wrong Turn 2 is, not surprisingly, more of the same. There is an added wrinkle in that the jeopardised innocents are, this time, the participants and crew of a survivalist reality show, one of whom actually has some training and experience which might be of assistance in holding the inbred assailants at bay, plus a soupçon of sex has been added to the mix (by which I mean that Crystal Lowe takes her top off).Apart from that, this is the usual parade of extravagant deaths, fuelled by trying to figure out who, if anyone, will survive and, as with the first one, is perfectly well done within its limitations.I would comment that Wrong Turn 2, notwithstanding the addition of ""Dead End"", intimates that this is a sequel - it isn't. Another Dead End might have been a better title, because this is a completely fresh crop of cannibals and victims.","7","neil-476"," Efficient gorefest

"5397","The film was good especially the fact that there is a whole family that is having babies and hunting down innocent people for food. I was quite terrified when the two kids were chasing everyone and enjoying killing everyone in their sight. I was like are you kids crazy, don't you enjoying taking innocent lives and surviving to eat what you captured to devour? I really thought this was a great film. But I thought it was even more twisted than the first film. I was scared when a video had shown this guy being decapitated right in front of the camera and then the head falls right in front of the lens. I was like run dude run, run like your life depended on it, don't turn back just run like the wind, don't stop just run to the road and get help! When that scene was shown when the cannibal woman is giving birth I nearly threw up because I must admit that was gross and sick to watch. But when the dead girl was shown on the hood of their truck, I was like she's no deer put her on the back of the truck not the front that's disgusting! I suggest not let anyone under 13 or younger watch this film because they will get sick or not sleep for days.

"5398","The movie started off promising alright but it then turned very fast into something much worse. The movie became a lame and cheap looking horror flick, that picked an uninteresting and also unlikely approach. It just didn't worked out as an horror at all. But luckily the movie its second half was something much better, when the original approach of the movie gets totally abandoned and gets replaced by something simpler but far more effective and enjoyable.Basically the movie is still being like a lot of other genre movies but I still like and appreciate this movie for trying something original as well. At times it works out but at others it also really doesn't. It makes this a bit of an uneven movie, also considering that the movie its first half is quite weak while it's second one is simply good and maybe even a little bit more than that. It doesn't always make this movie a very good or effective horror movie to watch but luckily the movie is still being entertaining, throughout.Everything about this movie basically screams cheap and it obviously got shot in an hurry. It's a movie that can get quite lame due to its tiresome approach at times, silly weak characters and a simplistic story. But oh well, not every movie can be made with a big budget and can have a large crew and extensive production time. In all honesty, if you have to make a good, cheap genre movie, in just a couple of weeks time, ""Wrong Turn 2: Dead End"" is a good example on how to do it. Considering all of its factors and the fact that this is a sequel as well, this is simple a more than good movie.Just don't give up on this movie once you are starting to get annoyed and/or disappointed by the movie its first half, the movie soon turns into something much better, that will also please the genre fans for sure (yes, there also is plenty of gore to enjoy).

"5399","A motley assortment of participants in a reality TV show set in the deep in the remote woods of West Virginia run afoul of a vicious clan of inbred cannibal hillbilly mutants. Granted, the derivative script by Turi Meyer and Al Septien doesn't cover any fresh or original ground (it's essentially your basic umpteenth retread of such horror classics as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes""), but fortunately director Joe Lynch keeps the pace barreling along at a constant brisk clip, builds a considerable amount of tension and momentum, pulls out all the rousing stops for the lively and thrilling last third, and piles on the unsparingly graphic'n'gruesome gore with lip-smacking barbaric brio (grisly highlights include a gal getting split right in half, a hatchet to the head, one hick blowing up real good, and an especially harsh arrow through the eye gag). The game cast have a ball with their colorful roles, with legendary rock'n'roll hard man Henry Rollins the definite stand-out with his impressively mighty macho portrayal of rugged retired military commander Dale Murphy. Moreover, there are equally sound contributions from Texas Battle as amiable, sensitive jock Jake, Erica Leerhsen as the feisty and ruthlessly determined Nina Papas, Daniella Alonso as rough'n'tumble Iraq war vet Amber, Aleksa Pallidino as sweet producer Mara, Steve Braun as jocular goofball Jonesy, Matthew Currie Holmes as nice guy cameraman Michael, Kimberly Caldwell as stuck-up singer Kimberly, and Wayne Robson as a nutty old man. Better still, the delectable Crystal Lowe pops her top and bares her cute little breasts prior to meeting an abrupt'n'brutal end. The hideously malformed redneck geeks are genuinely grotesque and frightening. In addition, there's a pronounced incest angle which gives the picture an extra sick and depraved edge (we even get to see a brother and sister duo do just what you think!). The jolting outbursts of savage violence pack a really wicked punch and it's a real pleasure to watch Rollins vigorously mix it up with the freaks. Robin Loewen's polished and agile cinematography gives the picture a slick and spirited quality. Bar McCreary's ominous shuddery score likewise hits the shivery spot. An enjoyable backwoods horror flick.","8","Woodyanders"," Worthy sequel

"5400","This film could have been a nice horror movie if the director had developed the movie plot more carefully and applied better casting as the movie plot idea is not bad at all. Like this, the movie looks like childish cinema one project created on some film college. For example, very important character - the commando guy looks more like some comedian so at the beginning I was not sure if this is some Steve Martin movie or a horror. Besides, pretty bad acting of some characters is irritating. Once again, instead of intelligent action, director tends to use bizarre scenes to draw our attention. By that he also uncovers many mystic moments that he could use to create tension and fear more effectively then by using kilotons of blood with and without purpose. From my point of view, this is the worse part of the movie trilogy Wrong Turn.","2","dusan-22"," Good idea but very poor execution.

"5401","Zack Snyder's Justice League is one of the best-made and most successful DC films without a shadow of a doubt, thanks again to His Highness Zack Snyder. The visionary director manages, through the undaunted and determined flow of fans with the #releasethesnydercut movement, to bring his spectacular vision of the Justice League, presenting a spectacular film with parsimony and dedication, as only a true DC fan can do. Not only the film is deepened with a wealth of filmed material that no one ever imagined existed, but it manages to redeem itself and to fight with tight fists the previous Justice League (2017) which was a total and a colossal flop in every aspect (not Snyder's fault, of course). In this Snyder Cut all the questions that the Theatrical Cut did not give are answered, digging into the background of the characters and giving valid reasons where it seemed everything was thrown into turmoil and even randomly placed; moreover, the full potential of Snyder's direction is expressed through his unique and particular shots, also implementing and improving both CGI and cinematography, which are the perfect accompaniment to the director's vision. The four hours of the Snyder Cut are nothing more than a blaze of beauty towards these heroes, where with the old release seemed all too strange that they (production & co.) had offered so little from such a talented and resourceful director. Recall that the Snyder Cut must be contextualized and must be interposed in a timeline that had precedents and sequels in the DC Extended Universe, but now it is all to be reviewed, all to be rewritten, all to be reset. This film, as well as citing a similar case (although not entirely), namely The Godfather III Coda, totally redeems the film, putting everything in a new light, entrancing both fans and insiders and in doing so recreating a films from 0 (in fact much of the Theatrical Cut material is not present), bringing to light aspects never seen before and better set together and doing so, finally, being meaningful. Commendable and mouth-watering movie to learn more and that opens up worlds as well as in DC comics. Bravo Zack Snyder, Bravo. Justice has been served for the Justice League.","8","RinoBortone91"," JUSTICE FOR THE JUSTICE LEAGUE HAS BEEN SERVED

"5411","First of all. This does NOT feel like a 4 hour film. With a busy schedule, I had planned to watch it in the parts it's divided into. HOWEVER, once starting the movie...I was simply LOCKED IN. ZSJL is BRILLIANT. The pacing of the film is masterful, the time FLIES by, the story MOVES...but it allows for marination of what you are witnessing.The plot is simple and straightforward, but complex and beautiful at the same time. Each character has room to breathe and is developed PROPERLY. The dialogue is crisp and important, and it's clear that Zack Snyder is world building...ESPECIALLY with the crazy twists and the insane ending this movie has. The 3rd act of this film is absolutely grand.Without giving anything away, Ray Fisher's performance as Cyborg is absolutely incredible. Each character's performance is masterful. Snyder has re-established this team of Gods among people, as what the Justice League should have always been...ICONIC AND MYTHIC. The movie feels like (for those of you familiar with comics) an Alex Ross painting, or comic, or graphic novel IN MOTION, with its unique, and beautiful CGI. The CGI itself doesn't seem like it's trying to convince you of realism, but of beauty and artistry..it wants you to see each shot like a painting!BRING US THE SEQUELS!! I also believe that it is IMPORTANT, to give Zack the complete creative control he deserves for these sequels. Especially without the constraints of run time. 4 hours. 5 hours. It doesn't matter. I'm here for it..WE THE AUDIENCE are here for it. This movie has it's place amongst some of the old lengthy mythic films before it, like The 10 commandments, or Ben-Hur. The fans who fought for this vision of Zack Snyder, should be very proud...very proud indeed. A win for artistic integrity.This is more than a comic book film...its riveting, it's maddening, its methodical, maniacal, it's beautiful...as they say: THIS IS CINEMA.This...is Zack Snyder's Justice League.","10","theghostwhowalks-39050"," Beautiful, bold, and grand.

Every character took his right(main characters) , a better Batman, a more powerful steppenwolf with a purpose, the cgi has been improved and so much better than the original one , the soundtrack was amazing especially the wonder women one and the most positive thing is the fighting action scenes

Although the competitors Marvel have a well organised way of strategic movie releases and have excelled till date.This DC movie is just marvellous that even a neutral comic book audience can enjoy and also the characters in this movie are thoroughly portrayed their personalities and their motives are clear unlike the predecessor of this movie making it a perfect version of a movie.Review-
The movie has a strong sense of the impact created from the previous movie and also how the world revolves around the impact is clearly shown very early itself.
The pacing of the movie is excellent so much so that it doesn't seem like a 4 hour movie.If Marvel fans want to compare pacing lets just say being a neutral comic book fan myself the pacing can be compared to The Winter Soldier which is one the best movies too.
Each characters motives including the antagonist are clearly portrayed and the story telling is so compelling that u feel for those characters.
CGI is great in many scenes but only in some scenes are where u can have a lacking sense but overall it was good.
This movie actually feels like a compelling story of a comic book rather than its predecessor which felt like a popcorn movie.
It had a great beginning and a end where u want more of it and the character development was excellent throughout.
